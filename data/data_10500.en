remarks by speaker
speaker mr barnabas
honourable members mr prime minister madame commissioner madame minister distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen welcome
please allow me to begin by expressing my deep appreciation for the trust and confidence that you have placed in me by selecting me as your speaker
as speaker it is my responsibility to serve this assembly in the spirit of impartiality and fairness
for this assembly to truly serve the people of nunavut its elected representatives must know in this house and within its rules they have the freedoms and privileges that come with the heavy responsibilities placed upon them
i pledge to you that i am mindful of my duty to ensure that the rights of the house and its members are upheld our work starts today
as we perform our duties in this house its committees and in our constituencies we know that the eyes of those who elected us to our positions of trust are upon us
as the youngest of canada s legislatures much is expected of us
this legislature is only one of two in all of canada that does not operate on a partisan basis
rather the spirit of consensus guides us the best decisions are those that are achieved through dialogue
civility and respect are among the qualities that shall characterize this place consensus can build accountability
this house will succeed when those who make the choices that affect the lives of our families and the communities know that their actions are subject to the scrutiny of the assembly as a whole
together we will find the path - a path that is lit brightly by the fact that the composition of this assembly reflects the diversity of nunavut itself
some of us come from the assembly of our new western neighbour and we are grateful for the support of our former colleagues and constant friends
we look forward to the benefits of the wisdom and experience that members who served in the west bring with them their contribution will be matched by the ideas and perspectives of new members
the people of nunavut expect us to learn listen and act i am confident that the honourable members will work to do so - a pledge we all took just hours ago when we took our oaths
on may 25 1993 in this very room the nunavut land claims agreement was signed many of the people who were there on that day are also with us this afternoon
we thank the students of inuksuk high school for once again sharing their place of learning
we look to the energy of our youth and the wisdom of our elders to inspire us in the years ahead
i would like to take a moment to recognize the elders and youth that are with us today
elders from all of nunavut s communities are represented at this gathering - we thank them for their years of effort in achieving this day
the pages that you see come from the 19 constituencies of nunavut many of them are travelling away from home for the first time
krista eric kenny nina tommy genevieve gloria rachel jonathan jayne solomon stacey johnny itidloi jesse lorna kipanik edward qujjuk teevi fauna and jennifer - we are very proud of you
we are also honoured to have with us in the room today the honourable premier of the northwest territories mr jim antoine and former premier nellie cournoyea
i believe that you will all agree that the artwork which surrounds us is beautiful
the wall hangings that you see were made by the quqshuun ilihakvik centre in gjoa haven the tusanik school in repulse bay and the inuujaq school in arctic bay
on behalf of the legislative assembly and the government of nunavut i would like to express our deep appreciation for the beautiful painting that you see in front of the stage
it was presented last evening by the honourable jonathan motzfeldt premier of greenland to the honourable paul okalik
these symbols like the qamutik that rests on the floor will find a home in our new assembly building
i would finally like to recognize the artists who created the mace
we are honoured that they are with us today
inuk charlie joseph suqslaq paul malliki mariano aupilardjuk mathew nuqingaq and sam pitsiulak - thank you
the mace which will shortly be presented to the house is itself a reflection of the rights and authority of a democratically elected assembly
it is a gift from the qikiqtaaluk corporation and seven other inuit organizations
it speaks eloquently for itself in the way it embodies the soul of our land this assembly and our people
thank you

item 5
commissioner s address
commissioner maksagak
elders mr speaker your excellencies honoured guests members of the legislature i am pleased to welcome you to the opening of the first session of the first assembly of nunavut
this is a great honour for me to give the first commissioner s address on behalf of our new government
i would like to congratulate you mr speaker the premier-elect the cabinet and all of the members of this assembly on being called to form the first government of nunavut
the people of nunavut have put their trust in this assembly to work together in the creation of a new government in a new territory
they have elected you because they believe and trust in your will and ability to carry this work forward
our elders here today and listening to this speech on radio and on television can tell us how far we have come
they remember the times from their own lives and from the histories of their parents when inuit were alone in this land
as inuit we built our lives from what was around us
from snow and bone from the animals of the land and the sea our elders fed and cared for their families
they accomplished everything with little
they travelled thousands of miles at home in their environment and taught the next generations the strength and ingenuity to carry inuit into the modern world
the modern world is now here
as inuit we share nunavut with others who have come to join us
english and french speaking canadians people from many lands have become part of inuit communities
new tools have been introduced to our land and inuit have taken those tools and made them our own
snow and bone have turned to metal and paper
together with our new neighbours we have established towns built schools and airports negotiated a land claim and now we see the creation of a new territory
nunavut is ours but ours to share
there is work to be done everywhere
our government plans to develop a budget over the coming months and will introduce it this spring to this assembly
our government will work to deliver services and programs to the people of nunavut in a sensitive responsive and responsible manner
our government also asks for your patience and your goodwill
not everything will work the first time not every office will be staffed
there will be some delays and false starts
this is our government we built it we own it we now have the responsibility to make it work
tell us when things go astray and we will work with you to make them right
our government will develop a legislative agenda for presentation to this assembly
this will begin our journey towards creating nunavut solutions laws policies and programs
in continuing this journey we commit to listening to the people of nunavut and continuing to be guided by the people s needs
mr speaker this is a day of ceremony and celebration
it is appropriate that our government is introducing today the flag act which will designate the official flag of nunavut
i am confident that the people of nunavut will be proud to see this symbol of our new territory flying in all our communities
thanks are due to more people in more ways than words can express
to the peoples of canada and their governments in each province and territory who have supported nunavut over the years
we thank you with all our hearts and we are proud to join you
to the peoples of the northwest territories as we leave them for having travelled so far with us and for having been companions on our journey
we thank you and wish you safe journey as our paths part
to our elders who first dreamed to our leaders and negotiators who first spoke the dream to our children who have taken the dream into their hearts and lives
we owe you everything and we will work to earn the trust we have been given
today we join hands with you in the birth of nunavut
speaker
thank you madame commissioner
now i would like to invite the hon jane stewart minister of indian affairs and northern development to address this assembly
ms stewart
item 6
presentation by the hon jane stewart mp minister of indian affairs and northern development
hon jane stewart min indian affairs and northern development
mr speaker it is indeed an honour to be present at the first sitting of the new territory of nunavut
respected elders commissioner and prime minister i join your voices in congratulating the premier-elect the members of cabinet and the members of the legislature on their achievement to date
mr speaker i congratulate you as well on your selection and i listened to your advice to your colleagues in your introduction
i don t expect that you will have the beautiful voices of the youth here to guide you but certainly it will be the youth and their future that will guide your decisions
you will be supported by the elders and by the symbols that are in your legislative assembly that remind you of who you are from whence you come and the significance of your responsibilities
for years the people of the eastern arctic have dreamed of a territory they could call their own
and while it has not been easy individuals organizations and government have long worked side by side with vision and determination to make the dream a reality
today we are celebrating the fruits of our labours nunavut
this realization was carried out by the residents of nunavut for the people of nunavut
recall the northwest territories of 1870 a vast expanse of land by any measure east to west north to south
already home to aboriginal people it was soon the land of opportunity for newcomers
a territory diverse in both population and geography
responding to this diversity canada has redrawn its map over time
today out of the still vast northwest territories canadians have created yet another territory that reflects our democratic vision
that territory is nunavut our land
this evolution goes to the heart of what makes the canadian federation strong government s ability to grow in lockstep with the aspirations of her people
as other nations around the world struggle to define themselves often with great human cost we count ourselves very lucky
ours is not a history of war and conflict it is one which is inspired by co-operation by balance
we have built a strong country in which we are masters of our own destinies
with nunavut canadians have once again taken the opportunity to make choices about their future
those elders gathered here today have never doubted that it was the right choice
and through their decades of hard work towards this moment they never doubted that if you can dream it you can do it
as nunavut takes its place in the canadian federation it will be tested
you know as do i that expectations are very very high
you must create jobs improve health keep youth in school
the government of nunavut you will be called upon to do all this and much much more
but i believe this is a territory and a people that are ready and up to the challenge
of course we can t predict exactly what the future will bring but i am convinced it holds tremendous promise for the people of nunavut and canada as a whole
in fact across the north in nunavut the northwest territories and the yukon there is exciting economic social and political change underway
change that brings northerners the tools and control they need to build strong self-sufficient economies and communities and an even brighter future
just as the path of progress led us west in the twentieth century so the path of opportunity leads us north in the twenty-first
the government of canada is proud to have been a partner in this important undertaking
the creation of nunavut
thank you to all those whose commitment has brought about the birth of nunavut
congratulations to you the political leaders and to the people of nunavut
thank you and best wishes
speaker
on behalf of the assembly i would like to thank you for your remarks
the chair will now entertain nominations to adopt the premier and executive council
mr hunter tootoo honourable member for iqaluit centre
item 7

mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker
whereas section 55 1 of the legislative assembly and executive council act requires that there shall be an executive council of nunavut

item 8
premier s address
mr okalik
respected elders mr speaker those who have visited mr prime minister minister stewart madame commissioner please feel welcome in nunavut
as all of the nunavut residents i am very proud of this moment and in having been selected as the first premier for nunavut
i wish to thank the members of the legislative assembly for their support and encouragement in my selection as premier
in the past two weeks i have enjoyed working with the cabinet and the regular members
we have already dealt with a number of issues and i look forward to working with you for a productive five years in our future
as you all know we had a long hard journey towards nunavut
there was a lot of hard work but we have reached the end of the journey and it feels like we have completed a lot of work
the inuit of nunavut have settled the largest land claim in canadian history
when we look at the canadian map we have reshaped that map today
those are very symbolic gestures and they are a very big part of being a new territory of nunavut
for those who have been elected to positions and have created a government based on the principles of human rights there are a lot of outside people who have admired what we have done
we would like to create a government that is founded on integrity and openness that is one we can be proud of
on this journey in trying to get nunavut there were troubles many have fallen
there were a lot of very special people who could not be here to celebrate with us today
some of us have lost family members to suicide and some have lost relatives to the land as they were out harvesting the resources trying to live the life of our forefathers
some of us have known those who fell victim to abuse and aggression
but it has always given me strength because we have to look to the future while respecting and remembering those who we lost who are here today and watching us
in respect of those dear people i would like to ask for a minute of silence to remember those who did not reach this day
i would ask for a moment of silence
>> moment of silence observed
thank you
today the eyes of the world are upon us and as well the eyes of nunavut are upon us and watching
our ancestors are also watching us
they look to us the people of nunavut
in their eyes there is hope and expectation that we will succeed and as the premier i will have a lot of responsibilities and i know i will have to work very hard
i do not take that lightly i accept that responsibility and i will continue to place first and foremost the people of nunavut because that is part of my job
we are going to have a government that has many responsibilities and that cannot be taken lightly
the people from kugluktuk to broughton island from sanikiluaq to grise fiord will have to help us
all of the nunavut residents will have to work hard for our future has to be well planned in order for us to succeed
i have gone to every corner of nunavut and i know that in the future i am confident we will accomplish a better future
to date i have seen a lot of strength and character in my fellow inuit and those who are willing committed and determined to work
we have to demonstrate that we can deal with the problems our society faces because we are the only ones that can fix them
our children especially because they are watching we have to prove ourselves to them and stand out as better role models
i pledge to you the people of nunavut that the government of nunavut will work to ensure that there are the right conditions to assist you in making change
we will make it possible for you to rise up and get an education
we will make it possible for your families to move forward
we will make it possible for our communities to grow in a healthy way
we will put conditions in place for you to make nunavut strong again
to the people of nunavut nakurmiik qujannamiik matna koana thank you and merci
in closing i would like to echo comments by my colleague ovide alakannuark we are no longer dreaming
this is reality
we have arrived
--applause
speaker
i would like to thank the members of the legislative assembly of nunavut and thank the premier for his words
i would like to ask the prime minister mr jean chretien to address the assembly
item 9
address by the right honourable jean chretien p c mp prime minister of canada --applause
right hon jean chretien prime minister of canada
mr speaker on behalf of the people of canada i am honoured by your invitation to address the first ever meeting of the legislative assembly of nunavut
i would like to offer my congratulations for your election
compared to the election of the speaker in the house of commons in 1993 that took almost a full day it was done pretty rapidly here and i would like to congratulate you
i want to congratulate the premier for having won the confidence of his colleagues here during the recent election
i would like to tell him that it took me thirty years to become prime minister and you became premier in two weeks
--laughter/applause
i would like to tell you that it is a great privilege to serve as leader
it is both a serious responsibility and an incredible opportunity to shape the direction of a government and build the future of a people
each and every member of this honourable assembly deserves equal praise and recognition
you will go down in history as the first government of nunavut
in you the people of nunavut have invested their faith and trust
an investment that is never made lightly but never more so than when a people take their first steps into a whole new future
i never lost sight of that basic truth about elected office through thirty six years of public life
governing is very different from the business of getting elected
i learned that lesson soon after i arrived on parliament hill
the trail of a victory is quickly replaced by the awesome amount of work that must be done
as nunavut takes flight you are dealing with immense challenges
whether it is educating your fast growing population alleviating poverty and social breakdown or building the capacity within your own government to address these challenges you have your work cut out for you
work that will require patience creativity and tremendous energy to resolve
fortunately the people of nunavut are blessed with these qualities in abundance
your new premier and cabinet are fine cases in point
you have the added advantage of being able to draw the best from both worlds
traditional inuit teachings and values that have passed down through the ages and a modern government structure with access to state of the art technologies
unlike in years past the north of today is no longer hostage to geography and climate
it is very much a part of the wired world with equal access to the opportunities for growth and development that it presents
i have no doubt that you will find the solutions that you seek
that you will build on these strengths focus your agenda on what can be achieved and set your sights on what matters the most to your people
i want to assure you of the government of canada s commitment to being an active partner in your work and ensuring a new passage to the new millennium
i also want to remind you that your contributions to canadian society will extend beyond the boundaries of the new territory
your insights and ideas will be welcome as we address national priorities
your unique northern perspectives and your consensus approach will be valuable as governments throughout canada work together for the common good
just as the qulliq has served as a beacon of hope and illumination of your people your presence on the national scene will shed new light on how we can build a better country
nunavut is an acknowledgement that there is strength in diversity
that government works best when it is closest to the people that we will only move forward as a nation when we all move forward together
indeed among my proudest achievements as minister of indian affairs and northern development was helping create the first fully elected legislature in the northwest territories a milestone on the road to nunavut
it was great days in some ways when i was naming the members until i named one and he decided to vote against my instructions
so i decided it was better to have everybody elected
i have high hopes and expectations of the men and women in this auditorium
i am confident that by building on your rich inuit heritage remaining true to the people who elected you and embracing the support and encouragement of all canadians nunavut will be a great success
i look forward to watching your nunavut dream become a reality in the days and years ahead and i will look for your inukshuk as you lead the way
good luck congratulations and a happy nunavut day
long live canada long live nunavut
--applause
speaker
on behalf of the assembly i would like to thank the prime minister of canada for being with us on this most historic day and for his gracious remarks

appreciation and acknowledgement of educators
hon james arvaluk interpretation
mr speaker it gives me great pleasure to stand in our legislative assembly to pay tribute to all educators across nunavut
i would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts and considerable energies which educators across nunavut have brought to our early childhood programs and to our schools
we are fortunate to have dedicated and committed school staff who are working hard to lay a firm foundation for our children s education
their commitment to developing the critical skills processes and practices which will allow our children to lead successful and productive lives is the backbone of our school system
their appreciation of our children s language heritage and cultural identity is what makes our classrooms and schools welcoming and affirming places to learn and grow
it is a great pleasure to thank them for their hard work and also to encourage them to continue on with us as we build our new educational system in nunavut
we are fortunate to have exceptional educators who work as language specialists teachers student support assistants cultural instructors and school community counsellors
there are elders and community resource people who share their skill and wisdom
there are parent volunteers who support their children s learning and promote the school activities in the community
there are dedicated members of dea s who work diligently to ensure that the schools are meeting community goals and that teachers are supported in meeting those goals
these individuals are critical to the smooth operations of schools but they are also the important links that allow the school to reflect the community and the community to be represented in the school
i also want to acknowledge the role of educators which each of us has to play
our children s learning is the sum of all their experiences
as parents aunts uncles relatives and so on we all influence and have opportunities to enrich the learning and experiences of children in nunavut
i challenge you to take this responsibility seriously and to actively join us in making nunavut a network of community teachers and learners
through this kind of collaboration we ensure that our children can be the best they can be and we are all enriched by that
the nunavut teachers federation is holding their founding meeting this weekend
i would like to take this opportunity to wish them all the best
please help me acknowledge and show appreciation to our educators of nunavut for all the hard work commitment and groundwork they have done for education
let us stand an applaud them
thank you mr speaker

congratulations to labrador inuit on land claim
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
today i would also like to have the opportunity to congratulate the inuit of labrador on successfully reaching their land claims agreement
i know that this has been a long and hard struggle with very few resources
i recall back in the 1970 s when the late bill edmund struggled to get newfoundland to recognize the need to deal with the issue of aboriginal rights protection
if bill were still alive today he would be mighty proud of them
we are all proud of their perseverance believing in their own people and keeping their issues in historical perspective allowed them success on this historical day
there s much work ahead which will be just as difficult but the light at the end of the tunnel will give them energy and anticipation for a challenging and fulfilling trip
i m sure the people of nunavut will support them and assist them any way possible to reach their final destiny
once again on behalf of nunavut congratulations
thank you mr speaker

oral questions
speaker interpretation
oral questions mr iqaqrialu
question 6 - 1 2
inuktitut documentation
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker and to the ministers and all the members to the legislative assembly
i have a question to pose to all of you some of us members
speaker interpretation
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
thank you now i know better i will direct this question to the government leader of nunavut
for those of us who are inuktitut unilingual speaking members and cannot read and write english
i would like to ask the leader when the government will be giving out documents in english all the documents should be translated into inuktitut so that we can have a good input
i understand that is self-explanatory
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
although this is an oral question i would like mr havioyak to respond
hon donald havioyak interpretation
those documents that have not been translated some of them are being worked on and we personally are working on them at this time
i will make sure that these documents are translated before they are given to the members that speak only inuktitut
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
oral questions
mr irqittuq
question 7 - 1 2
high costs of transportation
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the cost of living is very expensive today because we have to transport the goods by airfreight
if i were to order one snowmobile from montreal to hall beach the freight would cost over $2000 00
or if you send goods by the post office it is very expensive too because it s almost twice as much to send something through the post office
mr speaker i would like to ask our premier if he will be looking into this issue
thank you
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
premier if you would like to respond it is totally up to your discretion
i think this question could be posed to a few ministers either to the minister responsible for transportation or mr ng
would you like to respond
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker mr speaker we know that our government does have several subsidies that we provide to our constituents
thank you
speaker interpretation

oral questions
mr puqiqnak
question 8 - 1 2
letter to minister on challenged constituent
mr puqiqnak
interpretation thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct this question to the minister of education
i wrote a letter to you mr minister i am sure you have received the letter i have sent you dated april 3
there was a person who died in my community on that date who had adopted
that person is an adult now twenty four years old deaf and mute
since he is deaf and mute i think he really missed his adoptive parents especially his father
he was acting differently after the father died
we spoke to the step-mother and we spoke to that person who is adopted as to how he or she wants to be educated
that person wants to go to school and he or she felt he or she would feel much better after leaving the community
i would like to ask the minister what his position is in regards to the letter i sent him
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation thank you before the minister replies i would like to elaborate that you don t have to make reasons for your questions you can ask your questions directly
minister arvaluk
hon james arvaluk

question 10 - 1 2
traditional curriculum
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to address this question to the minister of education
yes i really appreciate the fact that our children have a chance to go to school in academics
i was wondering what you are going to be doing about traditional education because there are many students up there who require traditional instruction
thank you
speaker
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
interpretation mr speaker his question i can answer his question and it would probably take all day to answer his question
the response would be quite lengthy perhaps if my friend can tell me what he is talking about in detail
are you talking about inuktitut curriculum traditional on the land or inuktitut language instruction
perhaps if you could be more specific
speaker
interpretation mr arvaluk thank you
could you rephrase your question mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i was thinking more when i said inuktitut curriculum of survival out on the land and how to go hunting and how you survive out on the land especially in winter time
also making traditional clothing such as caribou clothing
in the past we used to utilize the traditional clothing more but now it is not being used today and many young people are freezing to death so that s my question
mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr alakannuark
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
interpretation thank you mr speaker
we ve only been a government for just a little over forty days but we ve already been discussing how the previous government was within nunavut
i met with the baffin divisional board of education last night to discuss this matter or to discuss this issue
we are committed to working on curriculum that could reflect the inuit culture to utilize the inuit qaujimajatuqangit whether it be in school or whether it be technical
i am requesting support on inuit knowledge traditional knowledge to utilize these how you survive on the land but this will require a lot of preparation
usually the system was such that each community was making their own educational curriculum in the community themselves without consulting with the other communities
speaker
interpretation thank you mr arvaluk
do you still have questions mr alakannuark
no
mr kattuk member for hudson bay
question 11 - 1 2

thank you mr speaker
introduction
mr speaker i am honoured to present our first government of nunavut budget
this budget address along with the main estimates which i am tabling today provides our financial position and plans for our first fiscal year of operation which ends march 31 2000
across this country tradition has finance ministers delivering new budgets wearing new shoes
in establishing a nunavut tradition i am proud today to be wearing a pair of new caribou kamiks made by respected elder bessie omilgoetok of cambridge bay
mr speaker new kamiks a new budget a new beginning
this budget ensures the early success of our new territory
it also provides a strong foundation on which we can build our future
the needs of nunavummiut are great
our expectations are high
but like the journey taken by the founders of nunavut which led to the creation of our new territory the meeting of those needs and the realization of those expectations will take time
there is a great conviction on the part of all mlas to see that this happens in the least amount of time possible
government programs and services will be reshaped as quickly as possible to better meet the needs of the people
and to better meet the vision of nunavut
some changes to programs and services have been made already and are reflected in our budget
many other changes are in the planning stages and will be announced in the coming months
other more substantive reforms will require careful study and extensive public consultations
one option that does not exist is for us to fund new programs services and capital projects without regard to our fiscal means and circumstances
our fiscal plan
the government of nunavut is in the fortunate position of starting without an accumulated deficit or debt load
despite the attractiveness of borrowing money to finance current spending on needed government programs services and capital projects such actions would be short-sighted
we must avoid the problems faced by other governments
we are adopting a sound budgetary policy which will allow us to move towards improving the quality of life in nunavut
most governments including the federal government have large accumulated debt loads
the associated interest costs greatly reduce the amount of money that can be spent on health education and other important social programs
similar to other jurisdictions here in the north we have seen the impact of reductions in spending on our social programs
most governments in canada have experienced negative effects from financing current programs and services with borrowed money
interest costs on borrowed money soon outweigh any short-term benefits
we can and we will learn from their mistakes
we plan to stay debt free
mr speaker nunavut will have a balanced budget in the 1999-2000 fiscal year
our fiscal plan projects revenues of $610 million and expenditures of $600 million
we have a small 1 6 percent operating reserve to accommodate unforeseen expenditure increases or revenue declines
our projected expenditures do not exceed projected revenues
we do not plan to spend money we do not have
we are not allocating expenditures from a potential positive opening financial balance for nunavut at this time
the size of our opening balance will be determined when the division of assets and liabilities process with the government of the northwest territories is completed by october 1999
we currently do not know the final amount of this opening balance but we do know that many of the assets will not be cash
we also know that our opening balance will be reduced as a result of having to assume the financial obligations incurred by the office of the interim commissioner
our fiscal plan focuses on the strengthening of our revenue base and the management of our expenditures in a manner which best meets the needs of our citizens and the vision of nunavut
prospects for improving our revenues from our own economic base are limited in the short-term however future prospects are much brighter
our forecast of revenues from taxes and fees account for approximately 9 5 percent of our total revenues
we are projecting $57 million in own-source revenues this year
our largest source is personal income tax which we expect will bring in $16 million
other sources include tobacco tax payroll tax corporate income tax fuel tax property tax and school levies
mr speaker i am pleased to announce that there will be no new taxes or fees in this budget
nunavut given our vast area small population and lack of a developed economic base is very dependent upon federal fiscal transfers
they will comprise about 90 5 percent of our revenues for the 1999-2000 fiscal year
of the $553 million of revenues expected in federal transfers $499 million will come through the formula financing grant
the formula for this program is set for the first two years of the government of nunavut
the level of these transfers is influenced by national factors such as growth in provincial expenditures as well as by nunavut factors such as population and tax revenues
the current structure of the formula hinders the government of nunavut in benefiting from revenues of future economic activities in the territory
we will seek a better arrangement in the next negotiations
the formula financing grant was intended to allow for the delivery of the same level of services in nunavut as was provided in the area previously by the government of the northwest territories
it also made allowances for the additional headquarter costs in both territories
although the federal government provided transitional funding of $150 million additional funding for infrastructure social and cultural needs was not included in the formula financing grant
we will continue with efforts to have our additional needs addressed through the formula financing grant and through other federal transfers
we are hopeful that a stronger national economy and an improved federal fiscal position will allow room for positive federal responses
mr speaker independent of our success on the revenue side we plan to act in a responsible manner in our development of expenditures policies and our delivery of programs and services
being responsible means using our resources efficiently and effectively setting priorities making choices being innovative and being open to change
as well it means operating in a fiscally responsible manner and living within our means
we plan to reshape and manage government programs and services in a manner which best meets the needs of nunavummiut
the achievement of these objectives will require the input of all members of this legislative assembly
it will require the involvement and support of our other northern partners
it will require the dedication and commitment of our employees
above all it will require the wisdom of the people of nunavut particularly of our elders
stability in our programs and services
mr speaker the reshaping of government programs and services to best meet the needs of nunavut is a complex task
many reforms will take considerable time and energies
the continuity in the delivery of programs and services used daily by the people of nunavut is a major priority of the budget
to help ensure that all programs are delivered as cost-effectively as possible many headquarters and other administrative functions have been streamlined and will be delivered by central government departments
this includes information technology financial processing and human resources services
this approach to internal organization will enable program departments to focus on the provision of programs and services beneficial to the public
the budget allocates $545 million on government programs and services
an additional $55 million will be spent on capital projects throughout nunavut including nearly $20 million on social housing
the departments of health and social services education and community government housing and transportation account for over 60 percent of nunavut s spending on programs and services
the departments of public works telecommunications and technical services justice and sustainable development account for another 25 percent
mr speaker i will now highlight some of the departmental spending initiatives for this year
the department of finance and administration will continue the electrical power subsidy to ensure that all nunavut residents continue to have access to reasonable utility rates
this will cost $3 8 million
the department of justice will continue to provide $830 000 to support nunavut s 3 regional legal aid clinics
the department of community government housing and transportation will continue to provide assistance to hamlets in meeting their operational costs through the municipal operating assistance program
this program will contribute $18 7 million in this fiscal year
in addition $5 2 million will be provided to communities to help offset the high cost of water and sewage services to local residents
the department of culture language elders and youth will provide $1 8 million in grants to art councils and cultural organizations
the department of education will provide $72 4 million to territorial schools $13 6 million to nunavut arctic college plus $28 million for income support
it will also add 17 teaching positions across nunavut by reprofiling current expenditures
this will help the department to accommodate the increased number of students and maintain its present level of service
the department of health and social services will provide $44 4 million to support hospital insurance services in nunavut
as well it will contribute $4 9 million to community wellness programs
this department also will continue to support a broad range of children s programs including the children in care program and the early intervention program spending a total of $3 2 million this year
the department of sustainable development will provide $12 5 million in grants and contributions to a wide variety of associations and organizations
these contributions include
$1 3 million to nunavut tourism $1 0 million to the nunavut business development fund $1 8 million for community initiatives funding and $2 9 million to the nunavut development corporation
the capital program for 1999-2000 incorporates projects where contractual arrangements were in place by the gnwt
also included are projects having legal or regulatory requirements or involving health and safety concerns
social housing projects and projects supported by federal contributions insurance claims or other external funding sources were given priority
the use of these criteria allowed us to initiate a capital program in time to meet the 1999 construction season
in the coming months we will be starting a 5-year capital planning program which will involve extensive consultations with mlas along with communities
in addition to the capital program outlined in our budget there will be many other construction programs carried out this fiscal year
the government of canada will be providing $9 3 million in funding for water reservoir improvements sewer lagoon improvements and other capital projects
nunavut construction company ncc will continue a major office building and housing program in support of our decentralization plans throughout nunavut
in addition we are actively pursuing private-public partnering arrangements to provide much needed health and education facilities in our communities
by partnering with nunavut s business community we can develop local expertise and skills create employment and maximize the benefits from our resources while building our needed infrastructure
our budget provides a stable environment to plan for nunavut s future it allows us to begin addressing the challenges we face and the priorities of our people
our environment and challenges
there are major geographic demographic social and economic challenges that we have to contend with in order to improve the lives of nunavummiut
our territory encompasses almost one-quarter of the land mass of canada with a population of approximately 26 000 residents
our 28 communities are only accessible year round by air or by ship during the short summer season
our geography causes the cost of providing essential programs and services to be very expensive
an example of this is the $15 4 million we must use to provide transportation for our people to access health services not readily available in our communities
our population is growing three times faster than the canadian average 64 percent of our people are under the age of 30 and more than 45 percent are under 20
this creates ever increasing demands and pressures for health and education services as well as for housing and other social programs
in our largest social program education and health and social services we have started the process of reform
planning for efficiencies between departments and board administrations is a major step in that reform
we also know that recruitment and retention of staff in these important program areas needs to be addressed as a priority
both the honourable james arvaluk and the honourable ed picco are committed to dealing with these initiatives and the task of ongoing reform
we are looking at ways we might work with the federal government to address the shortage of new social housing
the cmhc funding we have in place will decrease over the next 20 years so finding new ways of dealing with this matter is crucial
the honourable jack anawak minister of community government transportation and housing has recently announced an extension of the minimum down payment assistance program
this program provides nunavut residents with a grant of up to $15 000 to use as a down payment to purchase an existing home
the availability of adequate and affordable housing to meet the needs of our growing population is one of our highest infrastructure priorities
the nunavut court of justice has been established
this is a single level of court that is unique in canada
along with this there will be increased support for justices of the peace so more cases can be dealt with by community members within their own communities
meeting our social challenges will require a commitment on the part of our government and the people of nunavut
we know that in nunavut we have an economy that is unique in canada one that affords great opportunity for development
our government holds that all our people should be able to participate fully in these economic development opportunities
nunavut has enormous natural resource development potential
last year the mineral exploration industry invested more than $70 million here
we are committed to improving employment opportunities across nunavut and we will continue to support economic activity that is based on our traditional way of life
later this session the honourable peter kilabuk minister of sustainable development will address in some detail the issue of the development of our economy
this budget provides additional financial support for a nunavut prospector program a nunavut arts and crafts association harvester support programs and community economic development
economic development depends in part on our ability to attract investment both private and public
the nunavut land claims agreement provides a stable economic environment in addition to our resource potential
as a result private investor confidence is strong
we must look to the federal government for a high level of partnership and commitment in our economy
the government of nunavut is working with federal officials to act now on their public commitment to develop a northern economic strategy
we are working to establish an economic development agreement between the government of canada and nunavut
we await a positive response from our federal partners on several current economic initiatives which are crucial to the growth of our economy
these include infrastructure development a partnership on geoscience and negotiations on the development of our fisheries
we must encourage our partners in both the public and private sectors to invest in the diverse economic opportunities we have throughout nunavut
and we must consult with the people of nunavut to ask for their participation in planning the development of our economy
if we plan well and make effective choices nunavut will have a bright future
making changes
the choices we make in the coming months will greatly affect our future
we must take the time necessary to ensure that our changes make programs and services better suited to nunavut s needs and vision
we have to be realistic in our expectations
priorities will have to be established
i want to assure you mr speaker that over the coming months we will consult with mla s and the people of nunavut in considering any and all future plans
we realize expectations are high and the desire for change is well founded
however changes will take time to implement
but be assured that our government is committed to change
a key will be our ability to be resourceful innovative and more efficient
we will have to do many things differently
a good example is the recently announced amalgamation of health and social service boards into the department of health and social service and the divisional education boards into the department of education
another good example is the decision to pursue private public partnering arrangements to provide some of our capital needs
one of the most important elements in the delivery of programs are our employees
the nunavut employees union which represent the largest number of employees has indicated that they would like to reopen negotiations for the current agreement which expires march 31 2000
the other union the federation of nunavut teachers has already given notice to begin the collective bargaining process
their current agreement expires august 31 1999
we will examine with the unions more innovative ways of compensating employees
however we must be aware that the outcome of these negotiations will have an impact on our current and future budgets
key to meeting nunavut s challenges will be how to manage all the future pressures for funding from limited financial resources
questions will have to be asked about how best to do things
the government can not answer these questions alone
input will be sought from the people of nunavut
together we will make the necessary decisions in the best interest of our land and its people
if we incorporate the knowledge of our people particularly our elders and community leaders we can establish a path that is right
our task as government will be to work with the people in all our communities to find the best way to move forward
this will take time but we will move forward
knowing where we spend money now will have an influence on where we set priorities in the future
doing something new will mean changing the way programs and services are currently provided
before we make any changes to our programs and services we must know the impact that such changes would have on the people of nunavut
we must be mindful of inuit qaujimajutuqangit iq in what and how we do things
whatever the situation change will only be introduced after the people of nunavut have been consulted
the issue is not whether changes will be necessary but rather when and what changes will be implemented
establishing our priorities
one of the most challenging tasks for any government is to identify priorities that matter to people and would make a difference in their lives
our government will address this challenge in a manner befitting the efforts that have led to the creation of our territory
there are three broad goals for the government of nunavut - establishing a more appropriate and better government
creating healthy communities families and individuals
and becoming more self-reliant
with regard to better and more appropriate government we will consult widely and listen to our people
the people of nunavut must be able to identify with all orders of government - municipal territorial and federal
our government will become more accessible less complex and more effective
we will work hard at improving our social programs
government will help provide the means for people and communities to make meaningful improvements in their daily lives
our approach will be wide and varied - from improvements to social housing to better education programs and more effective health programs
again we will listen to our people to tailor a nunavut strategy for developing healthier communities healthier families and healthier individuals to overcome our social challenges
to improve the daily lives of our people we also will need to become more self-reliant
this will mean more employment opportunities it will mean investments in education and training of our human resources it will mean investments in improving the overall health and well-being of our citizens
we will have to work closely with nti and other organizations to foster an atmosphere of trust and cooperation
we will have to get more from our resources
this means using our present resources wisely while pursuing new resources
we are committed to the negotiation of an agreement with the federal government that would enable nunavut to share in the prosperity of its natural resources
such an agreement would be a bold step forward enabling our government to be more self sufficient and less reliant on federal transfers in the future
establishing our priorities will enable nunavut to have a successful beginning
in mid june after the budget session there will be a caucus strategic planning retreat to deal with setting priorities as another step towards change
conclusions
mr speaker i am pleased to have presented a budget that will not only ensure the early success of our new territory but also will provide a strong foundation on which we can build
the needs of nunavummiut are great and they will be met
like the journey undertaken by the founders of nunavut we will need some time
we are committed to orderly change to ensure that our policies as well as programs and services will best meet the needs of our people
we will consult we will listen and we will initiate change change that will have long lasting benefit to all nunavummiut >>applause

people of a community working together to achieve a common goal or purpose
there has long been a desire for a co-op here in iqaluit

oral questions mr iqaqrialu
question 18 - 1 2
construction of road to keewatin
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the premier
the road that we were talking about yesterday in keewatin
my question
is that road viable for all of nunavut would it benefit all of the residents of nunavut
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we have no highway whatsoever in nunavut from southern canada
i think that once we have a highway anywhere in nunavut i think that it can benefit all the residents of nunavut in terms of cost savings
i think it can benefit everybody in nunavut
speaker interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr iqaqrialu second question
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
also my supplementary question will be that the building of this highway is going to be very expensive and there s going have to be feasibility studies done prior to the construction of the road
the funds that will be expended for the study would that come from nunavut government budget
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
hon paul okalik interpretation
yes thank you mr speaker

north american fur and fashion expedition
hon peter kilabuk
thank you mr speaker
i would like to reply to a comment that was made on may 13 1999 by glenn mclean member from baker lake
mr mclean was kind enough to acknowledge my participation in the north american fur and fashion exposition held earlier this month may 5th to 8th 1999
speaker interpretation
please sit down
i apologize it was my mistake you may go ahead and do your ministers statement mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk
thank you mr speaker
i ll go on from where i left off
first mr speaker i want to thank the member for baker lake for his generous remarks
the north american fur and fashion exposition provided nunavut with an opportunity to show our pride in our hunters and the importance of our sealskin by-products
i was proud to be there to represent our people and to speak about the importance of sealskin and other furs to our way of life
mr speaker i have no hesitation about educating the public outside of nunavut concerning the sale of our by-products such as sealskins
i believe it is our job to educate people about seal hunting in nunavut
it is our job to stand up for our culture
i am not at all reluctant to further educate lobby organizations with the facts to further promote our lifestyle and culture
in nunavut mr speaker our use of wildlife is today as it always has been sustainable
our seal hunt is a humane harvest
and every part of the seal we hunt is used - for our food and for our clothing
this is our tradition
this is our culture
our people have the right to continue this way of life and to hunt seal for their livelihoods
on the first day of the fur show mr speaker i addressed a news conference on the topic the importance of wildlife use for people on the land
this was followed by an interview on canadian television and by the american press
that evening more than seven hundred people attended a fashion show and dinner described as a tribute to nunavut
the fashion show featured the nunavut collection twenty-three beautiful sealskin coats
during the show i received a commemorative plaque from the fur council of canada and the north american fur and fashion exposition
the inscription on the plaque reads mr speaker to the people of nunavut
canada s first furrier
>>applause
the following day mr speaker i was able to speak with children at a school in montreal and to explain how inuit use the seal
this message was taken to three other schools in the montreal area
later that day my department sponsored a reception at the fur show which was attended by more than three hundred people
i believe mr speaker our message is getting through
at the montreal show the nunavut collection sold out
>>applause
i m told there were many many orders taken
our hunters our people were recognized and applauded for the sustainable and humane way we conduct our seal hunt
our message is being heard by more and more people around the world
our nunavut sealing strategy mr speaker is making progress
mr speaker to continue making progress our government must challenge the current trade restrictions that are imposed in the u s
through the marine mammal protection act the sealing strategy developed by our department highlights our cultural background economic opportunities and educational initiatives for both harvester and purchaser
if i may mr speaker i would like to recognize the staff of the department of sustainable development and in particular the work of larry simpson and ken toner who organized our participation at the montreal show
ms aaju peter from iqaluit made a series of excellent presentations in the montreal schools
monica ell from arctic creations was there also carlene arreak lucy idlout sylvia ipirautaq-cloutier eva sowdluapik phannelie palluq and vinnie karetak modelled sealskin clothing and performed traditional songs and dance

repatriation of inuit artifacts to nunavut
hon donald havioyak interpretation
mr speaker i would like to take this opportunity to speak on the need to return our artifacts to nunavut
over the last century many anthropologists and explorers visited our country and were amazed by our artifacts
they took the liberty remove these artifacts our tools our clothing even the bones of our deceased relatives and bring them back to their homes to studied and displayed
as a result of these items being taken nunavut is empty of our precious properties
okakti the artifacts represent our history the possessions of our ancestors they represent the way our great grandfathers and mothers lives
they represent inuit qaujimajatuqangit
with the people who removed them our artifacts have travelled far and wide and have taken their places on display and in storage areas of many universities and museums
most of these institutions believe that they came upon these artifacts honestly and feel very possessive of these artifacts
most institutions have preserved these items with great care
from that point of view i am proud of the way they been preserved
but we need them back
my department has been tasked as the guardian of our inuit culture and heritage
my department wishes to ensure that the inuit culture and heritage is defended and preserved
my department wants to ensure that many of the items that have been removed from our homeland be returned to nunavut
in order to bring back any artifacts nunavut has to have sufficient storage space to locate these items
mr speaker we need a heritage centre in nunavut my honourable colleagues we need your support in pursuing this important initiative
our department is working with birthright corporations in nunavut to promote our objective
discussions have started between our department and with nunavut tunngavik incorporated and with inuit heritage trust
through inuit qaujimajatuqangit we want to promote and reinforce community identity
we want to work with inuit organizations and nunavut communities to design the programs that would be housed in this nunavut heritage centre and how we can share these programs throughout our territory
our partners and i are committed to pursuing the requirement for a central facility which we in nunavut can gain knowledge from our past and be educated for the future koana okakti

question 3 - 1 2 incorporating inuit culture into government
hon donald havioyak interpretation
yes thank you mr speaker
on may 12 mr kevin o brien asked a question about inuit qaujimatuqangit
this member asked me a certain question and this is the answer to the question
interpretation ends
inuit traditional knowledge is obviously going to cost a certain amount of money
first let me say that iq is the work of various nunavut partners
iq was first discussed during the meeting of the elders that took place in igloolik in march 1998
this meeting was sponsored by the nunavut social development council under the article 32 in the nunavut land claims agreement
mr speaker the government of nunavut is a member of the working group committee of the nunavut social development council
our department was designated as a member of the working group
our mandate is to report our findings to the government of nunavut on inuit qaujimatuqangit
to date we have been discussing the topic of iq with other government departments within the government of nunavut
our discussions have been based on the ideas of incorporating iq into other departments
this topic of iq is going to be a long-term program which will be eventually be utilized by most of the government departments in the government of nunavut
it is going to take time however we are going to have it more understood by the government personnel through various means of communication
with respect to the question of funding i am unable to answer the question until some time when the legislative assembly reviews the estimates and approves the bill

thank you mr speaker
when you are trying to go to the baffin region from keewatin we have no mode of transportation directly
airline travel being the only way to go you have to go through a roundabout way to get here and airline travel is very expensive
i think we can look at alternative ways with more direct routes than there is now
i realize minister that you are new to this as we are and we expect that you will do something about this in the future
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
mr anawak would you be able to respond to that
hon jack anawak interpretation

i sent a letter to him last week about the proposed arena and i had a meeting with the mayor and council recently about that also
they told me what they want to do and asked if i could help them with that
i asked them to write a proposal and get a letter of support from the community so i have already responded to that and we are working on that question

gym for pelly bay
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to ask a question to the minister of government operations
this is in regards to the school gym
are you going to be looking at this concern from pelly bay and will there be a gym built this year
speaker interpretation
this is for the minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
looking at the budget and the speech that was made by the finance minister the priorities we have placed on these facilities are if there are safety concerns or health risks
with those priorities in mind and in reference to the members comments we do not have any plans to build it this year but it is in the plans but it is not in the 1999/2000 budget
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
questions mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
i should have addressed that to the minister of education
so what year are we looking at building that gym
speaker interpretation thank you mr alakannuark
mr arvaluk hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we were slotting it for 1999/2000 but the government has agreed to prioritize existing contracts ones that have been signed already those that are health or safety risks
we have made that decision because of financial restraint and the gym that the member is referring to was slotted for 99/2000 but because it is not a safety or health hazard we have placed it to another year
i am just following what i have placed in front of me and it is going to be at the discretion of the members here as to whether they are going to approve the budget

on friday may 14 the minister gave us his budget address

community empowerment & sustainable development review of departmental business plans 1999/2000
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
bear with me my colleagues
this was a last minute opportunity for me here
the standing committee on community empowerment & sustainable development report on the review of draft departmental business plans preliminary information on the 1999/2000 main estimates
the committees report reflects the unique circumstances surrounding its review of the 1999/2000 draft departmental business plans
many of the committees general observations and comments will be reflected in the reports of the other standing committees
mr speaker less than a month after the creation of nunavut the standing committees met to review the draft 3 year business plans of the departments of the government of nunavut
this work was carried out during the week of april 26 and involved appearances by all ministers
members of the committees had the opportunity to ask questions of ministers and their senior officials
the standing committees of the legislative assembly were constituted at the first sitting of the assembly on april 1
the standing committee on community empowerment & sustainable development has oversight responsibility for the department of justice sustainable development community government housing & transportation and public works telecommunications & technical services
the committee has the following general observations and comments
it should be recognized that the review process occurred in a uniquely short period of time
it contrasts to the practices in the western assembly where the review of business plans and main estimates takes place over a period of several months
members of the standing committees here had much less time
indeed we fully recognize that ministers themselves had very short timelines to familiarize themselves with their departments
mr speaker the committee recognizes that the budget process this year has been unique
both the 1999/2000 departmental estimates and capital plans were substantially decided upon prior to all members having the opportunity to make input
members were disappointed at the lack of clarity provided as to how some decisions were arrived at
we expect that the budget cycle for next year will involve significantly greater consultation both with regular members and with the communities
over the course of the week of the committees deliberations the amount and level of detail of information provided by the departments improved greatly
however it is our expectation that the information flow from the departments to the committees will improve in terms of time lines and level of detail as capacity is built within the departments
we also recognize that the capacity of departments to translate all materials into inuktitut is at present limited
it is our expectation that efforts will be made to ensure that capacity development in this regard is treated as a matter of priority of this government
mr speaker the committee noted that draft business plans were inconsistent in terms of the level of detail contained
it has been pointed out that the people of nunavut need to have clear expectations of what the government can deliver
departments have a role to play in communicating clearly what expectations are realistic given the constraints that are facing us
a point which all committee members noted was the frequency with which all of the departments referred to the concept of iq and its importance to the new government in terms of decision making
however there appears to be as yet little progress yet in defining and operationalizing this concept in any particular or systematic way
the success of its implementation depends upon people at all levels of government having a clear understanding of the concept and its critical importance
the committee were encouraged to hear ministers speak of the need to establish a close working relationship with the regular members of the assembly
the committee hopes that this commitment will be reflected in the way the government responds to our concerns and recommendations
regular members look forward to making a strong positive contribution to this government
thank you mr speaker

mr chairman i will now conclude by stating that the department of finance and administration has made a lot of progress in meeting its broad mandate

thank you
chairperson interpretation

mr akesuk
thank you mr chairman i will report in english
minister ng appeared before the committee on the morning of april 29th
the main estimate summary provided to the committee indicated a total 99/2000 expenditure of 27 million 547 thousand 673 dollars
as with the department of the executive and governmental affairs the committee recognizes the role finance and administration plays as a central agency
the department mandate is to provide the government of nunavut with advice on matters relating to fiscal management and to ensure efficient government wide management of financial resources
citizen involvement in budget development
the committee was intrigued at the draft business plans reference to providing for public information in the budget formulation process
the committee will be supportive of efforts to hold community workshops in which members participate in hearing the view of the public
the committee also recommends that the department make an effort to provide clear budget information to elders and the public
the committee appreciated receiving a detailed briefing on federal/nunavut fiscal relations
the committee is supportive of the departments mandate to aggressively pursue revenue enhancement opportunities with the government of canada
the committee was also advised that these costs are offset in the ffa
the committee recommends that the department continue to make strong efforts in these areas
the committee would also like to be regularly updated as the department identifies one- time or unforeseen costs associated with establishing the new government
the committee would like to receive a full accounting of these costs to the government of nunavut
the committee also recognizes that a number of issues may not have been finalized yet

comments to the department of finance and administration
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would prefer that maybe after they make a report i will have a few things to state or should i pose my question now
chairperson interpretation
the minister already made his report and now it is open for comments and questions mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in respect to the deficits that they alluded to which is the 4 million dollars for the oic
we were told where it had come from and it affects the nunavut government because even before we were up and running there was a deficit outstanding
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu did that answer your question or do you have any further comments
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
that way it is creating a problem unless it is clarified both to the mlas because they have to understand for what the payables have been incurred
because we never did the work of the office of the interim commissioner so i just wanted to state that again mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman once the final audit is complete and the accounting for the financial affairs of the office of the interim commissioner there will be a breakdown of the expenditures under that office
thank you
chairperson interpretation
further comments mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
i would like to see that in our future meetings
chairperson interpretation
is that just a comment or do you want to answer that mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman we have little choice in the matter
unfortunately it is a legal agreement
the office of the interim commissioner had the mandate through the nunavut act to operate and do the preparatory work for the establishment of the government of nunavut
once the government of nunavut took office on april 1st became a legal entity the office of the interim commission dissolved
i mean obviously it would have been ideal if that wasn t the situation but unfortunately that is the matter that we have to deal with and the legal obligation is there
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in respect to the same item or within the same arena in respect to the deficit of the oic which was stated to be 4 4 million dollars
in respect to the funds that had to be taken out for example some of the capital projects that we have planned had to be taken out to meet the 4 4 million dollar budget
was that the case where we had to take away capital projects in order to pay this 4 4 million-dollar deficit
hon kelvin ng
no mr chairman that wasn t the case
what this affects is the opening balance of the government of nunavut
in effect it is a liability that is offset against the assets that would be coming over from the division of the assets and liabilities with the g n w t
it doesn t affect the current year the 99/2000 fiscal year per se
thank you
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
i guess my question is just wondering in the report the audit that the minister alluded to will there be in there explanation as to how such a sizeable deficit was obtained
i know that we all know that the federal government had federal advisors right at the highest levels i was wondering how if they were aware of this how they let it get to the level it was
if that will be pointed out in the report
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
which of you would like to answer this question
hon kelvin ng
so we will have to wait just like anybody else the outcome of what s in that and what kind of comments or recommendations that they might have
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
if you re just going to wait is there something that the department will be asking their federal counterparts as to how they let it slide for the 4 4 million dollars over
thank you mr chairman
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
they also have a chance to dialogue with the auditor generals staff as they move forward analyzing the report
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman i guess that still doesn t answer
will the department be approaching the department that was responsible in diand for ascertaining if they were aware they were going to run this deficit and how they allowed it to happen thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman there has been some discussions but i think also that the premier has brought up the issue with the minister of diand and spoken to her about it
but as it stands now until the final results are in i think things are kind of in a state of waiting until the final report is out mr chairman
thank you
thank you mr chairman mr chairman it is an accrued liability
as i indicated it ll off set some of the assets that we have coming over from the gnwt in the division of assets and liabilities
there are plans to go forward and try to recoup some of those costs
whether or not we re successful there s another matter i guess but it s certainly an issue
thank you mr mclean please recognize the chair because you ll have to recognize me as i am the chair
chairperson interpretation minister or his deputy or his assistant deputy minister
mr chairman thank you
mr chairman it isn t a 99/2000 year expenditure
it s an opening balance liability because this is the first time we set up and it s an opening balance sheet item
it ll reduce that balance that was coming over though as far as the opening balance goes
thank you

mr minister you ve indicated in your budget in reference to revenues it includes 3 million dollars in revenue from property taxes of school levies
will this money go back into general revenue or does it go back to the communities where we generated it from
chairperson interpretation
minister of finance & administration
i really want to give you an inuktitut name
mr ng

as long as it s a good one
mr chairman all revenues that the members see there go into the general consolidated revenue fund and are disbursed based on appropriations through the assembly and the recommendations of the government

another tax question
in reference to the payroll tax
thank you
chairperson interpretation
minister of finance & administration
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
it returns more to lower income earners than what it takes in
they get a rebate back and i believe that it s 1 1/4 % instead of 1% for the lower income earners within the territory
so that s another issue that would have to be taken into consideration of the review of this specific tax
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr minister are you considering any new tax reform initiatives over the next year

mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i want to pose this question to minister of finance & administration or his i don t know who s responsible for this
respect to the hamlets they usually have funding for one fiscal year to be used within that year and the budget have been cut throughout the year and i guess my question is related to that
are the hamlets i think some of them are leery because their budgets are getting cut and they re concerned that their budgets might be cut for their operational funding
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark you may answer this if you wish or we could wait for a response until we get to the minister of municipal and community affairs
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
i think i tried to indicate in my opening comments that we ve tried to provide as much stability as possible during the course of this years operation
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
that s it
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr minister your budget address sets out an important goal of the government of the nunavut to have a balanced budget this is very important
how will your department ensure that other departments do not go over their budget
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister of finance & administration mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman we plan to be monitoring the expenditures on a regular basis of the other departments
in fact right now we re providing a lot of the financial support services for those departments because they don t have their financial management sections up and running fully yet
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister of finance & administration mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
so yes there are situations where that happens
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
those types of deficits will they have an impact on the government of the nunavuts budgets as ultimately they receive their funding from the government
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister of finance and administration mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
so there s no direct legal liability to the government of nunavut but obviously since they are organizations that we re supporting we would work with them and we would try to get them out of that situation
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman obviously if we are to take over responsibilities for those specific boards we would assume the liabilities or the assets in that kind of circumstances for their operations
thank you
chairperson interpretation
i guess this is a last question
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess in light of all that has your department or have you considered introducing balanced budget legislation
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman as some members know the northwest territories and other jurisdiction have balanced budget legislation and that could restrict going into too much deficit
it is something we can look at at some point
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
now the nunavut government as you are looking at the operations we have to look at the holiday pay and benefits
what are your plans for re-implementing the benefits packages our employees use to have
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr minister you may answer this or if you prefer it just be deferred to the human resources minister
hon kelvin ng
i ll speak on his behalf i think
mr chairman there are no plans to reinstate any of the benefits that were eroded when the government of the northwest territories underwent their deficit strategy in trying to curtail their spending
i think it s safe to say that we know that there s expectations amongst the two major unions
once the collective bargaining process begins will have to wait until the positions are formally tabled and the negotiations are hopefully successfully concluded
but it s really premature at this time and even if we did have an inkling of what we were proposing i mean this wouldn t be the appropriate forum to bring that forward mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
in some ways it was beneficial where some of the benefits were cut because of other residents in nunavut who did not have those benefits
still past employees miss those benefits and they re expected to have them reinstated
i would ask a person be appointed or you work with employees unions that there be a working committees struck to review this issue
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
we re going to be waiting until human resources comes up
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation

mr o brien
mr o brien

my question to the minister relates to forced growth and i d like to know what the minister has factored into the budget regarding forced growth what s the status on this issue
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr minister i believe you indicated that there s was approximately 10 million dollars in the reserve
given that factor if there s nothing in the budget right now for forced growth looking at the way we re expanding here in nunavut and we ve been looking at power subsidies and so on
is it fair to say that it wouldn t take very long to chew up that 10 million dollars we d find ourselves in that situation which mr tootoo was referring to and find ourselves basically over spending
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
thank you
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
just one final question in reference to this area
talking about forced growth and the 10 million dollars that we have now in reserve and some of the factors that will cause some concerns in the coming months
how has the minister considered the decentralized modelled in reference to this budget
i know you ve indicated that which certain positions may not be filled so maybe some money is left over and of course that s not my wish nor some of my colleagues here
we see the decentralized model as probably the corner stone one of the corner stones of the nunavut government
so how has the minister incorporated this into his overall budget
thank you
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman within the departmental budgets now i have the understanding that they are funded to the levels of the decentralized model
thank you
mr o brien
mr chairman we ll hold the minister to that

mr chairman i am just asking if you are going to provide detailed information on how you are going to collect taxes
thank you
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson yes we will provide the information if it is the detail that the honourable member is asking for in respect to how it is collected
we will also provide the breakdown of the categories
thank you
chairperson interpretation
any further comments
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
minister just a question in reference to one of the pension plans that was set up by the former government and how it relates to this government here
it is my understanding that the pension fund after all of the pensions were paid out there would be approximately 9 million dollars left over that was going to go back into the general funds
would the nunavut government see any portion of that 9 million dollars
chairperson interpretation
minister ng or one of his officials
hon kelvin ng
mr chairman it is my understanding that it is part of the division of assets liability agreement on the table that was entered into and agreed upon for the division of assets and liabilities
so we will get our 44% portion
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman in reference to the division of assets and liabilities
can the minister tell the members exactly how the process is set up and who from the nunavut side is involved in this process to ensure that we get a fair and equal division of the assets and liabilities
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson i ll ask mr tootoo to speak to that one as he was heavily involved in the aspects of that
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
the agreement itself has been signed for some time it s in the implementation stage
i was personally involved with the negotiations around the agreement and up until the signing and slightly afterwards
now for the implementation there is an implementation committee set up to administer the agreement
rod malcolm is here today as well he s the assistant comptroller general and he s nunavuts lead representative on the implementation committee for the division of assets and liabilities
he and his staff are the ones who will be ensuring that the agreement is implemented in the spirit it was negotiated and that nunavut gets its fair share
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
it s my understanding that this government is to enter agreements rather to contracts of approximately 50% plus services i guess from the gnwt
can the minister tell members how that is impacting on this government
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
so they have the staffing dollars that are going to be used for the contracting fees
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson each department made their own contractual arrangements for services
but generally speaking i would think that they would be more of a cost because there would be some administrative fees on top of providing the services back to our government
thank you
chairperson
thank you
i believe those are just comments
anything else further
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
in reference to the same question that was brought up in regards to contracting back to the territorial government
i believe that it s going to cost more and i hope to see the nunavut legislative assembly seek contractors within the nunavut area instead of going outside of the nunavut territory
i believe that we will have to work hard to find contractors because of course we will be spending more in the long run if we contract the territorial government
chairperson
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson a lot of these services are provided by a government that already have the infrastructure established and it can t be provided by a general contractor because of the speciality and the expertise
thank you
chairperson interpretation
iqaqrialu is that all
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation yes
i apologize mr chairperson
thank you mr chairperson
it s a very important subject and i believe that if we contracted from the nunavut government from the nunavut area it was just recently that this part of nunavut was established
we have to look at ways and means as to how we can increase our economic development around the nunavut area
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson i don t disagree with the member just the matter of the timing in respect to trying to build the capabilities within our own civil service to carry out those functions
thank you
chairperson
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i wanted to return to a previous issue in regards to income tax
as we heard income taxes that are being deducted from both the federal and territorial government does that mean that we will also be deducting a nunavut income tax from our salaries
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
yes mr chairperson the nunavut income tax is a percentage of the federal tax that s collected
so we set the nunavut personal income tax rate and it s remitted to us from the federal government as part of their overall collection of income taxes
thank you
chairperson interpretation
any further comments questions
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
maybe to use an example of the provinces the rest of the provinces pay provincial taxes
for example in the province of ontario they pay 7% pst
and my question is is there going to be another level of tax imposed on the nunavut territory
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
right now mr chairperson right now no there hasn t been any additional taxes put in place for the nunavut territory
the nunavut territory has no provincial sales tax
the nunavut territory has no sales tax
and it s the same income tax rate for personal income tax that we ve taken over to date
thank you
chairperson
okay
good
mr nutarak was that you
maybe they can t hear me
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
in reference to mr nutaraks question what he was trying to ask the minister was is there going to be a nunavut services tax sometime in the future
is there going to be an established nunavut services tax sometime in the future
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson it s too early to say one way or another
we ll see what the sense is to develop the next budget
thank you
chairperson interpretation
very good now
questions or comments if there s nothing further
quite a lot of hands came up
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you
you mentioned 500 thousand hundred dollars for p3 initiative
can the minister inform us what projects this will include
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson this doesn t go into any specific project per se
it s for the development of the government of nunavut s policies and procedures surrounding how we would implement and go through the public/private partnership arrangements
thank you
chairperson
i still have two names on the list and after these two have spoken we ll take a break
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
just going back to that general question you indicated earlier that the formula financing agreement allows for the decentralized model
in your budget address you indicated that this formula financing grant is intended to allow the delivery of the same level of services in nunavut as was previously offered by the gnwt
do you feel confident that that same level or are you comfortable with that same level of services will be provided to the residents of nunavut based on the resources that we have to work with
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson that is bit of a subjective question
thank you
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
going back to another question you mentioned that the over-expenditure from the oic office would be a liability that s been carried forward that s going to be offset against assets that we re getting from the gnwt
i m not an accountant but explain how something that was incurred in one year is offset against something coming in from another area
i m just wondering if you could clarify that for me because it s not totally clear
thank you mr chairperson
hon kelvin ng
i guess the way i would understand it if i m wrong the accountants sitting here could correct me
so the 50 less the 4 we would have 46 million dollars opening balance in respect to assets on april 1st 1999
that s basically my understanding of it
thank you
chairperson
your last question mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson it s my understanding that the audit of the oic operations may be concluded by the end of june
around that timetable
for the assets and liabilities with the gnwt is october of 1999 i believe where that is supposed to be concluded
thank you
chairperson
we ll get back to you later on
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairperson
my question to the finance minister is the allocation of capital dollars is based on standards criteria health safety and other factors
the standards and criteria that we brought over from gnwt are old and outdated
it s probably 10-15 years old
is your department looking at setting standards and criteria and health and safety factors that reflect the true needs of the people of nunavut
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson we haven t undertaken that exercise as yet
the plan would be to undertake that but the problem we have of course is the timing
no i ve given the priorities of trying to get things up and running as it stands now
we can only do so much with so many individuals and we all recognize that we have a lot of hard working staff but they re not all fully staffed yet within the departments
so there s a lot of issues that we have trying to get operational right now that has been the priority of all of the departments
thank you
chairperson
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairperson
this will be my final question to that answer
thank you
chairperson
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
normally the department of public works our public works telecommunications and technical services have a big component of the development of standards and criteria in respect to facilities
i don t know what kind of timetable they would have
probably when the minister comes you can ask on that
but certainly in respect of overall goals and priorities the five year capital planning projects that we re planning on undertaking this fall those kind of issues would be relevant in those discussions thank you
chairperson
perhaps we ll take 10 minutes short break
thank you
>>committee recesses
chairperson
i apologize
we ll just continue on with the department and i will just continue on with the names on the list that i have
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
there s a feedback somewhere
thank you mr chairperson
in regards to this is a supplementary to mr tootoo s comments although mr ng had responded by saying that there will be negotiations on the division of the liabilities and assets
but when you state that the regular members have no authority or input according to the way you responded will we have input or will we be involved or will we participate
will we participate during the process of dividing the assets and liabilities
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
thank you
minister ng you may respond now
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson there s no plans for mla s or for ministers for that matter to participate
this is strictly an officials function because the formula and all the agreements were agreed upon prior to march 31st
they re signed off by the government of the nwt and the office of the interim commissioner in respect to percentages and what counts and doesn t count
it s all laid out in the division of assets and liabilities agreement that was agreed upon by the legal entities that had the authority to enter into discussions and make the final agreement
so we re following through in implementing what ever that agreement was just to make sure that there s nothing that falls between the cracks
thank you
chairperson
member mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
prior to the establishment of the nunavut government all these processes were prepared before the election of the legislative assembly
i feel that the members of the legislature should be involved
once we have been elected we should be involved in the process and we should also be involved in the agreements that have been signed off
since after being elected can t we make changes as members of the legislative assembly as elected people
we also state that in the programs we would like to see programs according to the needs of nunavut residents
we should be involved and we should deal with this issue again
even though the agreements have been signed off with the territorial government and nunavut government i would like to be able to make changes and amendments to the agreements that were signed off
because during my campaign that s what i spoke about
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
minister ng would you like to respond
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson i guess the way i would explain it is it s not a political negotiation it s not a political exercise
it s strictly an accounting of officials work is what it comes out to because there s an agreed upon criteria to divide the assets and liabilities
so that s the only way i can explain it for the member
thank you
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
i m finished
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
mr chairperson there s been some fairly detailed news coverage on the 20 million dollars that s going to be put in housing for nunavut
correct me mr minister if i m mistaken i think it just recently covered in the national news and so on
can the minister tell us exactly how that money is going to be distributed what type of housing
thank you
chairperson
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson when the minister of community government housing and transportation comes before the committee we ll have the details of the breakdowns and the programs that are being proposed for those funded under his department
i don t have that detail before me
in respect to the budget i present the broader government programs highlight some of those programs to the assembly and deliver the budget speech and the details
that s why we have the cabinet and the ministers that are responsible for their portfolios to provide more of the details of what their programming is mr chairperson
thank you
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
i understand what you re saying mr minister and that s fine if we re talking about one hundred thousand dollars
we re talking about 20 million dollars
let s say we have $20 000 000 00 dollars for housing is it for social housing
is it home ownership
you must have some preliminary concepts you are going to pass out to the members here
thank you
chairperson
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson we are dealing with the finance and administration department budget today and broader government responsibilities and initiatives that will fall under the department of finance and administration
again i don t have the details for the community government housing and transportation budget here and it s more appropriate for that minister to be responding to the programs within his jurisdiction not me as a finance minister
thank you
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
i ll accept then mr chairperson if the minister doesn t know what exactly the 20 million dollars is for
but i think we ve gone through a lot of detail this afternoon on various issues and i just thought that it was a more than fair question to find out if it was social housing or home ownership
i think it is pretty large sum of money that we re talking about
i thought that information would be readily available
no more questions thank you
chairperson
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson i had indicated i m not the minister of cght
i know that the 20 million dollars is for delivering up social housing programs
home ownership is a whole blend of a housing component
it s pretty broad when you talk about housing and the minister has that detail
i don t have that detail here
if i had it i d provide it to the member
thank you
chairperson
your last question mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
i ve indicated that i accepted that the minister did not know what the money was for and that s fine
thank you
chairperson
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
although you responded to this question i would like to comment on it further that we will go into a deficit a little bit over 5 million dollars
would the minister be able to look for new dollars from the federal government to be utilized for this deficit because it seems that this deficit is not the responsibility of the nunavut government
this doesn t look too good for the new nunavut government would the minister be able to look for new funding or new dollars to be utilized for the deficit
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
yes mr chairperson the intent is that we would pursue with our federal counterparts at every opportunity some of what we felt were their obligations instead of ours
thank you
chairperson interpretation
do you want to make a supplementary comment
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
mr chairperson my name is irqittuq not erkidjuk
you and the premier i would be able to give you some advice so you would be able to take it along to the federal government
we have been helping those albanians while there are many people sleeping on the street in canada and in nunavut we are in a deficit
so i can support you out if you need more tools or bullets if you want to go down to ottawa
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson i appreciate the members comments
thank you

mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
earlier i asked about how your department would ensure the other departments wouldn t go over budget and you indicated that you are just going to monitor them
are there any more detailed plans as far as what the exact processes will be in place other than that we are just going to keep an eye on them
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
member for iqaluktutsiaq mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson as i think i also indicated because a lot of departments didn t have their financial management services in place yet that the department and finance & administration was providing those services for them
so we are processing all of the payments and we are doing all of the details on the financial side for all of the departments so we re right there first hand in respect to the expenditures of the departments
all ministers also sit on the financial management board where all expenditures of the government are co-ordinated
thank you
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
somehow i knew you were going to say that
is there a process in place if some one comes back partway through for additional resources for the department
what s the process involved there and will those resources have to be cut somewhere else to make up for that
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo that is your last question
mr tootoo
is there a set criteria or something that is used in that or is that something that is brought up on an as discovered or as needed basis
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr ng do you want to respond to that
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson there are pretty stringent financial management board guidelines that outline the expenditures that departments have and in what circumstances they can come for supplementary appropriations
so those guidelines are there and ultimately its the financial management board that approves or disapproves after justification based on those guidelines that are put forward
thank you
chairperson interpretation
i have no further names on the list of members of the legislative assembly
are there any further comments from the floor
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
mr chairperson another question personally i would like to thank the other members for sticking around to hear this a prelude i guess to what you are going to be in for for the rest of the week
my last question is in regards to lease costs that are being incurred by the nunavut government
i understand for example that the legislative assembly building is now being those lease costs are being incurred by the government of nunavut
i am just wondering if the minister has an answer to that
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr ng if you wish to respond
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson that question is more appropriate to be answered by the minister of public works telecommunications & technical services who has responsibility for buildings standards and criteria
thank you
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson if you could respond to the question
i am sorry mr tootoo is that all
comments questions members comments
now with respect to the budget assumptions and main estimates we are going to go to page 34 3-4 under directorate
so if you could open page 34 in your government of nunavut main estimates binder in 3-4 the directorate are there any questions or comments in respect to the directorate
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i stated earlier at the top in 6 - 08 in respect to the inuktitut translation i understand that this is 608
i would like the members to have better understanding because as an inuk i understand this to mean 608 dollars and it is kind of misleading
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
we will reach that shortly but we are dealing with the directorate
if there are any other comments in respect to the directorate we are still in 3-4 item on the directorate and the total expenditure for operations and maintenance is 825 thousand dollars
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
historically it has been done in thousands of dollars thank you
chairperson interpretation
i would now pose the question as to whether the 825 thousand is approved
agreed
capital items
there is no total capital for the directorate
there is nothing in respect to the capital items the total expenditures for the directorate budget stands at 825 thousands dollars
a member
agreed
chairperson interpretation
agreed
open the next page to 3-5 fiscal policy and expenditure management
the operations and maintenance in total is 3 million 30 thousand dollars
in respect to the capital there is nothing in the total capital budget items and therefore the total expenditures for fiscal policy and expenditure management is 3 million and 30 thousand dollars
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i am just wondering if the minister in going through each of these could just provide us with the total number of py s in each division and a total number for the department
if that would be possible
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson in this particular branch 8 1
chairperson interpretation
does that answer your question mr tootoo
mr tootoo
just asking if he could do that for each division so we can get a total for the whole department
thank you mr chairperson
hon kelvin ng
oh you want it for the whole department
chairperson interpretation
we are still on page 3-6 financial services
the operations and maintenance in total is 1 million 213 thousand dollars
agreed
capital items there are no capital items for financial services so therefore the total expenditures are 1 million 213 thousand dollars
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
again i would just like to know the total number of py s that are involved
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng 11 2 in financial services
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
in financial services this is a division that looks after all of the other departments
as the minister indicated earlier they are going to be providing all of the financial services for all of the other departments
i am just wondering if that includes taking that into consideration or did that take into consideration each department having their own finance division
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
i will ask mr vardy to respond to this one
mr vardy
okay the financial services division will provide support to the financial services staff in all departments but there will be capacity built up in each department
it is more a support and co-ordinating role in the first probably four years in the new government
after once you get the capacity established in the departments that group will get smaller in finance and we will have controls through the comptrollership role like the government accounting as well as the budgeting
its a transitional type service we are providing not only to departments but also to boards and agencies to make sure there are proper financial systems in place in the government
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i would imagine that this number over time would go down as those responsibilities are devolved to the departments
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
yes
chairperson interpretation
we are still on page 3-6 the total expenditures is 1 million 213 thousand dollars
in respect to informatics in 3-7 the total operations and maintenance altogether is 4 million 506 thousand dollars
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman i wonder if the minister could just speak briefly as to what their actual plan is for this informatics technology program i guess
how do they ensure that all of the communities have access to this and it is as user friendly as possible

i ll ask mr vardy once again on this one mr chairperson
thank you
mr vardy
the informatics program of the government of nunavut could be a very massive expenditure
it is one of the main reasons why the oic went over their budget is because of underestimates of the cost of setting up the technology in a decentralized manner throughout the territory
what we have in finance is the systems development side and in public works they are responsible for the operations and the technical side of the system
in the systems development side we have a budget of around 4 million dollars for next year
if you develop the type of it system that everyone would like that is if you tallied up the requests from all of the departments we could easily spend 10 times that in nunavut next year
with regard to the actual set up of the network in each location it is probably a better question to direct to the department of public works
what we have there now the big systems are the payroll system human resource management system the peoplesoft
its one that is critically important but is an area that if its not tightly managed you could easily chew up a big portion of the budget of the territory
i think there is a desire on everyone s part to have the most advanced system in place but in a territory of this size we can operate without having such systems in place right away in all departments
i think it is a goal that all governments have of having those systems
in the north as well we have to look at the trade off between it and other communication modes including air travel
it s a high priority area to get a handle on
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
i am sure that it is a major task and fairly expensive
just my last question and without getting into detail when this does occur when we have a finished product is it the intention to have it in french english inuktitut
mr vardy
mr chairperson
definitely in english and inuktitut
i don t know the extent that we will have the programming done in french
chairperson interpretation
i wanted to speak shortly and remind you to please recognize the chairperson before you speak and please wait patiently while the chairperson recognizes you
we have to stick to procedure
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
just on the py s
thank you mr chairperson

mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
in respect to the computers and the informatics if i didn t just hear about computers i have heard about the y2k bug and that there will be problems with all of the computers
is this going to create a big problem for the government the y2k bug
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
i believe you are speaking to computers but could you speak to the y2k and what effect it may have on the government
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson first of all in answer to mr tootoo s question it is 4 5 py s and we think that all of the systems we have in place are y2k compliant at this time
thank you
chairperson interpretation
are you going to respond to mr iqaqrialus question
hon kelvin ng
i was trying to say in response to his question that we think all of the systems we have are y2k compliant so there won t be any problems
a lot of the stuff was developed recently after identification of the potential y2k problem
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
let s proceed the total expenditures is 4 million 506 thousand dollars
agreed
there s nothing in capital items so therefore the total expenditures for informatics is 4 million 506 thousand dollars
agreed
some members
agreed
chairperson interpretation
okay
let s proceed to the next page 3-8 comptrollership the operations and maintenance budget is 17 million 974 thousand dollars
there are no capital expenditures therefore the total expenditures for comptrollership are 17 million 974 thousand dollars
agreed
the next page 3-9 details of grants & contributions
i wish to ask a question to the members
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
in respect to this issue i don t quite understand the meaning of this in relation to the itemized budget
perhaps if you could clarify the items in details of grants & contributions
hon kelvin ng
go ahead mr vardy
chairperson interpretation
mr vardy you may proceed
mr vardy
mr chairperson the grants & contributions occur in different divisions throughout our department
in government accounting we have insurance premiums of 1 5 million dollars
sorry in response to that particular question 3 8 million is for power subsidies
it is just a continuation of the existing subsidies that the government of the nwt had in place
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu supplementary
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
in respect to the 3 8 million dollars and how much expenditure we may be looking forward to the power plant which is supposed to be built in clyde river
perhaps there will be different rates for the different regions in nunavut for power
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
this is again based on maintaining stability in programs
it is based on the yellowknife market rate for power consumption and i believe it is subsidized for private homeowners up to 700 kilowatt hours per month based on that yellowknife rate
it is an ongoing program and it is what was spent on the nunavut side last year and it is a continuation of that subsidy
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
is this geared only towards homeowners
is not everyone eligible for this subsidy
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
it is my understanding that all home operators have accessibility to the subsidy program so you can be renting a unit and still get a subsidy on your power consumption on that unit
thank you
chairperson interpretation
did that answer your question mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu supplementary
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
while we are on this issue in relation to the budget items perhaps when mr picco is here i can pose further questions so i will just let this go
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
report on the budget for detailed grants & contributions
i would like everyone to know that they will not proceed because at this time they are for information purposes only
we are at 3-9 the details for grants & contributions
this is just an information item to help us understand why they have budgeted what they have
at this point in time i would like to ask if these are agreed to
are you agreed
agreed
on the next page 2 - 10 distribution of budget
again for your information
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
mr chairperson we are on 3-10
okay
on that i would like to ask the minister if he would explain this taking a look at the total operations & maintenance for the three regions
the baffin has 734 thousand keewatin is 1 million 103 thousand and the kitikmeot is 977 thousand
given that the baffin is twice as large as the other two regions i would just like to inquire as to why the difference in the dollar amounts
if he could explain that
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson it is mainly because the baffin region is being serviced from the headquarters division right now
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
we have about twice the population in the baffin area and baffin has 1/2 the budget
why is that
chairperson interpretation
we can discuss that at a later time
mr arvaluk did you have a comment
hon james arvaluk interpretation
mr chairperson it is the same question that was asked by the previous member
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
distribution of budget
okay then we will refer back to 3-3

mr speaker these students have had much to be proud of they have worked very hard and i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate each one of them for their commitment and dedication
mr speaker the x-ray assistants program is an example of the kind of medical training we want to see more of

students like those who graduated on saturday represent a step towards a goal of increased self-sufficiency for nunavut

congratulations to students of inuglak school
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
today i rise to make a statement and i would like to take this opportunity to highlight the recent accomplishment of some of our students and teachers for which i m especially proud
this competition is open to any school which holds a scholastic book fair and it s held right across canada
it is important to know that the winning entrants are professionally published and sold all across canada at scholastic book fairs
the winning school also receives a 1 thousand-dollar cash prize
interpretation ends
i would like to further highlight the extent of this accomplishment
that inuglak school submission was completed by students whose first language is inuktitut
i m happy to report that inuglak school won first place out of one hundred eighty entries from across canada
this is an ideal project for the students of inuglak to work together in order to create culturally relevant material that is now a source of pride
i would especially like to note the contributions of the following teachers
project advisors michael montcombroux ken jacobi sue callard

members statement 36 - 1 2 condition of iqaluit roads
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
iqaluit has the honourable distinction of being canada s newest and smallest territorial capital
however it also has the dubious distinction of being perhaps the community with the largest pot holes in the entire country
as our capital iqaluit is for many visitors the first and last sight of nunavut
a capital should reflect the beauty strength and character of it s jurisdiction
mr speaker iqaluit does all of this and more
just yesterday while driving behind our new minister of health and social services i was startled to note that the ministers van suddenly took a dip and disappeared from view
several tense seconds passed before he emerged from one of iqaluits infamous pot holes
i am certain that all honourable members will join me in expressing relief at his narrow escape
as visiting members will have noticed we wear seat belts not just to protect ourselves in the event of collision but to prevent the roofs of our vehicles from being dented as we bounce over the pot holes
mr speaker i fully support council and mayor kilabuk in their efforts to address this issue
i will do what i can to help ensure that the council receives adequate resources to fix our roads and hopefully to pave them
mr speaker our community is a capital for all of nunavut and has much more to offer to visitors and residents alike than a bone shaking drive
i urge us to get to work on this

i have a return to an oral question asked by the mla for amittuq on may 13 1999 regarding an addition to be built onto the school in hall beach
mr speaker decisions surrounding capital projects and which ones were to proceed this year were based on three criteria
a capital project would proceed if
construction work on the building had already begun there was already a binding commitment to proceed
orthere was a critical safety issue which required the work to be done
mr speaker the proposed work on the hall beach school after being reviewed by the capital projects review committee was deemed not to meet this year s criteria

there s quite a few pieces of paper in front of us especially from the communities i m representing
i m not sure where they are going because it s in transition because they keep getting sent back so i m wondering if we re playing musical chairs here with the letters from the communities
in that case for example the hamlet would be using their surplus to make this purchase
i want to raise this in the legislature mr speaker because they have been sending these copies of the letters which had been sent originally to the nwt government and i believe as well to the nunavut government

minister of community government housing & transportation and i understand this issue i believe that it s a deficit or a budget deficit in clyde river
i knew there was a problem even before i became a minister and while it was still under the purview of the g n w t government
as i became a minister i spoke with my deputy minister well unfortunately i ve not had the opportunity to talk with him about this
i know he s dealing with the issue perhaps i can tell him that it is being taken care of however i will inquire as to what the status is
i m sorry if he raises another question i am not trying to close it if he wants to add a supplementary
thank you mr speaker

mr iqaqrialu supplementary
mr iqaqrialu interpretation

thank you mr speaker

mr anawak minister of community government housing & transportation
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes they are able to deal with this and they will work with the hamlet to resolve these issues

oral questions
mr o brien
question 39 - 1 2
decentralization
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question s for the acting premier
mr speaker all the members in the room realize and know how important decentralization is to the smaller less fortunate communities
yesterday i posed a question to the minister of finance in reference to if the funding was incorporated into the budget to ensure that the decentralized model would take place
the minister indicated that the funding was incorporated into the budget and that was good news
unfortunately we also heard that the premier indicated that they have commissioned a study to re-evaluate the decentralization process
i d like to ask the acting premier as to who is doing the study and why the study is being done
thank you
speaker
two questions mr ng minister of finance
thank you acting premier
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as it stands now it isn t per se a study from the perspective of what people would perceive as a study
i think what the members have to recognize too is that it s easy to put in the position but you have to have the support in respect of housing in respect to the office space
thank you
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
mr ng minister of finance
hon kelvin ng
yes mr speaker it goes back to the priorities of the government and the timing back to the timing of the implementation of decentralization and of staffing of the government as a whole
again that s another factor that has to be taken into consideration
members recognize that not all the headquarters functions are up and running fully as it stands now anywhere from 30% to 40-45% for some of the headquarter levels of departments right now
so it s a matter of setting some priorities and having a rational schedule and timing and a plan for how we re going to implement it
that s where the difficulties are right now in respect to the government planning and procedures in establishing the decentralized model

mr acting premier
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker this government has said that we re committed to the principles of the decentralized model as they were laid out and it is a matter of the logistics
if i can use another example that has been brought to our attention the community of gjoa haven and having liquor warehousing in that community whether or not that makes sense
another matter for example that has to be considered is the community of kugluktuk and legal registries when all the support services for filing in the legal system are based here in iqaluit
those are the broader implementation issues that we re trying to come to grips with
thank you
speaker
thank you mr ng
second supplementary mr o brien
mr o brien

when do we think that we can give the communities a firm commitment

mr ng
hon kelvin ng

mr speaker can the member repeat the question please
speaker
mr tootoo
mr tootoo

the minister indicated that they would be hiring a co-ordinator to co-ordinate the implementation plan
i would take that as indicating that the department has an implementation plan that they will be implementing
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
mr arvaluk minister of education
hon james arvaluk
mr speaker after the decision was made in kimmirut and subsequently with the regular members we started wheels moving immediately after that because before the decision was made before kimmirut we couldn t foresee how the recommendations would take place
when the recommendation to have no boards was taken later then we didn t really have time to date to put all the implementation plans together before the members sat
as soon as that becomes available and as soon as we hire one that hiring does not come from the minister or the department itself it would only make a recommendation to the cabinet
as soon as the cabinet makes a decision then i would be happy to report

question 41 - 1 2
decentralized positions for hall beach
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i ve a question to the minister of finance regarding the jobs
i believe there are seventy-two and a half py s in my constituency
my question is are we going to get those seventy-two and a half py s in hall beach
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i m sure you responded to my question mr speaker but i would like to know that i would like to know whether decentralization should have started right from april 1 when nunavut government came into being
speaker
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker obviously if i could have hired all the people and had them in place by april 1 then that s the ideal situation
having said that we all recognize that it wasn t possible to do that
as i indicated earlier in my response to mr o brien there are headquarters functions that are critical in trying to get up and running and there s also the issue of the positions from the decentralized model
we are trying to plan that out in as quickly a time fashions as possible so we can bring some certainty and closure to the issue
thank you
speaker interpretation
third question mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i understood your response
with the finances allocated for the py s is there money available to move these people out to the communities under the decentralization plan
is there money already allocated in the budget to move those people out to the communities

oral questions mr mclean
question 42 - 1 2
regular members input to decentralization review
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the acting premier regarding decentralization and his comments saying that the departments of executive intergovernmental affairs and cabinet are working on rearranging the model
as we know decentralization affects 10 communities and as regular members are we going to have any input into this little quirk or is it going to be dumped on us in our retreat in baker lake
speaker
two questions
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker first of all we are not planning on dumping anything on anybody in baker lake
i think what we are doing now is trying to take an assessment on what is out there and what is available and trying to outline some of the problems
thank you
speaker
thank you mr ng
third question mr mclean
mr mclean
so the acting premier is he committed to advising the rest of the people that are effected by decentralization what decisions are going to be moved so we don t go into baker lake on the retreat and no surprises
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker most definitely there is no plan to be rearranging anything at this stage just assessing what is out there and realistically what can be done right now
that is the main basis of what we are trying to assess
thank you

oral questions mr nutarak
question 43 - 1 2
infrastructure and decentralization in pond inlet
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is to mr anawak minister of community government housing & transportation
regarding staff housing the infrastructure that is being built in anticipation of decentralization in pond inlet is slated to be built this year
i wonder if that is going to go ahead
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
minister of community government housing & transportation
hon jack anawak interpretation
i am sorry would you ask him to repeat his question please
speaker interpretation
mr nutarak would you rephrase your question please
thank you
mr nutarak interpretation
there is supposed to be infrastructure built this summer in pond inlet but there may be a delay because of the land availability there or quality of it
so my question is are the plans going ahead to build the infrastructure or are those going to be delayed
there may be some problems that will not allow the construction to go ahead because the land fill site has not been restored
i don t know what the plans are to restore the land that is near where the infrastructure is happening this summer
i want a clarification of what the plans are
speaker interpretation
mr anawak that was a question directed to you
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as the acting premier i should take that because the question has to do with the broader financing and quite frankly with nunavut construction company
given the agreement that they have established with diand for constructing the office space and the housing for turnover to the nunavut government as it stands now that agreement is still in place
the nunavut construction company with the federal government is developing that same infrastructure
we have no participation in that except for when it is finalized we assume responsibility for those lease payments
but if the honourable member has some concerns about the timing on that we will certainly find out what is going on with the planned infrastructure in his community
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
maybe i should be directing this to the minister of public works
i wonder if the old land fill site is going to be restored and if it is going to be restored this coming summer
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
i would just like to inform everybody that you are supposed to be directing the same line of questioning to the same minister and if you have other questions that you should take these one by one
interpretation ends
i will ask ms thompson to answer because that was where mr nutarak directed it
ms thompson minister of public works telecommunications & technical services
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i know that there have been some funds set aside for the land fill site in pond inlet

oral questions
mr alakannuark
question 44 - 1 2
rent scale and public housing
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will direct this question to the minister of housing
my question is that the public housing units and those people who rent them the price of rent keeps going higher
i wonder if the rent scale is going to be reconsidered in the near future
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
we have not had an opportunity to look at that yet but on his concern that will be one of the topics that we ll be covering when we have discussions on housing
the lowest rent is 32 dollars and once a person becomes employed their rent goes way higher than that
so i m not sure if this is the question that he s asking about but that s one of the issues we ll be addressing during our meetings about rent scales
we have heard in the past that once a person becomes a wage earner their rents go way up and i think they start paying 30% of their wages
so we ll be looking at this in the near future
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
second question mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark
thank you mr speaker
this is a supplementary question to the same minister of housing
the rental units in the communities are becoming scarce and we have a population growth that is growing who are demanding their own housing
so the occupancy rate per unit is very high and there s been overcrowding and that causes problems
so now is it being considered that there be more public housing built in communities
thank you mr speaker
speaker
community government housing & transportation minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we would like to see the communities be self-sufficient
that s what they want to do in their hamlet
we would like to see more communities taking the initiative to provide homeownership or make more it more accessible to be a homeowner in the communities
that s what the residents of taloyoak are doing right now and we would like to see more of that in the communities
i do understand however what his question is but i m not sure if we will be obtaining more funds for us to address this issue
our colleagues in ottawa are well aware of this problem too
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr iqaqrialu
question 45 - 1 2
nursing shortage
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is directed to the minister of health and social services
in some communities especially in the smaller communities they have one nurse in their health centres that work 24 hours a day
they are only human and they should be taking rest breaks
how are these nurses going to be replaced so that they can take their break in communities
also in some communities even though they may have more than one nurse they are still short staffed in their health centres and the nurses are expected to work 24 hours a day
do you have a program whereby these people can be relieved from time to time
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker and thank you mr iqaqrialu
it was a good question
the concern right now mr speaker is not unique just to nunavut
indeed it seems to be a national problem and that is the availability of nurses and professional nursing staff
what we want to try and do from the departments point of view is to put in place a recruitment and retention program which we re working on right now
so that we ll have a pool of nurses that will be available at the community level
what we re doing at the department mr speaker is trying to get to the point where we have a number of nurses in these communities that will actually fill the void that is there right now
for example in the communities where we have two nurses that are working 12 hour shifts that is not acceptable
we realize that
i realize that
the members of the house realize that
but after saying that mr speaker the concern is to actually get nurses get them up and to have them trained hopefully locally will be one area to look at alleviating that problem
of course we don t have that right now available to us
so one of the things that we re hoping to announce over the next few weeks is the nursing program at the college so we can hire them and have locally trained nurses
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation thank you mr speaker
i think this is a major concern and i think this has become a crisis
i know that if you decide to address it quickly and treat it as a first priority i think that you can do something about that
i would like to see you deal with this as soon as possible
especially in the area of nursing shortages so that people can take comfort that if they should get ill they will be taken care of
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker yes mr speaker indeed my department and the government take the issue of shortage of nurses very serious
as i said before it s not just unique to nunavut
indeed we just heard a couple of weeks ago that mr harris of ontario was putting about 250 million dollars back into the health care system and hiring 10 000 nurses
we ve got to look at recruiting nurses from the same jurisdictions that ontario alberta british colombia and other southern provinces are looking at the same pool of people that are available
we have to look at on the recruitment and retention side what we need to put in place to maintain and retain the nurses that we have working for us
indeed many of the centres right now have what we call the nightingale nurses where they come up on contract and they work for 3 months and they go back to south
that s not providing the continuity we want to see in our communities
so i agree with the member
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i m talking about the area of nunavut
specifically i m not concerned about the rest of canada or southern canada
rather i m talking about nunavut specific issues
are you also involved in recruiting nurses for areas other than nunavut
i m concerned about filling the positions in nunavut
speaker
thank you iqaqrialu
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
i ve known mr iqaqrialu for a long time and i know that he s asking that question very seriously
nurses just don t come out of the ground
they have to be trained there s x-number of nurses available and we re competing against other jurisdictions
when we re competing against other jurisdictions to get nurses to come to the north we have to be able to offer them a good benefits package
we want to offer them good working conditions
indeed mr speaker those are all the things that we re looking at in the retention and recruitment program
mr speaker i want reiterate that i live here my wife my children my in-laws my relatives my friends we all use the same services that you do
that s what i meant by saying that we re trying to recruit nationally
we have to compete against those other jurisdictions
and it s not easy
one of the reasons why we re looking at health boards and elimination of health boards is to be able to take a nunavut perspective
so we should be hiring nurses for nunavut not for specific regions of our home
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
last and final question mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my final question
if we re just going to be recruiting from outside of nunavut i don t think that that is acceptable
but for the nunavut residents i think that we can also train health care professionals for nunavut specific jobs
i think by providing educational opportunities and training opportunities in nunavut that would stop a lot of recruiting that s happening right now in southern canada
nunavut nurses can learn to be nurses in nunavut
i think that would solve a lot of our problems
perhaps education programs or program funds should be identified by your department so we don t have to keep looking outside of nunavut to hire these people
speaker
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
mr speaker i agree with the member
earlier today i made a statement where we had nine x-ray technologist graduates here at nunavut arctic college for the first time in nunavut
i think we should be very pleased and happy about that
we have already seen the successful completion of several of our residents trained as community health representatives chr s
mr speaker we ve had an entrance program two years running now for the nursing program
at the end of that program over the next several months and years we ll have trained nurses here in nunavut
that s what i was talking about when i said we have to train people here in nunavut
that s how we will be able to hopefully supply a market for local talent
that s the way the department is looking at it and that s what we re trying to bring forth
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
i will now ask members that haven t asked questions yet to ask questions i know i have your name mr o brien but i ll allow mr akesuk to ask questions
mr akesuk oral questions
question 46 - 1 2
arctic college nursing training program
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
maybe this is directed to the minister of education
at one time at the arctic college there was a program that was getting underway at to train nurses
i wonder if the program is going to be reinstated and for that to be able to go ahead in this coming semester
speaker interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
minister of education james arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is being considered at this time because the health care students were unable to continue on with their courses
once i m able to answer your question and how the program is going to be designed and what the decision is about going ahead for this program i ll be able to answer that
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr kattuk
question 47 - 1 2
rehabilitation programs for inmates
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister of justice mr anawak
at the baffin correctional centre here in iqaluit i think that the department of justice refers to it as a warehouse where you put away people
the people who are inmates of that facility are not provided with any rehabilitative programs
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes thank you
we don t want to put our people away to warehouses especially our people
i have had meetings with the officials in the department of justice specifically in the area of correctional facilities including the one in iqaluit and the ycc in yellowknife
that s exactly what we want to do
we want to establish facilities that are more directed to the lifestyles of the geographical area that they come from
for example we re looking at young people who may be able to take programs where they can go on an out on the land training program
we are looking at these current programs in preparation to return them to local communities

my question is to the minister responsible for health mr picco
thank you
speaker
two questions for mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
what we spoke about in the committee and what we said subsequently was that under the department of health we want to put an organizational plan in place
the contract for that work to be developed over the next several weeks will be in conjunction with the department of education
i am not aware that the contract has been let - right now per se and indeed i don t know if you re allowed to actually table for example a contract to an individual whatever
the terms of reference of the contract once put in place i could commit to table that in the house if that s what the member s requesting
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
second question mr o brien
mr o brien

mr speaker i was under the impression that the contract was actually let and that the person was in place
just for clarification purposes is the minister saying that is not the case
speaker
thank you mr o brien

ajauqtiit review of draft business plans and preliminary budget information 1999/2000 main estimates
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to review the introduction and general recommendations from the standing committee of ajauqtiit
mr speaker members of ajauqtiit reviewed the draft business plan and preliminary budget information for the legislative assembly on tuesday april 27th 1999
however in this meeting the speaker in effect appeared as a minister and the clerk as a deputy minister and the members asked questions as they would of any other minister or department official
a total budget allocation for operations of the legislative assembly of nunavut is 9 million 748 thousand
in general recommendations as with other standing committees members experienced some frustration in reviewing financial print outs that were initially provided only in english
members thank the office of the legislative assembly for preparing an inuktitut more user friendly format and providing it to the members after the meeting
however in light of difficulties effecting all committees members passed the following motion
that all materials or correspondence provided by the government of nunavut departments or ministers to the members of the legislative assembly should be done in both english and inuktitut
that sufficient resources be allocated for translation services to ensure that this happens on a timely basis
mr speaker that concludes my introductory comments
i move seconded by the member from hudson bay that the report be referred to committee of the whole for consideration in concurrence with the 1999/2000 main estimates
i further seek unanimous consent to waive rule 91-4 to move the report into committee of the whole for today
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation

mr tootoo is seeking unanimous consent to waive rule 91 4 that the committee report be tabled at the committee of the whole

report 4 - 1 2
culture education & health review of draft business plans and preliminary information on the 1999/2000 main estimates
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will be reading the report on the review of draft business plans of the standing committee on culture education and health
it has seven pages
standing committee on culture education and health
review departmental performance and consider any other matter referred by the house
the standing committee has oversight responsibility for the following the department of health and social services department of education department of culture language elders and youth
introduction at the point of the standing committees review in april of 1999 the government of nunavut was only three weeks old
nevertheless in spite of it s youth the government has had to make plans and move forward quickly with the budget for the new fiscal year
much of this preparatory work was done by departments prior to march 31/99 under the leadership of the office of the interim commissioner
presentations were made by the ministers and their departmental officials to the standing committee which included draft business plans mostly developed prior to february 5th 1999
draft capital plans mostly commitments by gnwt prior to march 31 1999 and one-page budgets or main estimate summaries
members also had the opportunity to ask questions to obtain further details and some departments provided additional information following the hearings
as this is the first time that the standing committees have performed this review function members have some questions and recommendations about the process for all three departments
general recommendations to all departments the need for detailed and realistic plans and long term goals
the standing committee is concerned with setting up expectations that may not be met due to limitations in our financial or human resources
at the same time the standing committee appreciated the efforts of the departments which outlined longer term strategic goals and objectives even up to twenty years
footprints it is unclear from the presentations to the standing committee what directions the departments have received regarding the recommendations that are in the footprints documents prepared by the nunavut implementation commission
there appears to be some inconsistency as the departments are fulfilling some footprints recommendations but not fulfilling others
is there a list of principles or criteria by which departments are making decisions
recommendation
that the government of nunavut generally implement the recommendations of footprints unless there are good reasons for pursuing an alternate course of action and these reasons are publicly outlined
decentralization
footprints recommended a decentralized government
the office of the interim commissioner reviewed these recommendations and in october 1998 made a public commitment for a number of decentralized positions under different departments to go to specific communities
it is unclear from the presentations to the standing committees as to what the plans are for these decentralized positions
which communities will have which positions and what is the expected time frame for these positions to be established
furthermore how will the services that have been contracted back to the gnwt be integrated into the decentralization plan
recommendation
that the government of nunavut departments provide the standing committee with detailed plans regarding the decentralization by community by position and with time frames
where the departments are proposing to take an alternate course of action than in footprints or to the 1998 public statement on decentralized positions a review of alternative options and compelling reasons should be provided to the standing committee
inuit qaujimanituqangit
all departments stated a commitment to making inuit qaujimanituqangit a cornerstone of the new government and under the office of the interim commissioner this was a component of both division and the goals of governance of the new government
however it was disappointing that no department presented a clear articulation of what this means
as noted below the standing committee embraces the involvement of the communities and elders in policy development and program delivery as two components ensuring a culturally sensitive government built on inuit traditions and inuit ways of doing things
members also welcome the commitment by the cabinet to making inuktitut the working language of the cabinet and the government and various initiatives proposed for the departments to increase the capacity of the staff to speak and understand inuktitut
members do not want the government of nunavut to take that risk
members welcome this beginning and encourage a collective effort to build on it
recommendation
that the cabinet build a strong policy statement about their commitment to inuit qaujimanituqangit as the foundation of the government of nunavut
community input and support
as noted above all departments spoke of their commitment in making inuit qaujimanituqangit a foundation of their work however there are very few details as to how this will happen
the standing committee welcomes the stated commitments to work with our communities
members of the standing committees believe that if the departments truly utilize the communities needs first in making decisions about policy or programs that they will be utilizing the community heritage as well as traditional knowledge
however even when the departments give an example of community bodies and organizations that they wish to work with in the future few details were provided as to how this would happen
the standing committee notes that the gnwt government had a stated commitment to community empowerment and in the past they negotiated the transfer of responsibilities to some communities in nunavut
this support should provide the appropriate co-ordination and administrative support physical facility support and compensation for the elders work it seems clear that the department of culture language elders & youth does not have enough funding for this task
as well they should support women elders by using the status of women funding these are but to name a few
that the departments develop detailed plans for integrating elders in policy development and program delivery within their mandate sharing of information in the budget review process
that the departments should provide mid-year progress reports that would be reviewed by the standing committee in october of this year 1999
they should include detailing the programs which have been initiated to date they should outline specific expenditures to date and entitlements and providing information on plans for the remaining fiscal year

this department is a central agency which provides a wide range of services to the entire government in areas such as recruitment training and development job evaluation and labour relations
there was no equivalent department in the previous government prior to the division
the department of human resources has a close relationship with the department of finance and administration which manages the payroll system and participates in collective bargaining
the centralized approach to the delivery of human resource programs reflects the fact that the nunavut government is a relatively small organization the 99/2000 budget for the department of human resources is just over 10 million dollars
the largest component of the budget is removals to and from the community of employment and recruitment at about 6 3 million dollars
the remainder of the budget is divided amongst the directorate policy and planning staffing policy and an assistant deputy ministers division which includes regional offices labour relations training and development and job evaluation/organizational design
the department has no capital funding in its budget
to carry out the activities of the department we currently have in place seventeen employees at headquarters and four in the regions
i am pleased to tell you that 68% of the staff are inuit
hiring for the baffin regional office in igloolik will not take place until office space and staff housing are available
current plans call for infrastructure to be available in 2000
the regional human resource services will be handled out of head quarters operation until then
the departments first priority is staffing up its own operation and providing centralized recruiting services to other departments who are doing the same thing
the biggest challenge we will face over the coming years is the renewal of the collective agreements
the two unions the federation of nunavut teachers and the nunavut employees union have both served notice to commence negotiations
finally i expect the department to be a positive force in promoting a stable and representative work force that reflects the values and the vision of our government
mr chairman i would be happy to answer any questions that the members may have
thank you
chairperson interpretation

the main estimates summary provided to the committee indicated a total of 1999/2000 expenditures of $10 835 523 00
the committee again recognizes the central agency function of the department and has the following brief comments and observations
on competency based human resource systems the departments draft business plan stresses the need to remove artificial academic requirements in its job evaluation system
the competency-based system is intended to help achieve the inuit employment plan of the government
the committee is supportive of efforts designed to maximize inuit employment in government and looks forward to regular updates in government wide progress in that area
the committee looks forward to receiving information on progress in this area
in regards to labour relations the committee was informed that the department has not yet staffed the position of director of labour relations
the committee was advised that when the position is staffed the department will be able to start developing a strategy in this area

the committee was advised that departments are currently in the process of having their organizational charts receive final approval

any questions or comments o brien
thank you mr chairman
i don t have any general comments but i do have a i guess a general question mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr ng do you have a response please
hon kelvin ng
yes thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the government of nunavut the cabinet hasn t tasked any specific minister or any department right now with the lead on the whole decentralization issue
it is within the prerogative of the premier right now and executive right now by the mere fact that it has not been passed on to anybody specifically
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien i have a hard time remembering your name but go ahead
mr o brien
it is okay mr chairman you can call me what ever you feel is appropriate
i have been called many names
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien your response mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman obviously we have a critical role in respect of supporting the departments wherever they may be in recruiting for their positions
that is the centralized support that this department provides and also in respect to holding the benefits of the relocation of the new employees and the development of staffing
so those are the key areas
the provision of being involved in the acquisition of the staff housing as well
those responsibilities lie within this department
that is the critical support that we will provide to for the decentralization of government positions
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr o brien
in reference to training for decentralized jobs
what is the status on your training plan
chairperson interpretation
mr minister would you respond to that
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
i am told that right now through the involvement of the nuhrds strategy that there are forty two individuals who are funded under that program or within our system
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien go ahead
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
hon kelvin ng thank you mr chairman that may well be why the premier hasn t assigned maybe he feels because it is broader and the importance of the issue that he is holding it himself
we haven t got into that debate yet and obviously everybody recognizes the importance of the issue so i will certainly relay that back to him
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister and mr o brien
at this time mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
my name is not pokniknak it is puqiqnak
mr chairman thank you
the minister stated this morning that there would be a liquor outlet in uqsuqtuq and there was a comment made that we would not want to be a liquor outlet based in uqsuqtuq
looking at the employment looking at how employment effects the community i would like you to clarify whether this liquor warehouse is going to be based where this liquor warehouse is going to be based
whether it is if they don t want it in uqsuqtuq which other communities are you looking at
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
the minister would like to answer that question hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman mr chairperson i may have erred earlier in my answer to my question
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr puqiqnak i believe you have another question
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
that s the understanding that i got from reading the report
i would like everyone out there to understand that
it is not going to be the liquor warehouse that is going to base there it is the liquor licensing board that would be there
we have been getting the proper information out to our community in that regard
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
at this time we are not we are on the issue of human resources
let us stick to the item we are not talking about the liquor licensing board here
that is for your information
mr puqiqnak do you have another comment to make
mr puqiqnak interpretation
well i am not trying to talk about liquor or liquor licensing board i just wanted to get the proper information out there so that there is not any misunderstanding i just wanted to make that clarification
i just wanted to get the people the proper information
chairperson interpretation well you could have got that information out in a brief comment because of course when you start debating you tend to spend a long time
ok any comments
irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
my friend down there at the witness table
i did pose a question earlier but i would like to ask again because in his opening comments he said that the baffin regional office in igloolik will not take place until office space and houses are available
when i posed my question earlier you didn t give any direct response but my question was whether this could have taken place on april 1 with the creation of nunavut
with the relocation dollars for staff what is going to be happening now with that money that was earmarked for our relocating staff to igloolik
chairperson interpretation
thank you
we talked about that this morning
regarding the igloolik school mr minister if you would respond to that question
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
we couldn t have had it up and running on april 1 because there wasn t a department in the gnwt so there was no positions established for april 1
thank you
chairperson interpretation
i believe mr irqittuq has another question
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you
i realize that they re in one pot of money but is it possible to reserve those dollars so that they can generate interest
chairperson interpretation
thank you
if you would respond to that question mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman if there were to be a surplus within that expenditure of this department or any other department that would be reassessed at that time to see where other needs may develop
as it stands now that is the allocation that is within the budget and until we get into operations we won t know if it is sufficient or insufficient
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr irqittuq any further questions
thank you for your response mr minister
any other items
maybe later
thank you mr irqittuq for forgetting your question
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
in regards to human resources i would like to make a comment
the larger communities will of course have employment positions and there are the smaller communities that have been asking for employment positions
i think we have a tendency to forget about the smaller communities and dollars are not allocated for the smaller communities
what kind of plan do you have so that the smaller communities like pelly bay or repulse bay are included in these decentralization plans
i would like clarification on this point
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr minister your response please
hon kelvin ng
well mr chairperson i don t know if i can respond to that question
it is not because i don t want to it is because of the fact that this government is working with the decentralization plan that the nunavut implementation commission proposed and it was modified through the interim commissioners office
we know that it didn t take into account every single community it tried to focus on establishing functional government offices in several locations
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
i don t believe that s a question
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
first of all i would like to ask about those communities that were going to get decentralized positions
their infrastructure has been built already but some of the building materials have still not been getting into the communities
will they be going into the communities this year on sealift
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson as i think i answered to mr nutarak on nunavut construction
they re responsible with the federal government for developing housing and staff office space for the decentralized model and at the same time we ll probably ask for an update on the overall timetable for finishing those facilities and that infrastructure
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr akesuk i think you have another question
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr minister you want to respond
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
yes that goes back to the whole basis of the decentralized discussion that took place earlier today and over the past
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
do you have another question mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
mr minister the communities will have to receive those decentralized py s and they are going to need office space and staff housing and we want to see more positions decentralized from the government
i wonder if there has been additional training provided to those people who are slated to be moved to the communities
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr ng if you wish to respond to that
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
i believe that i indicated earlier that under the nunavut unified human resource development strategy which everyone call nuhrds there are several programs that have been funded under that to develop inuit training and career advancement
there is public service career training programs nunavut senior assignment program executive master of business administration program executive secretarial training there s been media communications training and there has also been the nunavut government student employment
so there are various programs that have been funded to try and bring up the level of experience and skills overall throughout nunavut
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
i think those are all the questions you have
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairperson
i don t know if this is your department or not so correct me if it isn t
a two bedroom apartment they get for i think the figure is 1200 dollars a month and the utilities are paid for
in a place like baker lake and arviat possibly rankin inlet you can check that it s different too
there was leases signed in the previous government that had to come over according to the nunavut act
so you have people in rankin inlet in private accommodations that are paying 2 thousand to 2 500 dollars a month for accommodations
is the minister committed to i don t know if this is his department to making it fair equitable and transparent like we have been told
to make sure that government employees are all treated the same whether they are in iqaluit or pelly bay or baker lake or repulse bay or coral harbour
thank you
chairperson interpretation
minister ng i think you can clarify that question
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman the department of human resources is involved in the allocation of staff housing units and also in the review and development of policies regarding staff housing
the department of public works telecommunications & technical services is involved in the actual leasing portion of that
but yes i am aware of the discrepancies between headquarters and regional staff in some of the regional centres and we are going to try and bring some consistency to the whole issue
it is as you indicated a bit complex there are some units and leases that we have inherited from the gnwt there are others that we inherited from the oic
so there s different factors that have to be taken into consideration
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr mclean you have more questions
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
something that has come up in the last few months and we are a small territory spread out over a vast distance
we talked about this in other matters in regard to conflict of interest and the misunderstandings that people have
my fear is that if we are not very vigilant that direct appointments may come back to haunt us
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr minister would you respond to that
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson cabinet is the only legal mechanism that can appoint individuals directly into positions of this government
so there are certain criteria that have to be met before direct appointments can be made
i don t have that with me here but as it is cabinet and the executive it is probably the premiers responsibility under eia i might be wrong if it is in the hr responsibility i will find out
if it is eia they can provide that information
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr mclean you can go ahead and ask another question
mr mclean
this will be my last one mr chairman for now
thank you
thank you
chairperson interpretation thank you mr mclean
mr ng do you have a comment to make to that
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
you meant for all of the departments of government i take it
yes
we will see what we can provide in a summary form
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr tootoo iqaluit centre you have the floor
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
just a few questions to follow up on mr mclean about the organizational chart
have all departments have finalized organizational charts at this time
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
i am told we don t have all of them in yet from all of the departments
thank you
chairperson interpretation
go ahead mr tootoo you have another question
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i m not sure if the minister understood i wasn t asking if he had received them i was asking if all departments had finalized approved organizational charts for each of their departments
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
i think mr minister you can provide a better response to that
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson it is probably more appropriate when they come up about their specific organizational chart
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo you can continue
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
the minister indicated in his opening remarks that they have 17 employees in headquarters and four in the regions
does he have an organizational chart for his department that has been finalized and if so out of that 17 or those 21 positions at what levels are they staffed at right now
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
i would just like to say at this point that we are conducting our affairs in inuktitut so if i say boss or president i am struggling with minister so if i say boss or president i mean minister
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you i like boss
anyway yes we have an approved org chart with 47 positions and 17 filled out of 47
thank you
chairperson interpretation
you have another one mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i have a number more but one more on this topic is does the minister have an idea of a time frame in which his department will be staffed to its full capacity
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister boss ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
i can t say for sure i mean obviously there is a priority right now because we are one of the departments that provides the human resource support for the other departments
so cabinet has recognized it as a priority in trying to get this as one of the departments to try and get staffed up first and we are trying to do that
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you boss ng
i also want you to know when i say minister i am trying to speak english
i think irqittuq you wanted to ask another question
go ahead
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
the minister at the witness table i have some more questions to ask of him
will they need to have the same qualifications as the ones hired in iqaluit or has there been some consideration given to experience or equivalencies
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq your question is in order
minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman it was raised earlier and our goal is to staff as many positions as possibly based on competency on being able to do the job not so much on the technical qualifications of those individuals
that is where the department is moving the whole government of nunavut so your evaluation is based more on being able to do the job more than your technical background
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
i think you have another question mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
the jobs which will be advertised and so no matter where the jobs are will you be looking at the residents first before hiring outside of the community
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister ng did you want to respond to that
hon kelvin ng
yes mr chairperson
yes most definitely if the positions can be filled locally that would be the first priority
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
are there any other comments or questions under human resources while the minister is at the witness table
mr mclean go ahead i apologize mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman my question is in relationship to pay equity
i am just wondering if the minister can give us an update as to where this issue stands in relation to implementing a gender neutral job evaluation system for the new nunavut government
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister ng you may respond please
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman the collective agreement that was reached by the gnwt with their employees which transferred over to the nunavut government and the nunavut based employees was a gender neutral classification it took that into account
so all the positions that were transferred to nunavut after division came over with the new job evaluation method and the new hay plan as well
in addition to that the newly created positions for headquarters whether it is in iqaluit we are all being evaluated using that plan as well
so it is all gender neutral
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien further comments
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
are things kosher are we anticipating any problems with this system that we have inherited
chairperson interpretation
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
it is our understanding that at this point in time there are not problems with the new job evaluation system
i believe there is some mechanism for an appeal system for those individuals who feel that they were not properly categorized within certain pay ranges
but generally broadly across the board most of the problems are gone we feel
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien would you like to ask another question
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson my final question is in reference to the affirmative action policy
if you could give the members a brief update as to where this issue stands with your department chairperson interpretation
minister ng either you or one of your officials could respond ms aglukkaaq
thank you mr chairperson the affirmative action policy was transferred over to the government of nunavut
there were minor revisions to it and we have incorporated the article 23 inuit beneficiary preference as priority one under the policy
so any recruitment plans that we have in place individuals are required to identify whether they are beneficiaries of the claim or not to be considered into any positions
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you very much mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you
any other questions or comments to the department of human resources
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
my question relates to an issue that was mentioned earlier
i was wondering if the minister could advise as to how many positions that the government has staffed through the open competition process and how many have been staffed via the direct appointment process
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng or one of your officials can reply
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i don t know the total numbers that had been staffed i can tell you that there s only been two direct appointment made by this cabinet
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo would you like to make another comment
m tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i wonder if the minister would advise us of the circumstances that allowed the department to hire or fill those positions without using the open competition process and advertising those positions to all the people of nunavut
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
yes because those two individuals completed their management training program with arctic college and had a specific interest actually in the department of finance that s why i know those two individuals
thank you
if i may add those two positions are targeted for decentralization to one of the communities when they complete their training as will thank you
chairperson
interpretation
mr tootoo you may go ahead and ask your question
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
another issue that was raised earlier in regards to the last question about affirmative action
how does the department rate their someone that is a long term resident that may not be a beneficiary of nunavut but was born here and lived here all their lives
will those individuals still receive preferential treatment under the affirmative action program
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman on the affirmative action policy they would be designated priority through category
thank you
chairperson
interpretation
thank you mr ng
questions or comments mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
i was listening to mr tootoo through translation but it s okay
in regards to human resources when we discuss this matter i just remembered that we ve been thinking about the article 23
after the nunavut government had been established we have to utilize and do our business according to article 23
we ve heard much that after the nunavut government was established we now have to do things according to the article 24 and we should be prioritising or we should be contracting people from within nunavut
it seems quite embarrassing although we had worked very hard but it s quite embarrassing because we are not utilizing the article 23
we have to do something according to article 23 and 24 because we have to abide by those articles
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
right now i want the members to be aware that i am now using clyde river dialect
mr ng you may respond now
in regards to your question seems like your question should be directed to the minister of health and social services
mr ng you could respond to it if you d like
hon kelvin ng
minister i ll let them
when his budget comes up it s probably more appropriate
>>applause
chairperson interpretation
mr puqiqnak i think he answered your questions do you have any further comments
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank your mr chairman in regards to human resources i thought we were dealing with human resources
as nunavut residents should have employment opportunities and we should also be contracting nunavut residents
i feel that nunavut should be contracting that boarding home from within nunavut but in regards to the minister of health i know the minister for that department but i was trying to talk more in line of employment
i wanted to ask you a question because we would like to do things according to article 23
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
department of human resources minister ng would you like to respond
thank you
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the member makes a good point but the department of human resources is responsible for hiring for the government departments and providing training opportunities for the residents of nunavut and particularly employees as well
i think that members questions are better probably raised when public works telecommunications comes up in respect of contracting provisions of article 24
when the department of health and social services boards comes up in respect to that same provision with the contracts that were let by the board
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
the clock is ticking and we ve got a few issues to cover mr akesuk

thank you mr ng
mr tootoo your questions
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
in regards to staff housing policy and the allocations of staff housing units under the previous government that was a responsibility for the financial management board that contracted to the nwt housing corporation
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
interpretation
thank you mr tootoo mr ng or aglukkaq
ms aglukkaq
qujannamiik itsivautaa
it differs between regions
in kitikmeot there s a committee that allocates the units for government units and that s with human resources financial management board public works
in the keewatin it s a combination and there s also been contracts to maintain the units outside of government
in the baffin i believe with housing corporation that arrangement to maintain the government inventory of units was contracted to the housing authority
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
interpretation
thank you ms aglukkaaq
mr tootoo do you have any other questions
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i am aware of that process and how it works and i was just more or less wondering now is that still in place or is there a different method of allocating and who s responsible now
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng or ms aglukkaaq
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i believe that i indicated that the allocations policy all those procedures carried over after april 1st and we haven t changed to date but it is subject to review right now

mr ng or ms aglukkak
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman there s two different processes
the two different processes from what i am understand are a regional allocation committee and a headquarters allocation committee
that s where some of the differences might be coming into play
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr minister i think it does explain this as you said earlier that the same process was being followed
there was only one committee that was allocating units prior to april 1st and now it appears as you mentioned you have two separate committees allocating units
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
i don t think your looking at any other response now mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman well before april 1st my understanding is the oic had an allocation committee and gnwt had a regional allocation committee
so after april 1st that s where you end up with the two committees
i mean those are the kind of things that we re trying to streamline in the development of a new government of nunavut policy in relation to staff housing thank you
chairperson
interpretation
thank you mr ng
is that end of your time mr tootoo
thank you mr tootoo any further comments or questions
go back to line by line these have to be passed 4 - 4 under human resource chart and this is the directorate for the 1999/2000 operations and maintenance budget
i believe you re looking at the page 4 - 4 operations and maintenance
the total operations and maintenance budget
again i read this as $ 687 00 i believe this is $ 687 thousand dollars are there any comments to the amounts
all the members have agreed thank you
capital items total capital nothing so the total expenditures for the directorate is $ 687 for those in agreement
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
i just want to ask mr chairman the minister made a short comment as he was doing his introductory statements that the human resources he stated that there were no capital purchases in the total human resources portfolio
should we even mention capital when there s no purchases or no budget for capital items
chairperson interpretation
are you following the same book
i ve been told that although there is no amount in these slots we still have to refer to them because again that s part of the government protocol
the total expenditures for the directorate is 687 thousand dollars you agree 4 - 5 policy and planning operations and maintenance budget in total is $ 116 thousand dollars not much agreed
for total capital the total expenditures and there is no total capital so therefore the total expenditures for policy and planning is $ 116 thousand are you agreed good
are you agreed you guys agreed before you even ask for the agreement
thank you
4 - 7 assistant deputy minister operations and maintenance total operation and maintenance 3 million 780 thousand
are you agreed mr tootoo did you make a comment to this item

arviat p3 project
hon hon kelvin ng
mr speaker i am very pleased to announce that the government of nunavut has signed a public-private partnership agreement with the arviat development corporation for the health facility in arviat
this is the first p3 project agreement in nunavut and the northwest territories
public-private partnerships are a financing alternative in which the government partners with a private sector business to provide some of the government s infrastructure needs
the private business invests in the project and then enters into an operating lease with the government
in today s dollars this project is worth approximately ten 10 million dollars
mr speaker i would like to thank the adc and their representatives who are in the gallery today for their co-operation and support in moving the process forward and ensuring that the agreement met the interests of the community
mr guy alikut ms cleo prellwitz and mr joe manik
they deserve great credit in bringing this much needed health centre to arviat
it is expected that the design work for the health centre will be completed by the end of may with the construction schedule to begin early this fall
this agreement is significant because it lays the foundation for future p3 projects in nunavut
it was important that the standards were high the gn received good value the agreement would meet the auditor general s guidelines for an operating lease and that the interests of the community were best served
we believe that all of this has been achieved in this agreement

hon hon ed picco interpretation
thank you mr speaker english i want to take this opportunity to reinforce the earlier comments made by minister ng
this agreement officially launches the work on a new health centre in arviat which should be ready early in the year 20000
this is an important project and has been one of my department s highest priorities
it is the first of four health facilities on the government s list of possible p3 projects and i look forward to seeing progress made on those projects in the near future

cbc and consensus government
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
listening to the c b c this morning i understand that the media have started to refer to members on this side of the house as nunavut s opposition
a pretty snap decision considering that this is only our sixth day in this session
it took god a full week to create the world
i guess the media needs less time to define this assembly
>>applause
hear hear
the term opposition suggests discord for the sake of appearing different attacking to score cheap political points
mr speaker the regular members of the assembly have made very clear their desire to work with the government to make nunavut a better place for all
to be consulted and to have input on the issues facing us all
it s simply not correct to suggest that we have something to gain by acting as knee jerk opposition to anything the government says or does
that s not opposition mr speaker that s accountability
there is a big difference
thank you

need for school buses in iqaluit
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise to make a statement on the issue of school busing here in iqaluit
as the members are aware the population of iqaluit is increasing as more and more public servants are moving to iqaluit
they move to iqaluit with their families
mr speaker next year the new middle school will open at the top of the hill but the two elementary schools will still be bursting at the seams with new students
while the numbers of classrooms is increasing we have to consider the other services for which there will also be an increased demand such as school bussing
mr speaker i want to make the point that these are examples of forced growth
the money allocated for services such as school bussing has to keep up with the demand due to more students
to give members a sense of the problem one bus for the middle school can hold forty four students per trip
currently i believe there are one hundred and seventy seven or one hundred and seventy five students enrolled at the middle school of which one hundred and sixty of them will require bussing
so with one bus to service those students that bus would have to make four trips in the morning eight trips during lunch hour and four trips in the afternoon just to handle the middle school
mr speaker next year there is funding for two busses which is the current level right now two busses and one handicapped bus for the three schools
this is not enough
i know the minister of education shares the concern that the budget must reflect forced growth issues and perhaps his department more than others is impacted by the increasing numbers
in this case the number of students
but communities such as iqaluit and other decentralized communities that will be facing the same problem cannot be expected to absorb the impact of forced growth
the government of nunavut must consider it in their locations of funding communities

yesterday i posed a question in respect to community government the minister of community government

question 51 - 1 2
boarding home contract
mr o brien
mr speaker my question is directed to the minister responsible for health and social services and it involves the recent rewarding of a contract regarding the ublivik centre
thank you mr o brien minister picco
thank you mr speaker
for clarity mr speaker if you would bear with me i would like to give a background on the reason for the r f p and a chronological sequence of events on the r f p
to help answer the question to hopefully put more light on this contract award the keewatin health and social services board has historically contracted with eastgate inuit enterprises to provide boarding home facilities and patient transportation in winnipeg
in december of 1998 the keewatin health and social services board requested a request for proposals in other words an r f p for patient boarding facilities and transportation services in winnipeg
they did this rather than negotiating a contract with the current service provider for the following reasons
the formal contract between the health board and the deliverer of the boarding home services expired in 1995
now since 1995 mr speaker the provision of services has been by a verbal arrangement a verbal arrangement only to operate under the same terms and conditions as outlined in the expired contract
both parties had concerns with the terms and conditions of said verbal arrangements
as well as in 1996/1997 and again in 1998 the board had directed the chief executive officer of the keewatin health and social services board to issue an r f p
following up on this mr speaker an r f p was issued closing at 3 00 p m central standard time march 18 1999
a committee reviewed the proposals in rankin inlet on april 14 1999 and selected t c
enterprises
now mr speaker the board s evaluation team was charged with determining which of the proposals provided the best value
the team had to weigh many factors including the cost to the taxpayers the quality of service to be provided and the implementation of article 24
t c
enterprises satisfied the board evaluation team that it could provide the quality of services of our patients and families at a price the government can afford
mr speaker following up on the second part of the question by mr o brien the contract will take effect on july 1 1999
thank you mr speaker

thank you mr speaker

thank you mr speaker
mr speaker that partly answered my question
i will try to make it a little more clear

thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr o brien
mr picco minister of health and social services
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker no indeed there was other circumstances involving the awarding of the contract as i tried to explain the cost was a mitigating factor but was not the only factor involved in the awarding of the contract
there are several other aspects as i explained earlier in my question there was the benefit to the community article 24 and so on
the cost was not one of the mitigating factors solely there were other factors involved in the review process done by the keewatin regional health and social services board and the people that reviewed the award made in rankin

mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker just a follow up with the member from hudson bay s question to the minister responsible for housing
mr speaker yesterday i tabled documents in the house the interim report from the house of commons standing committee on aboriginal affairs and northern development
the issues it dealt with specifically was a lack the need for better housing in northern isolated communities one of those issues

we have received that report we appreciate the work of this committee because they re working on our behalf
as the nunavut government and my department is responsible for housing we will do everything we can to bring nunavut up to par in terms of the need for housing

thank you mr speaker

thank you mr tootoo
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i m sorry it probably got lost in the translation we re very concerned about people who currently don t have housing and those people who are unable to afford to get their own housing
we re also concerned about future needs for the younger generation and we re also looking at other ways like what they re trying to do in taloyoak they re concentrating on homeownership
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr alakannuark
question 57 - 1 2
high cost of living in nunavut
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
perhaps i will address this question to the minister of transportation
the goods available in nunavut right now are very costly are you looking for ways to cut down the cost of living especially in the area of food
speaker interpretation
hon jack anawak interpretation yes thank you the cost of living housing food clothing and heavier goods that have to be flown to the north are too expensive
the federal government provides subsidies that are worth about $15 million dollars and part of that subsidy goes to nunavut and we had some discussions with diand on how we should be spending the subsidy
because the member is asking about all areas of the cost of living i can only assure the member that we ll be reviewing this further and looking at how more programs can be subsidized
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
second question mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation

mr mclean oral questions
question 58 - 1 2
request for proposals - ublivik contract
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the minister of health regarding the awarding of the ublivik contract
can the minister tell me how many companies had proposals
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr picco minister of health and social services
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i believe there were 4 companies
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question again to the minister
mr minister if the lowest price was not the deciding factor in the awarding of the rfp on the ublivik contract can you please briefly tell me what were the deciding factors on this contract
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker mr speaker cost was one of the factors as explained earlier in the oral question to mr o brien
the rfp was put out by the keewatin regional health and social services board
there are other factors that were looked into and i had mentioned some of them article 24 for an example the quality of service with the proposal itself
i guess it s safe to say that the contract after it was reviewed again by pws with the department of health and social services and justice the contract award seemed to serve the people of nunavut and keewatin region
as well the proposal was sound and i think the fact is that other than prices was the quality of the service of facilities the people involved to deliver the service
the other factors are in rfp which are public knowledge because those were requested in the ad
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
mr minister the company that had the contract provided service to the residents of keewatin for over 20 years was that in any way at all taken into account by whoever awarded this contract
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker if you would like to answer the question i could no no
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i think the government of nunavut the people of nunavut recognize that mrs penner for several years has done a very good job and dedicated herself to taking care of the residents of the keewatin region
i can understand why there would be some disappointment that another contractor has been selected
this is done through an rfp as i explained i went through the process which the keewatin health and social services board undertook which they did thoroughly and fairly and i m confident of that proposal
so i understand the experience and the dedication of mrs penner
i think it s just when the rfp came forward the criteria was set out and everyone was on an equal footing
the keewatin regional health and social services board picked the contractor that the final contract was awarded to based on the criteria that was in place
it was a fair sound process and i understand there would be disappointment from the person who had run the contract for several years
as i explained earlier the contract was holdover since 1995 it was a verbal commitment
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
mr o brien
mr o brien

can the minister tell me who finally signed off this contract

question 62 - 1 2
sanikiluaq interpreters for assembly
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i wanted to ask the minister of culture language elders & youth mr havioyak
the first year that we were here
perhaps i should make a comment first
i don t want to lose my own dialect or my language and to make everybody understand what i am saying i will be using a dialect that is not my own
i value my own dialect
i spoke to the minister earlier this year that perhaps we should hire an interpreter from sanikiluaq once in a while
i am going to have to borrow dialects to be understood here i know that if i used my own dialect that minister would not understand what i am trying to say
i wonder if you have been told about that before that we need to have the sanikiluaq dialect interpreted here at the house
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you
this is one of the responsibilities of the legislative assembly so i will have a talk with the clerk of the legislative assembly about that
oral questions
mr mclean
question 63 - 1 2
status of positions with education boards
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the minister of education mr arvaluk
in regards to the phasing out of the education boards and the news release the boards will be phased out during the next year and no jobs are expected
mr minister could you please give me details where the 12 people employed in the board office in baker lake will be employed next year
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes the policy objective which we achieved through the cabinet is a no lay-off policy
if a divisional board office is in baker lake then the employees will be in baker lake
there is no plan for kitikmeot and kivalliq to move there headquarters regional offices somewhere else only in the baffin is the regional office to be relocated to pangnirtung
everywhere else we have no plans to relocate the staff if the relocation isn t necessary
however i would like to add for the member that because of the divisional boards elimination plan we will probably require less administration and financial personnel
the premier has indicated that as soon as possible we will start placing some of these unnecessary positions after july 1 2000 we will start placing them immediately elsewhere within the government
that may not be required after july 1 2000
in this case if you have excess in the area of administration and finance sections of the divisional boards in baker lake then they will be invited to seek similar positions within the nunavut government
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question again for the minister
could the minister give me a time line as to when these employees can be advised of their options
they are all long term residents of baker lake and have families and mortgages to deal with
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr speaker we are in the process i hope sometime this week or next week i will be able to announce the implementation co-ordinator
as soon as we get those organized hopefully within a month we will be able to advise the staff as to the most suitable or best way to deal with it
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
mr o brien
question 64 - 1 2
vacant decentralization infrastructure
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question concerns decentralization
since we don t have a minister in charge of decentralization i will pose my question to the minister of public works telecommunications & technical services
mr speaker we spent millions and millions of dollars in some of our communities constructing office buildings and accommodations
in some cases houses have been completed and boarded up for the winter
these buildings have been heated but empty
we have a number of people i believe there are seven people at least that have been hired and waiting to take up office accommodations unfortunately the building s not available
we are also told that there are no phones available northwestel is not able to hook the phones up until august
my question mr speaker is when can we expect to get some solid confirmation as to when these buildings can be used so we can get on with the business of decentralization and running this government
speaker interpretation
minister thompson
hon manitok thompson
this is a question to the finance minister
my department is on track with the buildings we are just a service department so i will refer that question to the finance minister who is more involved in the decentralized model of the government
thank you
speaker
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker and i thank my colleague for referring the question to me
i think in yesterday s committee debates on the departments of finance & administration and human resources that issue came up
several members had questioned the timing and availability of staff housing and office space in their communities to accommodate some of these decentralized positions
i understand that some assets are in the stage right now of being transferred to the government of nunavut
but it is my understanding that as of today that we don t have any of those units within our jurisdiction but it is in process
thank you
speaker
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it is my understanding and again i am not sure but some of these units are actually turned over
so i would ask the minister if he could give me a firmer time line as i have said we have staff that have been hired
we have people that are waiting to move in they don t have accommodations
so if you could at least give me a date when i could tell these people back home when they could move into these accommodations that we may be paying for even as we speak
so if you could give me some date that i could bring back home to the people
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as i said i don t know i don t have the specific details here
possibly the deputy minister of public works telecommunications & technical services who was involved in the lease negotiations may have more specific detailed information
if he doesn t i will certainly make a point of finding out as soon as possible
thank you speaker
mr o brien mr o brien
one last point mr speaker
in reference to the concern over phone systems i would hope that is not the case where we would have to wait for northwestel until august to hook up the phone systems in our office complex
this is more a comment if the minister could look into that to see if it could be corrected
thank you
speaker
mr ng
mr o brien a comment when you are asking oral questions you have to make sure you are asking the same question you are changing the question now thank you
question 65 - 1 2
disease prevention incidence of illness
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister of health & social services
the communities see a lot more illness nowadays in their communities
what can be done in nunavut for the prevention of serious illness
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
minister of health & social services mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
i wonder if the member could rephrase his question
speaker
mr picco please listen
this is a question for the minister of health
mr alakannuark could you please clarify your question
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is for the minister of health
more and more people are getting serious illnesses in communities
maybe the problems are caused by food contamination in the food chain or from the environment
would it be possible to monitor the reasons why more people are getting sick in the communities
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
minster of health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker over the past several weeks now we have heard for example the first instances of diabetes are being seen more prevalently
one of the factors that the medical people are telling us is that with the changing patterns and lifestyles of the people of nunavut indeed one main factor would be the diets
as an example as we have gotten away from eating more country foods and we are now eating more processed foods we seem to have more instances of heart problems diabetes as i earlier said
indeed the rates of cancer have increased
right now in nunavut under the department of health we really don t have the capacity to track individual diseases and so forth we are actually contracting back some of these service
the department of health has been monitoring through the regional health boards the different instances and rates of the different diseases
one of the factors for the changing patterns of health and the new instances of different diseases has been the changes in lifestyle and the changes in consumption of food products as one example

hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i will do my opening comments for the public works and after i do my comments i ll go down to the witness chair with my officials
thank you mr chairman for the opportunity to make some introductory remarks on the business plan as it relates to the budget for the department of public works telecommunications and technical services
this covers the time period of 1999 and 2000
the main estimates for the department are divided as follows
$67 1 million for o & m
$5 7 million for capital
although there are a number of headquarter positions that remain to be filled the department has well established regional offices in baffin keewatin and kitikmeot regions
out of the 108 positions in the regional operations in the larger communities a total of 40 are staffed by inuit
this represents 37% of the workforce in the department
all regional public works telecommunications and technical services offices are ensuring that services are being provided without interruption while the headquarters positions are bring staffed
the services provided are purchasing and contracting
building maintenance and the delivery of petroleum products
the department is contracting services from the department of public works and services gnwt
this will fill the gap in skills until they are developed in nunavut
the decentralization plan for the department is proceeding
this is scheduled to begin in the year 2000 as additional housing and office space becomes available
there are now a total of 46 housing units and 3 office buildings completed
these are located in communities in all three regions where regional offices will be located
the department also manages the petroleum products revolving fund
this fund i strictly for the financing of fuel inventory and operating expenses and is recovered through the pricing structure
public works also manages a large budget on behalf of client departments who are constructing buildings as part of their capital plan
the department provides a high degree of services in order to ensure the necessary requirements are met
the department also intends to review the standards and criteria used to determine capital expenditures
the intent will be to designing criteria that meet the specific needs of nunavut
all interested parties will be contracted for input including the mlas through the standing committees
current criteria were carried over from the gnwt in order to ensure that some standards were in place until a review
central purchasing is also a major task handled by the department
this represents a significant opportunity for nunavuts businesses to develop and grow
the department ensures contracts and purchases meet all the requirements of article 24 of the nunavut land claims agreement in addition to the government s purchasing regulations
a review will be undertaken with nti to ensure that the policies meet the needs of nunavut and article 24
one of the largest divisions in the department is petroleum products
petroleum products is responsible for providing fuels to the communities of nunavut
the fuel is distributed by local contractors employing local people
this division has annual revenues of over 1 4 million dollars
fuel is supplied by ships or barges during the resupply period in the summer time
there is currently a contract in place with ntcl to supply this fuel until the end of year 2001
this will provide time to allow a review of the options available to lower costs
this will be done in conjunction with a review of the eastern arctic sealift which is co-ordinated by the coast guard until the year 2000
there are no problems being anticipated at this time
i hope these comments have been informative and i hope that i have been clear
so i am ready to go down to the witness chair

my question is is there any relationship or co-ordination between your department and minister and the department of education in reference to the information highway
chairperson interpretation
which of you will provide a response to that
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
not being fully briefed on all the details of this department we ve been very busy with our priorities i m sorry to say that but our priority is to serve the communities the best we can
i ll let mr mrazek add on to what i ve said
i m pretty sure that we will also service the small communities with the department of education if we have to but i ll let mr mrazek elaborate more on that
thank you
mr mrazek
with that i think we will put a little bit of light into it so member from arviat will get hopefully little bit clear picture
eventually all communities will be connected through the server and the main network
we have just completed meetings last week with northwesttel and we tried to resolve a number of the telecommunication issues between government between the northwesttel between the ardicom and few other suppliers
this thing is really a complex project
i m sorry i m not able to give you a specific date but we have the three major communities operational
we will be hooking up the arviat within the next several weeks and so is kugluktuk which will be operational and other community will follow
this progress it s extremely complex
it takes a very lots of energy manpower and it s basically going every two weeks and there are very serious meetings and progress check outs
i m sorry i cannot give you anymore specific dates but it s definitely nothing more original than to have all the communities connected in all through the intercom
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mrazek
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
thank you for that response mr mrazek
so the people back in my home community will be pleased to hear that we hope not for the next few weeks
my next question is in reference to some clarification on the bip the business incentive policy
in article 24 do we have anything in place at this point to say that the b i p will be in place prior to the summer projects being started or concluded
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
i hope you will be able to understand that because they will be translated to english for sure
perhaps mr mrazek will speak to this point a little further so he can clarify the situation
sometimes when it goes through the translator it kind of loses the meaning
chairperson interpretation
do you wish to add on to this mr mrazek
mr mrazek
i would like to add just a few notes for the benefit of everybody
the business incentive policy has been approved last week and it s interim measure for one year and what s happened basically is that the business and companies will get preference only within the nunavut territory
this way they benefit the companies and definitely benefit from that location
and nti as the interim measure mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr mrazek for that information
i wonder if the minister and her staff can speak briefly to their current thinking on sealift options
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
mr o brien
i couldn t hear that my headset could she repeat that
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr chairman thank you mr o brien
can you please rephrase your question and ask make it as understandable as to what you wish to make it understandable what you wish spoken to what you are alluding to can you clarify that please
mr o brien
in reference to sealift
have they reviewed sealift as it is
do they anticipate any changes as far as usage schedules and so on is there any we re thinking of existing sealift operations
chairperson interpretation
thank you
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you very much mr chairperson
we re up to review anything now because we re the new government i guess
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
please proceed
mr mrazek
in case of sealift you probably know that there is still contract with ntcl which government will be using
i believe that contract will expire next year
every region is slightly different rate and to be totally honest with you we didn t spend time and effort due to many other priorities for the last two months and that s basically what is happening right now
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
i m sorry
mr puqiqnak was actually ahead
please proceed
go ahead mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to understand who the suppliers for the petroleum are
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i might be mistaken i seem to know a little bit of it so i would refer that to mr mrazek
chairperson interpretation
go ahead mr mrazek
mr mrazek
petroleum products division tenders the fuel supply every year on the world market
one year you may get gasoline from amsterdam and another year from venezuela saudi arabia and everywhere else
it depends on who will give the government the best possible price for fuel or oil
in the case of the keewatin it is usually through the port of churchill
i hope that answers some of your questions
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
mr chairperson i would like to buy petroleum from saudi arabia because when i smell the petroleum here it s smells better than the gas we have
it has a sweeter smell than the fuel we have
therefore i keep bringing that up
i tend to believe that
i wish to raise a question to you and your staff
your review or research into the petroleum products when will that be completed
perhaps if you found out the reason for the gasoline problems i would like to hear that as soon as possible
again there have been a lot of machines breaking up and if you could find out perhaps the reason for the breakdown of these snowmobiles i would like to find that out
as well i know that this year i was there and the search & rescue division had to go and get people and had to use a lot of gasoline in order to rescue the hunters
even the search & rescue vehicles were breaking down and that was causing a safety concern
what are you going to do about this what are your plans for this problem that we are having in gjoa haven
starting in 1999 in january from then we have been sending letters to the gnwt and it s already been four months
i am sorry i have started to ramble on here but i would like to find out about this
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i understand that he is trying to represent his community and he is doing a good job
again we are the conduits for anything whether it be pleasurable or not because we are representing our community concerns because that is our mandate
he is representing his community i understand his comments properly and he raised a question in respect to the petroleum in gjoa haven
although i understand now and when he posed his question i have kept trying to get a response on this
my staff know exactly what has been happening in gjoa haven as well as the research into the petroleum
this is the one thing that i have understood today the government research into the gasoline they said that it was in acceptable levels
i understand that the hamlet also had an independent researcher look into the make up of the petroleum
i am not sure if this is true but i believe that they said it was acceptable
this is the extent of my understanding on the matter
in respect of the snowmobiles that were breaking down i have heard about it through the radio i heard the mayor alluding to this point
there are a lot of factors involved in skidoo breakdowns this i know however to date the research results have consistently come out saying that it is acceptable
that s all i have at this time but i will be visiting gjoa haven and the residents to meet with them on this petroleum issue
i am sorry that this has been like this for a while and i know that they re very displeased with it
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr puqiqnak perhaps if you have questions other than the petroleum because i know you will be dealing with that and the minister has stated that she will go to the community
do you have any other questions in respect of some other matter for public works
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
if you had a better response then i would prefer to be at the meeting but if you are just bringing the same response then i would prefer not to be at the meeting
if your response is going to continue to be the same then i am not going to be there but if you were to show some new initiative then i would want to be involved
mr chairman i also wanted to emphasize to the minister and her department the gasoline that caused the breakdowns this winter is going to be used again for the summer season
i guess some of the hunters are giving up on their summer travel plans because again they know they might lose their outboard motors if this winter is any indication of the breakdowns of snowmobiles
i am sorry that i keep referring to gasoline and petroleum because again this has caused a lot of stress in our community
especially this winter
again you did not quite respond in respect to i know that you stated that you are not responsible for snowmobiles broken down this winter but what are you going to do about it
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i understand that the member doesn t want to meet tomorrow and i accept that i have other things to do i guess it s okay
i appreciate his comments i don t know if i have any new items in regards to this i am just a new minister
i am sorry to say that i am reviewing what has been going on with the departments
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you ms thompson mr puqiqnak are you done
don t give up just because you get refused once you have to be persistent and that s why you were elected
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i think i should be sitting where you are madame minister i think that i would be perfect for the job
perhaps we should take a break and copies of your opening comments could be made and we would feel much better to deal with the budget estimates madame minister
i do think that i would be good in your position as minister because i know all about the man things like you said before
chairperson interpretation
would you stand up madame minister and mr iqaqrialu will take your place just kidding
let s take a short break to regroup after ms thompson makes a comment
hon manitok thompson interpretation
yes i can do this group and don t patronize me because i am a female because i know that i can work for pwtts thank you
chairperson interpretation
we will regroup and get copies of the opening comments and come back shortly
>>committee recessed at 4 38 pm and resumed at 4 57 pm
chairperson interpretation
thank you please take your seats
we are not supposed to have coffee in the legislature so please ensure that you don t bring your coffee in here
i was told that even in the committee of the whole that was the protocol
the translations are still being carried out and when they are completed they will be handed out
you will be receiving an english copy at this time
again the clock is running and i would like to return to our meeting
mr iqaqrialu i believe mr iqaqrialu has another question we will not be voting on the matter right now
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairperson
in regards to the bip that we just heard about article 24 that we just heard about
this afternoon earlier in question period contracts in regard to rfp s
i am sure that these are awarded to the best proposal and if they have bip and if they have article 24
the problem that i see with rfp s and i have asked the question earlier today to my colleagues is that it is not necessarily the lowest bidder that gets it
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
ms thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i would like to thank the member for his concern
we had talked about that and we have the department working with other departments to see how we can deal with article 24 in the nunavut government in a public government
i will have mr mrazek update us on his discussions in regards to article 24 and bip for contracting in nunavut
mr mrazek will elaborate a little bit more on that
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
i will try to describe the correct answer to mr mclean specifically
there is a major difference between a tender and a request for proposals
tenders are completely public request for proposal is not
that doesn t mean that people are prevented from providing a request for proposal
the only thing which contracting procedures according to the financial administration manual are prohibiting is to disclose prices to the general public with a request for a proposal
the reason for this is that you may receive more than one or several proposals which are completely different and you are not able to award an request for proposal to a proponent strictly based on the price
you will be basically comparing apples to oranges technically if you are disclosing that
requests for proposals are evaluated on selected criteria price is one of them but obviously there are many others
the evaluation process is completely fair can be verified it is usually a committee and obviously the cost/benefit analysis including bip and article 24 plays a major role
i am not sure if i answered your question but any request for proposals even including the tenders they don t have to be awarded if the government finds that they are not able to pay for it
chairperson interpretation
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairperson
in the presentation out of 108 positions in regional operations a total of 40 new are staffed by inuit
this represents 37% of the work force in the department
the services provided are purchasing contracting building maintenance and delivery of petroleum products
is the department taking a concerted effort to make sure that the inuit employment factor gets up to at least 50% and is the department conscious of that in bringing more people into this department
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
sorry ms thompson or mr mrazek
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
we will make a commitment to do inuit employment plans for the department if it has not been done already
i will be committed to bringing more inuit staff into this department as i have been asked by the member
we will make sure that this is done by this department
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr mclean
mr mclean
the decentralization plan for the department is proceeding
this is scheduled to begin in the year 2000 as additional housing and office space becomes available
speaking for my own community there is an abundance of staff housing and office space
if the minister needs correspondence i can make it available to their department but i am sure that they have it
there are two technical service positions slated for baker lake
getting to that i am also asking is decentralized going to happen a bit quicker than next year in this department
chairperson interpretation
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
from the public works side there are two positions slated with information technology as the support staff for baker lake
that is my understanding according to the organizational charts
to be honest with you i am not sure if these things will happen between now and the next summer
those positions are strictly depending on the decentralization of the other departments to the community because those two positions will be supporting the network for other departments
besides that there will be or there will have to be a training period when we have the outsourcing period with a contractor to train a number of people for those positions
i have just been involved in the rankin situation when we had three potential inuit employees who have microsoft experience and who will be put on line probably within the next couple of weeks
as far as baker i think we will probably have to wait a little while until decentralization is in progress
otherwise those positions will not be able to support anything at this point in time
chairperson interpretation
mr mclean
mr mclean
on that answer i don t find it acceptable
there is a training component in it i have been in the office in rankin inlet at public works and services there and there s an abundance of staff there
so i think by identifying and training a few unemployed inuit people from baker lake that this would probably fast track your positions in baker lake
thank you
thank you
at this time the clock is running could you please make your questions and comments concise and understandable
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i would like to ask this question in respect to petroleum products
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson or mr mrazek
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
sustainable development would probably have something for subsidizing skidoo fuel
but we would be reviewing the cost of fuel in the near future so the members are invited to put in their comments at that time
thank you
chairperson interpretation
is that all
mr tootoo could you make your question concise and understandable please
mr tootoo
honourable members mr chairman i am trying to think how to say it really quick
mr chairman i am wondering if the minister or her staff can let us know if their department is responsible or confirm if their department is responsible for providing all the capital delivery of nunavut
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
yes we are
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
in light of that i know that in some communities and again going back to housing not only in baffin but in other regions there are communities that have been empowered to provide the capital delivery responsible to housing
i am just wondering mr chairman if the department will be looking at honouring those inaudible comment or maybe taking back those responsibilities from the municipalities that are already doing it
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
every case will be slightly different when the local housing association is able willing to provide for capital projects i m referring to housing as you mentioned before but definitely we ll give them every opportunity to do that
most housing associations are developed to the point that they are able to provide this type of building activity
some of them are more developed than others but it s individual cases because it s supporting local community we always look into that first before the decision is made
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mrazek
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
i would hope that it would happen within the baffin i know over the last 2 years all the lho s had delivered all the capital
i m wondering will that be still the case and continuing along with that type of service and more of an advisory and support role
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
thank you mr chairman
yes that basically will continue mr tootoo and i said before and we are giving local housing organization every opportunity for further improvement so they are able to deliver the capital projects
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mrazek
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i have few more short questions is your department responsible for setting the rents the staff will be paying for all the staff housing units
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
it s not exactly public works responsibility it s joint responsibility mainly it is the department human resources and some advise from public works as far as the technical qualifications are concerned
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mrazek
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
does your department would they have an idea as i understand your department covers off all the lease costs related to staff housing
we have to know what rents are going to be charged in order to know the effect and therefore determine the levels of subsidies that are provided to staff for staff housing
i m wondering if the ministers staff can provide us with information on what those subsidies are for the various staff housing units
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
thank you mr chairman
but that s a very general rule
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mrazek
i told you that you would have a last question these people still have not made a comment
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to ask a question in regards to petroleum products
in pelly bay usually when the planes come in to my community there s no fuel for the airplanes and that barge cannot really transport fuel and we are requesting that we get aviation fuel in our community
i was wondering if you department can find ways if to get aviation fuel in pelly bay
that s my first question to find out if we can get aviation fuel how can we get aviation fuel in our community
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation

mr alakannuark i think mr puqiqnak would like to make a comment now because he has been writing notes to me
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
first of all i would like to apologize to my colleague and to her department although i stated earlier that i was a little upset
as i had stated that i don t want to take part in your meeting but i would like to apologize to you as a member of the legislative assembly
i have to represent my community and i hope that we will be working closely together in the future
if the minister can respond to me and perhaps clarify to us after i think that it would ve been better had i known about it
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you
tomorrow morning i ll meet with you at 11 00
i will go ahead and meet with you i didn t think you wanted to take part but we ll continue meeting with you
i received a letter from mr puqiqnak quite a lengthy letter
i cannot tell you that i will be compensating for the snowmobiles but as i have stated to you earlier we will look into it and we will deal with that
i will to continue to work with it but i apologize that the results from the study we still have not gotten the results yet we haven t had a chance to review the results yet
so based on that i can t do anything about the skidoos because i am not sure that it was the fuel that caused them
anyway in the future i am not prepared to help out with the skidoos thank you very much
chairperson mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
now that we will meet with you tomorrow i will expect better answers then
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
thank you for giving me a copy of your opening comment for it gave me better information here
your main estimates for the department are divided 67 1 million dollars for o&m and 5 7 for capital
in regards to article 24 there is quite a bit of dollars to be contracted out accordance to article 24
article 24 states that only if the company is 51% inuit owned they would be the first priority to get the contract
are you using article 24
thank you
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
in regards to your question article 24 we will have to do things in accordance with article 24
our department is now looking at bip and article 24
it seems like article 24 was not acknowledged by our previous government because there were more than one aboriginal in that area
for that reason we will work in accordance to article 24 and how we can implement article 24 and we will be working on this issue in the future and we will involve the regular members
i would like to get your input but at this time we are at our initial stage
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you for giving me a very clear response
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman in the ministers remarks she has indicated that we will spend a budget of 67 1 million dollars for o&m
i just note that a large part of this o&m is under asset management and is approximately 42 million dollars but there is no detail
i wonder if the minister and her staff could provide some detail as to what this 42 million dollars is for
it is not contained in the budget book
thank you
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson
i am sorry we don t have the detail in front of us right now but the finance person here might be able to give us an idea what the question is
we can certainly provide it in detail on paper at a later date if you want
i will ask my finance person here to provide as much detail as he can from what he has
thank you mr chairperson
mr galbraith inaudible comments million dollars and the other o&m consists of 50 million dollars
that line includes the lease payments o&m for the maintenance of the buildings a multitude of activities that we perform
i don t know how much detail you wanted but i could definitely provide that to you at a later date
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
i m not trying to be difficult for asking if information is not reasonable but i think it will be very very difficult to pass this budget of this department without having that information available to us
we re talking about $47 million
i think it s important that we have an opportunity to see this otherwise it wouldn t be prudent for us to pass such a large amount of money without knowing the details
thank you
chairperson
interpretation the finance controller would like to respond
go ahead mr ng
hon kelvin ng
i just wanted to him to give me some clarification because it just seems like you re into the budget detail now
i wasn t sure if we ve moved into that because it was in the general questions and if that s the case it s fine but they d be prepared to answer when we get to the detail page
because we haven t gotten into the page by page yet that mr chairman is the point i was trying to make
thank you
chairperson interpretation
since your information is on the main estimates go ahead
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
i m referring to the opening remarks made by the minister it does indicate $67 1 million
so really what i m questioning is it s a question relating to opening remarks
i don t see the details in the budget period
but if that information is available going page by page well that s fine if we can have it before we conclude this department
i m more than pleased to agree with that
thank you
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson
it seems like the finance person here has dug out the information
he can just read the list down if the member wishes to hear that
interpretation the finance person can go down the list with details
can he go ahead with those
they re not very long
if it s okay with you mr chairman
mr o brien
if the department has those details that s fine
we can wait until the page by page and hear what the details are then
thank you
chairperson interpretation
so are you done
no more question
mr tootoo
let me first ask if ms thompson are you going to ask for comments from the person beside you
what we usually do is that you have to ask general comments and then we go into the detail page by page
and i think that some of the questions that are being asked will be fitting into the page by page and then we can add in the amounts that we were talking about
thank you
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
just want to go back to the earlier comment made by mr mrazek in regards to inquiring whether we wouldn t mind seeing information written
i would love to see that
then i would just ask for some kind of timeline when to expect that information
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
if you re referring to the rent scale as far as the individual housing are concerned we can provide that within one weeks time
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
will that include the lease cost the rent charged to the unit that the tenant would have to pay and the subsidy that the nunavut government is paying
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
go ahead
mr mrazek
i can provide that to you within one weeks time
in the case of the other region it s probably a little bit longer but you know no problem there
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
since there are no more people willing or wanting to ask questions or comments
so back to the main estimates
do you have a copy
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the two people beside my witnesses don t have a copy of the main estimates
you can just go ahead our financial officer doesn t have one
so if there was a spare copy he s got it already
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
are you going to be reading

mr chairman that is correct mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
can i have the amount that is dedicated to just our lease costs
the amount that is for leases chairperson interpretation
go ahead
mr galbraith
yes mr chairman the amount dedicated for lease payments for this year is approximately 20 million dollars chairperson interpretation
mr o brien does that answer your question mr o brien
yes mr chairman i would ask if we could get a detailed written copy that the finance comptroller just provided to us in more detail and just to get this clear in my mind
he has indicated that our lease costs out of this 47 million dollars is approximately 20 million dollars
is that correct chairperson interpretation
go ahead mr galbraith
that s the amount that has been budgeted that s an approximation i can get the exact and the specifications at a later date but it s approximately 20 million dollars of that amount that has been budgeted for lease payments chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien

in reference to contract services and other amounts

mr chairperson it is something as well in that 34 million dollars contract payments part of that is leases

petroleum products revolving fund
information item
public service revolving fund
information item
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson in reference to the petroleum products revolving fund
we have an authorized limit of 60 million dollars the expenditures are at 39 807
i wonder if the minister or one of her staff could speak briefly to the workings of this fund and the purpose so members can have a better understanding as to what it is for
thank you chairperson
galbraith mr galbraith
thank you mr chairperson
the revolving fund is set up separately from public works as all revolving funds are
i guess the best way to put it is that it is basically a separate balance sheet altogether and it doesn t play into the regular expenditures of the government
the authorized limit here of 60 million was taken from all of the gnwt for last year and it could be cut down considerably
it was put together as you ll notice the other revolving funds as well and it was taken from the main estimates from last year because we couldn t put the number together quick enough
but that is the authorized limit
their supplying the service of providing fuel to the communities so their expenditures are to try to equal the sales
thank you mr chairperson chairperson
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman in view of the time we will soon have to make a decision as to whether to extend our hours to conclude this department
or we would have to make a motion to report progress
i certainly don t want to make that on behalf of the members so we should get consensus as to what the wish is before we run out of time chairperson
mr o brien mr o brien
mr chairman i would like to move that we extend the hours to conclude this item some members
agreed chairperson interpretation
there is a motion on the floor to extend the time to conclude this department
to the motion
those in favour of the motion please signify
those opposed
the motion is carried
our meeting will go beyond 6 o clock to finish this department public service revolving fund
information item
mr tootoo mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
just on that you said the authorized limit is 60 million dollars and we should be able to come in way short of that and that was the amount for last year that was in the total gnwt budget
is that an amount that is taken out and put aside an amount of dollars or is that just a limit that you can go up to it is not tying up any dollars from anywhere else
is that the case
thank you mr chairperson chairperson
mr galbraith mr galbraith
thank you mr chairperson
yes that is correct mr chairman chairperson interpretation
public service revolving fund
information item
agreed
you don t have to agree to that
okay 6 12 granular program revolving fund information item 6 13 detail of work performed on behalf of third parties
information item
mr tootoo mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i had a question on the granular program revolving fund
unfortunately i didn t get recognized in time before you switched over
i would ask to go back and ask a short little question in regards to the granular program revolving fund
thank you mr chairperson chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo is requesting to go back to the granular program revolving fund
are there any nays
since i don t hear any nays you may go ahead mr tootoo
try to put your hand up high when you want to speak so we can see you
mr tootoo mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i m only so tall but i will try better
mr chairman just again just a question for clarification
is this amount again another amount that was derived from last year s gnwt budget
if so if it was not that is my first point on that question if you could answer that
thank you mr chairperson chairperson
mr galbraith mr galbraith
thank you mr chairperson
i want you to understand that the department of public works really didn t have a finance division set up at headquarters and the regional office we weren t much involved in this
well we were involved in the sense that we were consulted by the department of finance in putting this budget together
to answer your question yes this is a gnwt number coming from last year s main estimates
the number more theoretically here in nunavut is more to the 4 - 6 million range chairperson
mr tootoo mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i just want to confirm that it was not just a nunavut thing as i would imagine that if it was taken off last years there s going to be a lot more need for granular materials throughout nunavut chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
ms thompson hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson the second comment i think the last comment he made was just a comment not a question chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
is that all
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
i ask for your indulgence
i was concentrating on the petroleum products revolving fund when i asked the question as to whether we should report progress or continue
once we made that agreement i didn t get a chance to finish my question
i wonder if i could go back for one question regarding the petroleum products revolving fund and the 60 million dollars that s identified in the budget chairperson interpretation
i believe this has to be approved
are you asking us to agree
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
as i ve indicated the authorized limit is 60 million dollars in the revolving fund
this i believe is also a gnwt figure
so is this representing at the time the total fund for the gnwt and for nunavut
if it is then this fund should be much greatly reduced and probably cut in half if that is my understanding
what is a realistic number because this is what the budget is now so what actually is a closer number that would represent nunavut chairperson interpretation
mr galbraith mr galbraith
thank you mr chairperson
i am not all exactly sure what the authorized limit actually means
it is not necessarily a budget figure i believe that they would have to should they exceed this in sales or expenditures they would have to go and get some sort of permission
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
one final question and a point of clarification
if this figure is not accurate and we re being asked to pass this budget and the figure is not accurate what figure would more closely reflect the nunavut situation chairperson
ms thompson hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman we are just borrowing mr galbraith from the regional office he is not a headquarters person we are just borrowing him from the region
he is doing us a favour by being here so just be patient and bear with us
when i became the minister of the department we just had three staff that was the dm the adm and another adm or a secretary
my apologies thank you chairperson interpretation
mr galbraith if you could perhaps clarify the figure mr galbraith
thank you mr chairperson
i just want to emphasize that the authorized limit is the upset limit so to speak
it is an arbitrary number they tried to get it as accurate as possible but this number included the west
the numbers below there the income and expenditures the salary and wages was put together by our team in rankin inlet and was put into the budget and these numbers are right on
thank you mr chairperson chairperson interpretation
did you get the clarification you wanted mr o brien
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman maybe i am not as informed on this issue as i should be
i don t want to cause any confusion or embarrassment to the minister or her staff and i realize that they are a very new department and so on
but i think what i am trying to do is just get this straight in my mind and in the other members that are here in their mind
this is i think a very significant barrier we are talking about a large number of dollars here
i will ask a question maybe mr mrazek because i know he has been around for quite a while he may be able to shed some more light on this
if for example the authorized limit is 60 million dollars if that weren t utilized could that money be used for something else
thank you chairperson interpretation
mr mrazek mr mrazek
what i would like to answer is that finance is not my background and i cannot really make that comment or commitment as to what could be done with the balance of the money
as mr galbraith said basically the money is not really in the budget from that standpoint
it is a maximum limit to which petroleum products can buy fuel or any other thing
they cannot go anything over that but they always stay below chairperson interpretation
madame minister perhaps you could shed more light on the matter hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson
what you are approving is the two numbers and those are the numbers that make sense
these are main estimates what we would think that we would be spending but as mr mrazek has just indicated this is not the actual number it goes below that
what you are approving is 39 million 807 thousand if you are wanting to approve it
thank you mr chairperson chairperson interpretation
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
please bear with me
i am just trying to sort out more details about the revolving fund itself
can the revolving fund be used for example to construct a capital project
can the revolving fund be used for anything other than petroleum products
it strictly deals with the purchase of petroleum products
is that correct chairperson interpretation
ms thompson hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson i know mr ng would really like to answer that but i will answer it for him anyway
this is strictly for petroleum products thank you chairperson
mr tootoo mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i am going to beg the indulgence of the members and they might know better but maybe i am just asking would a better way to explain this revolving fund authorized limit would be like a line of credit
so there is no actual cash involved from any other sources within government dollars
is that a simpler way to explain it
thank you mr chairperson chairperson
mr galbraith
ms thompson hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson i might refer this to the finance minister
he wasn t listening was he
did you get the question
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
it is my understanding that this is like a line of credit it authorizes the petroleum products fund to purchase inventory and then use the inventories to recover the costs of supplying that inventory
this isn t an approval item this is actually an information item that we are debating here
so i don t know if that clarifies it it is supposed to be revenue neutral whatever you bring in it goes back out in expenditures and inventory
thank you chairperson interpretation
i believe that question was answered
mr anawak i believe you wanted to make a comment or question hon jack anawak interpretation
not to the matter i just wanted to tell ms thompson in respect to the granular program revolving fund i know that they stockpile in some communities
i have noted twice in broughton clyde river and rankin inlet that the granular materials usually have a written thing this is owned by dpw do not trespass
i am just wondering about that chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
you stated that you were talking about some other matter i just saw a do not trespass sign on the granular stockpiles i believe that is more of a comment than a question

importance of literacy birthday
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
recognizing that our children are the future leaders of nunavut it is imperative to give them the tools leading to their success

i believe that literacy is very important and should not be overlooked it is crucial that the government of the nunavut acknowledge the seriousness of this issue by continuing to support literacy
i would also like to take this opportunity to wish my son kyle siksinaaq mclean a happy 8th birthday and i d like to be there today

equitable staff housing allocation
mr tootoo
thank you speaker
mr speaker i rise today to speak on the matter of staff housing not only here in iqaluit but in the rest of our communities
i think we all agree that the employees of the government of nunavut deserve to be in adequate accommodations
i am concerned that there seems to be multiple levels operating especially here in iqaluit
i hope now after april 1st there is only one standard and that all employees whether their headquarters or regional staff are being allocated housing based on their need for suitable affordable adequate housing

congratulations to coral harbour teacher education program graduates
hon james arvaluk
interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i m pleased and proud as the member from nanulik to extend my congratulations to the first graduates of the community teacher education program in coral harbour who are graduating today
these graduates have taken the first step to success and whether they go on to further study or go directly to the workplace they are the future of this new territory
these graduates also will be the teachers of the future generations to come
we did not achieve nunavut alone nor have they achieved graduation alone therefore i would also like to thank their families friends and teachers for the support they have given them throughout their studies and trying times
education is not accomplished alone and the support of others is essential our culture is one of collaboration and connectedness
we must continue to celebrate the sense of community and sharing
education does not necessarily mean textbooks alone it also includes the community and sharing culturally and i would like to congratulate these students on their success
that s a real position that you have worked hard to obtain and you deserve the honour accompanied by the success
that is for the students in coral harbour

item 6
oral questions
question 66 - 1 2
allocation of staff housing
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the minister responsible for staff housing i believe the minister for human resources
mr speaker i m wondering if the minister could inform us as to whether this staff housing is for all government employees or is there a distinction between headquarters and regional staff
thank you mr speaker
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker right now as i indicated there are two different approval mechanisms and i also believe i have indicated that s why we re trying to co-ordinate a new staff housing policy and take into consideration all those factors
we also have the issue of staff housing in our regional centres as well that we ve inherited so there is a multitude of issues that has to address
thank you mr speaker
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
thank you mr speaker
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i believe i indicated that we inherited both mechanisms and both policies for allocations
one and he recognized it in his statement as well one from gnwt on the regional allocation for regional positions and one at the headquarters level that was inherited from the office of interim commissioner
so right now one of the issues quite frankly is how do you deal with that
do you pull them together and if that were the case for example you have dedicated headquarters positions that are targeted for headquarter staffing
so those are the kinds of issues as i have indicated that have to be addressed
one other issue quite frankly the people probably haven t realized and i think that we have to address that as well is what about our employees right now that are in public housing
it has to be looked at and explored in some form of these
thank you mr speaker
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo

do they have to be stuck in those accommodations while we have existing units that are sitting empty and i believe we re paying for them

hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
you will be handed out the notes for my opening comments
mr chairman and honourable members of the legislative assembly i am pleased to present to you the 1999/2000 main estimates for the department of justice
i think i will be introducing the officials later remind me if i forget
the justice system is important to each one of us
it affects the everyday lives of people across nunavut the 1999-2000 main estimates reflect the department s effort to promote a shift in the way that justice services have been delivered in the past
the business plan which we wish to undertake outlines critical issues facing the department of justice we face serious challenges
the answers will not be easy
the business plan and the budget for the department of justice does not include funding for new initiatives other than the establishment of the nunavut court of justice
this nunavut court of justice was already put in motion by the interim commissioner on the advice of the nunavut implementation commission and after a consultation conference sponsored by the office of the interim commissioner in november 1997
in this initial year we will be assessing the expenditures of the department and determining first if there are any funds that can be re-allocated within existing allocations
we believe that long term solutions will only be reached through working with communities or better yet giving communities the authority to deal with problems themselves
we recognize that in order for this to happen we will need to provide more support including funding to communities in the future
the responsibility to support communities in providing healing training and crime prevention will also require us to work closely with other departments of the nunavut government
culture language elders and youth as an example health and social services education and my other portfolio community government housing and transportation
1999/2000 will be an important year for the department as we work with programs that we have inherited from the nwt and we will have to assess how they are functioning and what changes may be needed
several of our programs are contracted back to the gnwt for this transitional year
we will be working hard to get the staff and infrastructure in place to establish the full range of programs here in nunavut by the end of the year
we will be doing some important planning this year too
for example a corrections planning committee has been established to review corrections program and facility requirements and make recommendations
this committee has representation from communities as well as from the corrections system and we expect them to consider new approaches to the way in which inmates are handled
in cooperation with the department of justice for canada the assistant deputy minister rebecca williams has held meetings with community justice chairs from all the regions within nunavut
the information and advice received from them will help guide the department in determining how to support further development of community justice capacity as an alternative to the formal justice system within nunavut
i also have to say that the delivery of probation services will continue to be done by social workers
the social workers are paid through the department of health and social services
this will continue with regard to the law review process being requested by cabinet additional funds will have to be found
my department s budget would not cover this expenditure
you will see in your materials that the budget for the department of justice is broken down into two main categories
first operations and maintenance and then the capital plan
in your review of the main estimates you will see on page 5-3 that our operations and maintenance budget totals $36 998 000 00
through the framework exercise our original budget requirement was reduced to the amount currently allocated
the operations and maintenance part of the budget is broken down by these branches within the department
directorate law enforcement legal services board lawyer support services registries and court services as well as community justice and corrections directorate
directorate
this branch is responsible for the management and administration of the department
law enforcement
this refers to the contract with the r c m p
legal services board
the boards are responsible for the delivery of legal aid services throughout nunavut
lawyer support services
departmental lawyers are responsible for example we have departmental lawyers in our department
they will be providing the nunavut government with legal advice
registries and court services
this category covers a wide range of items including the various legal registries the nunavut court of justice and other functions such as the coroner and the fair practices/rental officer
community justice and corrections
this branch is responsible for the operation of the baffin correctional centre here in iqaluit and out post camps as well as the funding for community justice committees
as you can see the department of justice has a very small capital budget totalling $313 000
approximately $300 000 is for security upgrades at the correctional centre here in iqaluit
additional capital funding will be required in the future if we are going to repatriate our offenders from nwt institutions
the department is waiting for recommendations from the corrections planning committee before identifying these future capital needs
mr chairman this concludes the formal part of my presentation today
we will be pleased to answer any questions you have about the budget for the department of justice
i am also interested in comments you may have or ideas about how we can work together to build a stronger justice system
i would like to invite my officials mr chairman
nora sanders my deputy minister and mike rudolph my financial advisor
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
you may step to the witness chair including your officials

mr puqiqnak7
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i will be reading so please do not i will try not to put you to sleep so please bear with me
in respect to the department of justice mr chairman i will be reading the report
mr anawak appeared before the committee on the morning of april 30th
the main estimate summary provided to the committee indicated the total 1999/2000 in expenditures of $37 310 706 of which $313 000 00 is allotted to capital spending
the committee was quite impressed with the level of detail provided during the ministers appearance
the nunavut law review
the minister stated that the cabinet had approved in principle a nunavut law review which would operate independently but they would have to report to the minister of justice
this would be in consultation with the minister of culture language elders and youth
the committee encouraged the minister to involve the elders in the work of the review to the fullest extent as possible
mr chairman we also want to speak to the single time zone for nunavut
i believe they say that they use a different clock they use a different one but we are speaking about the single time zone for nunavut
the minister indicated that his department had undertaken a legal review of this initiative that was announced by the commissioner in her opening address to the assembly on april 1/ 1999
the minister also indicated that this might be accomplished in the spring or summer of this year
the committee urged the minister to implement this change at the earliest opportunity
mr chairman in respect to the gun registration
the committee expressed a very strong concern in respect to unilingual inuit constituents have great difficulty associated with completing paperwork
this has caused difficulties for the people associated with the federal government registration policies
the minister indicated that in respect of the upcoming discussions with his federal counterpart that the issue would be raised with a view to exploring solutions
the committee would like an update on this issue as soon as new information becomes available to the department in respect to gun registration issues
community justice
the committee was very happy and applauded the ministers commitment to emphasizing the importance of progress in this field
the committee noted the ministers caution that budgetary restraints have put pressure on the funds allocated for this area
one member suggested that the communities should be responsible for dealing with summary offences
for example using summary offences that are not dangerous acts the community justice committee should be able to deal with them
mr chairman the minister also indicated his desire to see a more uniform functioning of the community justice committees across nunavut
just as an example to ensure that offenders do not become repeat offenders
the committee was supportive of the ministers goal to work with minister picco in pursuing the establishment of a probation system for the department
corrections planning committee
the minister provided an update on the activities of the newly formed corrections planning committee which would be meeting again in may
one issue that the members of the committee raised was the possibility of a federal correctional facility being established in nunavut
the minister indicated that the corrections planning committee would study the issue but that it was too soon to say yes to a joint facility
members expressed their interest in seeing a correctional facility established in the kitikmeot and keewatin
on the land outpost camps
the committee expressed its desire to see the program accelerated
the minister indicated that the program hadn t taken off as quickly as the department would have liked but they would make efforts to do so if feasible
the ministers deputy further noted that the corrections representatives had recently travelled to baker lake and arviat and would travel to kitikmeot in june
security considerations were cited as being an obstacle to overnight success with respect to this issue
that concludes the committee report mr chairman i would like to move a motion

mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson the standing committees reports on the main estimates
in the committees report the figure is different
i would like to ask the minister that in his opening remarks his figures are totally different from the committee report and from the main estimates
i would like to get a response as the figures in all three documents are different
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
the department s main estimates are 37 million 311 thousand for capital expenditures 313 thousand
part of the 313 thousand is for security upgrades at the correctional centre here in iqaluit
i could get detailed information for the 313 thousand but the main estimates figure is 37 million 311 thousand it did not change
i just want to explain to you that the capital will be 313 thousand but the operations & maintenance is 36 thousand 998 mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu are you more clear now
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
yes i see them now thank you
chairperson interpretation
are there any other general comments
i don t have any people on my list please raise your hands if you have any questions
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
just in regards to the gun control registration
i wanted to ask the minister if that was a responsibility of his department or was the responsibility for that program under his federal counterparts department
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
the federal government s justice minister is responsible for gun registration
i was going to meet with minister ann mclellan on may 3rd i went down to ottawa to meet with her but somebody got shot in alberta and she had to go to the funeral
therefore i couldn t get connected with her so we will have a meeting on june 7th
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i guess the administration of this program as the minister indicated falls under federal jurisdiction
is the minister aware of how many employees the federal justice department has to administer this program in nunavut
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
gnwt did not want to take on this responsibility so the federal government has this jurisdiction at this time
gnwt had been asked to take on this responsibility but they did not want to take it on we don t have any staff members so i would like to discuss this matter
i tried to meet with ann mclellan but she had to go to alberta for a funeral as a student was shot in one of the schools
at his time we don t have any staff members now but would like to get a staff member who is inuit and bilingual and could reflect inuit culture
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
the minister mentioned the gnwt i wonder if he meant the government of nunavut or the old gnwt as far as taking on these programs
hon jack anawak interpretation
they asked the gnwt if they would take on this responsibility
i have been trying to get together with the minister so we can look at means and ways of dealing with gun registration in nunavut
chairperson interpretation
please recognize the chair before you make your comments
thank you
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman just to point out to the minister i know hopefully he will be bringing up these concerns with his federal counterpart is that this whole process is very cumbersome for the inuit people in nunavut
hon jack anawak interpretation
that is what i have been trying to say for a long time
i have been trying to get in touch with the minister and i know the concerns very well as i am a hunter myself
i know exactly where the rest of the hunters of nunavut are coming from
i think we should be able to do that without spending any money from nunavut
what we have been trying to do is work together with the justice department at the federal level
we have tried to set up meetings
we did have two tentative meetings which were cancelled and there is another one set up for june 7 i believe
chairperson interpretation
is that an adequate response mr tootoo
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman the minister spoke about the use of traditional counselling land camps and so on and i think that everyone here is in support of that strongly
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you as i said earlier there is a committee struck to deal with the setting up of such a structure
rebecca williams can talk about it in detail because she works with that committee
they are considering and talking with the department of justice at the federal level about setting up some type of facility in the nunavut area
rebecca williams and i went to fenbrook which is a federal penitentiary
i can t say it was a nice tour but the facility is situated in a southern province
we are going to work very hard to see if we can house those inmates up here and we are going to keep looking for money
for the serious crimes we are going to keep sending the inmates down south
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
just for a point of clarification mr chairman
can you clarify that thank you
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
mr chairman
interpretation ends there is a possibility of getting some funding to get a correctional facility up here which would probably focus at the beginning on the more medium security type inmates
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
thank you mr anawak that answered my question
i thought it was a little too harsh using the word murderers but what i was referring to was the more serious crimes but not to that degree
more or less an expansion of what we have now for example in the baffin and over in yk
my second comment or question is in reference to law reform
you have indicated that you are going to involve elders in this review
what role do you see for the members that sit on the standing committee on justice
what role do you see these members playing in this review
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
mr chairman at this point in time we are having discussions with culture language elders & youth on the law review
we have not come to the point of deciding exactly what the make up will be but it will certainly be with the advice and the participation of some members or a member of that committee
i mean if we are going to move forward we want to move forward with regular members
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
for further clarification i would like to know how many judges there are in nunavut
how many judges are there that work on the circuit in the nunavut area
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
maybe ms sanders could respond to that question chairperson
ms sanders
ms sanders two judges have been appointed
the senior judge judge brown is already sitting here the second judge judge kilpatrick will be coming in june
he was sworn in on april 1st but has not yet started
hopefully by this time next year there will be a third judge appointed and those three judges will serve all of nunavut
so right now 2 and there will be 3
at times we also have deputy judges or judges from other jurisdictions that come for a week or two to help out or to do a circuit that sort of thing
that can be where there is a conflict or where the work load gets too heavy
chairperson interpretation
thank you ms sanders
we heard both the inuktitut and the english on one channel
could we have the technician fix that problem please
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
the reason why i asked that question is just because you don t have enough judges you defer some of the sittings
for example they set appointments for when they re going to be sitting and they keep deferring the date from one date to the next and possibly three-four times
they re adjourned three-four times is it because of a lack of judges that you keep adjourning the sittings
they set up an appointment it doesn t go through then they set another sitting and so on and it effects the people who have to wait a long time to go through the court system
is there a good reason
there could be a lot of reasons that the person can be effected like there s tiredness there s anxiousness and everything else so that s why i asked my question
chairperson interpretation
thank you puqiqnak
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
ms sanders will make a supplementary to my remarks
what we did was set up one court system when we became nunavut because it seems that it takes a longer time when you have different levels
possibly ms sanders could make a supplementary comment
chairperson
ms sanders
ms sanders
i think the minister s already said the important things
chairperson interpretation
any further questions
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we re going to be responsible for the operations and maintenance and because of that i will not be able to support the building of such facilities
the correctional if we re looking at the correctional centres in the nunavut area we re just going to be using money instead of helping our people
we have to think like that in the future
if we re going to be building correctional centres and jails and so on it s just going to be eating our money without helping the people
with that in mind the nunavut government should seriously look into preventative and educational programs
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
i we would be very glad to start such programs if we didn t need correctional centres or jails
i truly support the idea of setting up such programs but of course there s always going to be people in correctional facilities
there s some in fenbrook and some in bowden and some in yellowknife
we are putting our money into those facilities every day and we pay the ontario government we pay the alberta government and the government of the northwest territories for housing these inmates
of course we truly support preventative methods and educational programs if we can find money to pay for such programs
but looking at the number of people that are in the southern penitentiaries i don t believe that the numbers are going to decrease
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you
there s not much we can do in that area but i think we have to work together
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
regarding the comments that were just made by the member
i know that i think there s a concern in all of the communities people often feel that someone who hasn t offended seriously should not have been sent away
that s why we want to see local people dealing with these issues especially when they are jps dealing with people that they know and who come from the community
what is your problem
what can we do to help you
but that step is not part of the present administration of justice so we want to promote those kinds of things and we re working on getting those kinds of programs in place
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
are you finished
yes i understand what you are saying and i think that you all understand the same thing but you re just in different stages of trying to reach your goal
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i have a question that i would like to ask regarding the role of the elders and it s one of the goals of the department to involve elders in their programs
now in which way are you going to involve the elders
is that going to be at the local level or are you going to get the elders together to decide on the goals and objectives of the department
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes thank you
i think we also have to be aware that not only the elders have to be involved
we will have to involve the young people as well because i think we all know that they have different things to contribute
we have different understandings and different issues in various stages of life when we say adults we re thinking about elders those people who are older than us not just adults
i just want you to be aware of that
the elders are much more involved in justice issues especially in the area of justice committees in smaller communities
when we re talking about the department of justice i know you re asking about that
i think that the nunavut government is going to be using the elders in their programs
we re trying to institute the inuit traditional knowledge or inuit qaujimajituqangit
this is going to be one of the first priorities in how we can involve the elders and other people in the communities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes i understand what you are saying
we will need jails in the future as well as now
we have a traditional system of justice and our forefathers did not use jails
i know that you have to send some people to jail yes that s a given and it s not going to go away but we have to somehow to use the traditional form of dealing with the offenders
that has not worked
i think sometimes people are sent away to jail like to penitentiaries when it would not have been necessary
even people who are still in denial of having committed a crime are convicted in court and is sent away to heal
presently the people who have been sent away to correctional centres and jails have not seen a healing process
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes thank you mr chairman
i m sorry i forgot to mention that
that is another area that we re seriously looking at we need to have on the land programs where people can go to as an alternative to jails
if we re going to institute a traditional form of justice i think we can be looking at that
if we change everything right away it might not be a good thing for everybody
i know that people have been hurt by the system because it s not their system and they did not set it up but right now we don t have much alternative to the present court system
that s why we want to review this first and try and institute the inuit way of dealing with offenders
i think that we re going to see fewer people being put away even though i was talking about putting people into correctional centres or penitentiaries but in an inuit sense being punished is not really in our vocabulary
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman just a question for the minister
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman

chairperson
tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
anawak
hon jack anawak
there has to be an understanding that the gun control challenge has nothing to do with hunting rights
chairperson interpretation
tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i don t mean to get going on this but he still hasn t answered whether there would be grounds to pursue it or not
and no mention to whether it relates to hunting rights or anything like that i m just wondering if there are grounds to pursue a challenge or not i m wondering if there are grounds or not
that s quite simple
thank you mr chairman
hon jack anawak
one part of canada is not challenging the bill it s a judgement call more than anything else
chairperson interpretation
tootoo
i think it ll be your last question mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess then in that case and as the minister mentioned it it s up to what you consider grounds
is it not the justice department s mandate to provide advice to the government on such matters
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
again my advice is that we don t have to expend the 400 thousand dollars
chairperson interpretation
i would like to give a chance to those members who did not have a chance to ask their questions or comments
mr nutarak did you want to make a comment
no
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation

mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i want to get back to the gun bill
i understand what mr tootoo is saying and we know that there is a lot of concern out there regarding the bill
i know in my community there have been many comments and concerns raised
i guess the train is already heading down the track and somebody else is paying for the gas we should just look forward to it getting to it s destination
my concern right now is the problem we have in the meantime in people trying to get their guns registered
thank you
chairperson interpretation
who would like to respond
hon jack anawak
chairperson interpretation
do you have anything further mr o brien
mr o brien
no that s all i have to say at this point
mr chairman i wonder if it is time to move on to line by line
chairperson interpretation
if there are no further comments yes we can go line by line
are there any comments
just in case we adjourn early i would like to take a ten minute break
>>committee recesses for ten minutes
chairperson interpretation

thank you for coming back
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
for information purposes for mr akesuk the contracts that we have total $3 983 563 these are the contracts that we have
i apologize for something i said earlier we are not paying for the federal inmates
it is the federal government that pays for the services
i thought we were paying for the whole justice services but for the federal legislation we are not paying for any federal inmates
oh i am sorry when i was talking about the amount of money we were spending on the inmates i may have inadvertently said something wrong here
regarding the federal inmates the government of nunavut is not putting any money into the federal inmates
that is paid for by the government of canada
i just wanted to clarify that
interpretation mr chairman if it is ok with you i would like to recognize two people who are here
i would like to acknowledge nicole campaugh
she was from rankin inlet but she moved to yellowknife and another person who is here from rankin inlet mayor of rankin inlet simon okpatauyak

mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in the middle one under grants and contributions - $510 000 00 i would like to get further clarification on what that is for
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation yes
this $510 000 00 is for the communities
it is the community justice program
perhaps i will talk a little bit about that issue
in baffin region $215 000 00
kitikmeot $94 000 00 and keewatin $13 000 00 total $440 500 00
but the difference the remaining funds could be used for victim assistance programs
this $440 500 00 will be used for community justice programs but the remainder will be for the victims
$60 000 00
is that clear now
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu if you could look at the last page
in the details of grants and contributions there is detailed information here
do you have any further questions
which page are you on 5-11 details of grants and contributions page 5-11
the detailed information is in that page
contributions for community justice initiatives
mr iqaqrialu mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman chairperson interpretation
thank you minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
regarding the $440 000 00 that is geared towards community justice programs if there was a surplus from that program we would not take it back
they would keep it
but i could give you detailed information as to what is allowed to the communities on these funds that are allotted to community justice programs
perhaps i apologize i would like ms sanders to explain this
chairperson interpretation
go ahead ms sanders
ms sanders interpretation
thank you mr chairman
interpretation ends each of the community contributions to the justice committees that we have allocated this year are the same as they received last year
we are also negotiating today and tomorrow with justice canada to see if they will match that funding
that is not a definite thing yet but we are quite optimistic about that
so that would increase the amount for each community
hon jack anawak interpretation
in view of these court system changes perhaps we are now trying to give more responsibility to the community justice committees
although this fund is now $440 500 00 if it is possible to get additional funding from the federal government we will work harder to get the amount larger next year
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the community justice committees i don t know if they are paid honoraria when they deal with these issues if this includes the jp s
i don t know if the jp s get honoraria or if they are paid
i think everyone has to have a clear understanding including myself and my constituency as to what kind of operations and maintenance they have for each community
this is self explanatory but i don t know especially in our community if we have a justice program in our community so i will look into it
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
when the funding is allotted to the communities the community justice committee it is up to their discretion as to how much they would expend there is no criteria given to the committees in the communities
chairperson interpretation
yes in regards to mr iqaqrialus comment it would be easier to understand if it was that way
tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman this is the area that deals with the correctional in paying for the inmates that we send over to ycc and that area is that the amount included in the other o&m in the 6 8 million
i just wanted to get clarification on that
hon jack anawak the budget for offenders held in the nwt is
adult male offenders $4 281 000 00
female offenders $241 000 00 and
young offenders $603 000 00 for a
total of $5 125 000 00 in terms of spending on all the offenders based in the nwt
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i wonder if the amount allocated in the budget takes into consideration the fee that we get charged from the government of the northwest territories only in that area
i was wondering if that is what is budgeted in there
thank you mr chairman
ms sanders
these budget amounts are not all being paid to the gnwt we are not committed to paying those to the nwt
but at any given time we may have as many offenders there as we have here because of the lack of capacity to be here
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i was wondering if that was something that was added on to after or if it has indeed been something that was overlooked
thank you mr chairman
ms sanders interpretation thank you mr chairman
interpretation ends apparently those calculations were estimated as part of the budgets for the corrections facility here
that is where the transportation costs for the inmates were included and we are hoping that they will be adequate

nunavut governments commitment to elders
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i want to share with you our departments commitment to help our elders in nunavut
elders are a very special group of people in our inuit society
our culture is a verbal one
we never had a writing system
our knowledge about our culture and language is passed on through generations of inuit thousands of years ago
our elders are a walking history
their knowledge is filled with inuktitut and inuinnaqtun words that are unknown to our younger society
they are passed on to us through legends spirituality shamanism and inuit traditional songs or phihiit
the inuit ways must not be allowed to disappear
uqartii we must always remember the fact that it is because of our elders that we are here today
uqartii in november 1998 we gathered 26 elders and 26 youth in iqaluktuuttiaq cambridge bay for the first time in our nunavut history
if there was one thing we ve established out of this important conference it was better communication between our elders and youth
that is the way is used to be and that is what it must be today and in the future
our government is committed to continue this dialogue between these two groups
our department is committed to continue these annual conferences
we must place a high priority to our elders
mr speaker each time an elder dies he or she takes with them a whole lot of knowledge about inuit/inuinnaqtun culture and language
it is urgent that all of us in nunavut begin to utilize these people
we need their help
our government is committed to looking what ways of how we can better utilize our elders
uqartii i have asked my department to look into the possibility of establishing this important initiative
i have asked my department to start to assembly and collect the oral history of our nunavut elders and resources which document the history of nunavut
mr speaker much of this materials exists in different locations across the country and it is time to bring it home
doing this is not a luxury - it is something we must do
uqartii i believe and i trust the members here will all share this belief - that our history and our culture is what makes us strong
it is what must be taught to our youth by elders and in the education system if our youth are to be proud knowledgeable and informed about where we have come from
in this fashion they will have a clearer vision of where we need to go
uqartii ahiitlu katimamajiuqatitka i am proud to recognize the importance of my department recording and developing the cultural and historical record on which our nunavut territory is based
in the meantime i would like to take this opportunity in thanking all of our elders in nunavut for their hard work contribution to our lives wisdom guidance and traditional knowledge
let me be heard by the population of nunavut that our government is committed to work towards a betterment of our elders
we must make sure that we start to utilize them in promoting inuit qaujimajatunqangit
that is the way it should be

members statements
members statement 49 - 1 2 importance of decentralized government
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker for over 25 years the people of the eastern arctic have been planning and working toward the realization of having their own government
the dream of nunavut holds many promises and benefits for its people
mr speaker another more far reaching and tangible concept is to have a decentralized government that would bring the government closer to the people which would provide many benefits such as real community empowerment responsibility and much needed employment
mr speaker for twenty some years the power of control rested far away from small nunavut communities
that power base was yellowknife and thus one of the reasons for this new government of nunavut a government closer to the people
mr speaker this brings me to my main point
the people in the smaller less fortunate hamlets of nunavut have been promised a decentralized government
a government closer to the people
mr speaker a decision not to have a decentralized government would be unfair misleading and would create doubt in the real meaning of nunavut
finally mr speaker some people in this government may say we cannot afford a decentralized government
mr speaker i say we cannot afford not to have a decentralized government

mr speaker traditionally fridays members make statements of a lighter or more humorous note
i am not able to do that today as i have to speak to the serious concern that occurred yesterday in this house
mr speaker as indicated in hansard on our orders of the day number 16 notices of motions for first reading of bills and number 18 first reading of bills are very similar mr speaker very similar
after several days of practice rehearsal and method acting training
a member didn t work
>>laughter
hon ed picco
i was able to pull off a totally realistic portrayal of a minister mistaken in the orders of the day
indeed mr speaker my portrayal was so realistic mr ng the house leader many of the members the tv audience and indeed the media were fooled into thinking i didn t know the difference between number 16 and number 18
>>laughter
mr speaker later today i will be prepared to give acting lessons to the members and i will also take this opportunity to thank the members for your help and consideration on the process
mr speaker i will be picking up the oscar on the break later today and i invite the members to attend with me

payroll deductions nunavut teachers and staff
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
as we are a new government we are going to be asking a lot of questions about what we should be doing
one of the questions that has been pointed out to me is that interpretation ends deductions which are going to the plans like unemployment canada pension plan retirement and so on
this was done by the government of the northwest territories federal government before nunavut became a reality
so they are concerned about losing out just because they have been transferred to the nunavut government it would be good if the teachers in my constituency could be reassured that they are not going to lose out
members statement 52 - 1 2
congratulations on success of session
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes thank you
first i am very proud that this has been a very successful session of the legislative assembly this week
i think that even though we have never really been involved in a legislative assembly we should be proud of ourselves in the way we have conducted ourselves this week
even though we did some stumbling overall i think this week has been a good beginning and we should all be proud of ourselves in our success this week
i think it shows among the members that they have a sense of humour they are willing to learn from their mistakes and i would like to congratulate all the members for this successful week

question 67 - 1 2
translation of legislation
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this morning in caucus we were dealing with proposed bills
i have a question for mr ng
if we are going to be proposing bills i would suggest that all the proposed bills be in both inuktitut and english
my problem was there were some things missing in inuktitut
i would suggest that everything be properly translated if they are going to be done into inuktitut
that is for a clarification
speaker
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i don t know if there was a question there but i would like to respond
the government is cognizant of the fact that legislation must be understood before we pass legislation
i think it is just the logistics right now the logistics and the significant expertise to actually draft legislation and whether that is able to be done in syllabics in its entirety
i think what the government would propose probably is that the intent of the bill the legislation summaries would certainly be available in syllabics but right now it is the logistics of working out that process

business incentive policy
mr o brien

mr speaker my question is to the minister responsible for public works telecommunications & technical services
in reference to the bip the business incentive policy i wonder if the minister can tell the members whether there have been any changes to that policy
i understand that it has been transferred from the gnwt into the nunavut government whether or not any changes have been made to the old policy and if companies in nunavut have copies of it
thank you
speaker
thank you two questions
minister of public works telecommunications & technical services ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
the business incentive policy of the government is ongoing until we have come up as a government with a new policy for this government
so it is continuing until we come up with something else including article 24 we have to work with that policy for this government
thank you
speaker
thank you ms thompson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker from those comments i assume that there have been no changes in the old bip

thank you mr o brien
minister thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
i understand that the cabinet i know we have approved an interim nunavut bip and contract procedures which will not be disrupting any projects that are ongoing for this summer

transfer of staff from gnwt to nunavut government
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the transferring from the government of the northwest territories to the nunavut government
the teachers there are quite a number of teachers out there in the nunavut territories
were hoping to increase the number of teachers to keep up with the student ratio
education is very important to our young people and the teachers in the nunavut territory are concerned about their salary deductions
that s the question i ve been hearing and i direct this question to minister of education
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr arvaluk minister of education
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i m very happy to respond to this question
on april 1st for the teachers and the staff at the schools deductions were transferred to the nunavut government from the government of the northwest territories
we have grandfathered the system from the gnwt during the transfer from the gnwt and there are not going to be any changes
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would also like to thank the minister of education for responding to my question but i have another question to the same minister because there s some employees out there who are confused
i would like to ask the minister if the teachers have had correspondence in regards to the deductions
for example in uqsuqtuuq i would like to see letters sent to the teachers and the employees of the schools on what system they re using whether they re using the same system that was used by the gnwt

oral questions mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu
interpretation
thank you mr speaker this question is for the minister of public works
when we were still under the government of the nwt some of the staff housing were sold and bought privately but these staff houses that were bought were not renovated
are there any plans to renovate the existing staff houses that were bought by the public
it caused quite a concern and some of the people who bought these old staff houses had some problems because the houses that were bought were very old
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the people who bought those houses knew that these houses were old
once they bought them they are no longer our responsibility and they become the responsibility of the people who bought them
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
oral questions mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
when the old staff houses were put up for sale they should have been renovated before they were sold
i don t know why they didn t do that and of course when they were bought they were no longer the responsibility of the government
i would suggest that if we re going to be selling the staff housing and any of the assets that we hold i would suggest that we renovate the housing or what ever assets that we re going to be selling
if we sell old buildings some of the people who buy these houses are not rich and it causes a problem it caused a problem
thank you mr speaker i would like this to be considered
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister of public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the staff housing that were put up for sale were very cheap
when you are buying housing you re talking about $250 thousand dollars to buy a house
the staff housing we sold were going much cheaper
for the smaller communities that don t have private homes i m sure the price tag seemed very high and if we re going to be selling staff housing after they ve been renovated i don t think that s a very good idea
we sold them as is
if we re going to be renovating before we sell them we re going to be using a lot more money out of our budget
the people who bought those houses now own those and they are no longer our responsibility

bill 2 - boards of management dissolution act
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
i was looking forward to this
mr speaker i move seconded by the member for pangnirtung bill 2 the boards of management dissolution act be read for the second time
mr speaker today i m introducing a piece of legislation entitled the boards of management dissolution act
this legislation allows the government to ensure a smooth transition over the next year as we work with boards towards the new health and social services for the people of nunavut
before i continue mr speaker i would like to take this opportunity to commend the trustees of our health and social services boards for their service over the years
the boards ensured that the people of nunavut played a role in their own affairs during the time as a minority in the northwest territories
but this is a new territory and a new day we have our own government now and we as residents of nunavut are well represented by the 19 mlas in this house
the decision to take a different approach in providing health and social services to nunavummiut has been guided by two important principles
first we want to be accountable we want to ensure that this government is responsible and responsive to the people of nunavut
we want to bring this government closer to the people we all represent and work directly with all our communities
second we want to be efficient
as we have already discussed publicly estimates show that we will be able to re-direct significant monies mr speaker into programs and services as a result of the impending decision
in short we want to ensure a nunavut based approach taking advantage of what our communities have in common while still taking into account their uniqueness
i want to point out mr speaker phasing out the boards will not affect the day to day delivery of programs and services to our clients in nunavut
the services provided by all health and social services workers in each region will continue to serve the public

bill 3 - divisional education councils dissolution act
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will be speaking in inuktitut but your interpreters have a copy
mr speaker it gives me a great deal of pleasure to stand before you today to introduce this piece of legislation entitled divisional education councils dissolution act
the school boards in nunavut now known as the divisional education councils were originally created to give the residents of the eastern arctic a voice in the government of the nwt
with nunavut that concern no longer exists
the responsibility for the delivery of these services will now be transferred to the elected leaders of the people of nunavut
all of us have a role in the important social function of educating our children
we envision an environment in which responsibilities and accountabilities are clearly defined beginning with a positive partnership between the student the parent and the teachers supported by a motivated and challenged community and district education authority
mr speaker education is a fundamental and important to the success of nunavut and this piece of legislation is a first step in building our new future in nunavut

weekend fire in iqaluit
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker a fire broke out in a six-apartment social housing unit in iqaluit early sunday morning despite the concerted efforts of the iqaluit fire department to save the unit the unit was totally destroyed
as a result 20 people are now homeless thanks to the iqaluit fire department we are fortunate that there were no serious injuries or loss of life
fires such as this are always tragic events
i want to extend my sympathy to those who lost their homes so suddenly over the weekend
i want to assure them that i will be working with the iqaluit housing authority and my colleagues to find alternate accommodations as quickly as possible

ministers statement 16 - 1 2
decentralization
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today to make something very clear to the members of this house and the people of nunavut
mr speaker the nunavut government is firmly committed to decentralization
our government was founded on the basis of bringing government closer to the people and make no mistake mr speaker we will do just that
we are proceeding with decentralization as we speak
in arviat the four employees of the department of education will soon be joined by twenty-three others
currently the department is in the process of advertising for these positions which will come on stream once the office space is available over the coming months
three staff from e department of community government housing & transportation are in place and two more will be out for competition shortly
the department of sustainable development has moved the four regional positions that were scheduled to be transferred into this community
mr speaker the residents of baker lake can rest assured that decentralization is moving ahead in their community
the department of education will soon be hiring four additional staff to complement those already on the ground
the department of community government housing & transportation currently has three of its baker lake positions out for competition and three more will be out before our next sitting
in igloolik the department of culture language elders & youth has six employees and they will soon be joined by approximately twenty more in the coming months
in addition one position from community government housing & transportation is out for competition
further west mr speaker cambridge bay has already begun to see the benefits of decentralization
positions in the departments of human resources and culture language elders & youth have been staffed
rankin inlet mr speaker also has begun the staffing process
employees in three departments are based there including two of our assistant deputy ministers
the department of health and social services is currently increasing its staffing level from nine to thirteen
one person has been hired from community government housing & transportation to work in gjoa haven and five more positions are currently out to competition
for kugluktuk two positions from the department of community government housing & transportation are staffed and three more are out to competition and will be filled during the next few months
all of the regional positions with the department of sustainable development except two have been moved into kugluktuk
one position from cape dorset is out for competition right now and six more will be advertised within the coming two months
mr speaker the communities of pond inlet and pangnirtung will soon be receiving jobs as they are transferred out of iqaluit
this process will take place over a varied time frame depending on departmental planning and infrastructure
these positions i have mentioned mr speaker are just the beginning
mr speaker the nunavut implementation commission and the office of the interim commissioner developed our basis for decentralization
as decentralization is an important issue that affects all departments the department of the executive has been assigned the difficult task of co-ordinating our decentralization efforts and ensuring that decentralization is implemented
and mr speaker this will be a difficult task
we are setting out to decentralize in a manner that no government in canada has ever done
we will decentralize but we must ensure that our programs and services to people in nunavut are not adversely affected
we must do this in a thoughtful well planned manner that allows communities to prepare for the inevitable social impacts
this mr speaker takes time
decentralization was never intended to take place overnight
we as cabinet understand the importance of decentralization to our communities
but it is important to realize that not all pieces of the puzzle are in place
our people are not fully trained to take many of the positions that will flow from decentralization
mr speaker in the coming weeks and months we will present to the regular mla s and the people of nunavut detailed implementation plans which will outline exactly how decentralization will be accomplished
in this house i mentioned that the department of the executive would be studying the options for implementing the decentralization plan
regular mla s will be involved in this process
mr speaker i thank those members who brought this issue to the forefront
we as cabinet look forward to working with them to ensure that community concerns are properly addressed
i am confident that if we all work together we will do what is right for nunavut

mr speaker i wish to thank the premier for his strong commitment and assurance that decentralization will take place in the smaller less fortunate communities in nunavut
mr speaker decentralization is the corner stone for a better quality of life for all the people in nunavut
these statements today by our premier take a heavy burden off our youth who are now seeing a ray of light and hope for future employment with the new of the government of nunavut

weekend fire in iqaluit
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to rise this afternoon to express my most sincere sympathies for the families who were so tragically rendered homeless on sunday in this community by a fire
i am gratified for the ministers response to this tragedy however this unhappy incident clearly demonstrates that contingency plans need to be in place to deal with incidents such as these
no one can predict when something like this will happen and while we should all be grateful nobody was killed or seriously injured the burden on these people is still tremendous
those iqalummiutait who have opened their hearts and their homes to the victims deserve our greatest respect

question 71 - 1 2
secondary school design for baker lake
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the minister of education regarding the jonah amitnak secondary school in baker lake that was built 1957 and added to in the 60 s
according to the current building codes it is not worth renovating and it s not up to standards
there was 300 hundred thousand put in the budget this year for designing a new school and i was advised by the baker lake district education authority that the project was scrapped this year
can the minister answer me as to why this project was scrapped this year

question 72 - 1 2
western premiers conference
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker in the premier s statement regarding the conference of western premiers the premier indicated that there was some discussion regarding a memorandum between the premiers which alluded to a road connection between nunavut and manitoba
i m wondering if the minister could elaborate a little more to i guess the discussions as related to the road and also the power grid that we spoke about a number of weeks ago between the keewatin and manitoba
speaker
qujannamiik mr o brien
premier okalik
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
the only agreement that was discussed was with the premier of the northwest territories and the government leader for the yukon government
speaker
interpretation thank you mr premier
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
i thought we heard the premier of manitoba just last night on the radio indicating that he strongly supported the road linkage between manitoba and the keewatin or nunavut
can the premier tell me whether or not these discussions took place and in what degree
thank you
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr o brien
our premier mr okalik
hon paul okalik
i discussed it briefly with the premier of manitoba he is a very strong supporter of a road to nunavut but we did not get into detailed discussions
i was more focused on getting support from all the premiers in western canada and that s what we received as a government from all the western premiers for a highway to nunavut from southern canada
speaker
interpretation thank you mr okalik
third question mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it s my understanding that there s been a committee active i guess for the last two years that was comprised of the gnwt and i believe the interim commissioner s office at that time and the manitoba government
they were basically put together to study a road linkage and power grid and the result is a study apparently finished sometime in march
i wonder if the premier is aware of any of the conclusions or the decisions that were made upon the completion of the report
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
the question was directed to the premier would you like to answer
hon paul okalik
the minister of transportation will be able to reply in more detail on that report
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr premier

final supplementary mr o brien
mr o brien

mr speaker i wonder if the minister will be so kind as to get a copy of the conclusions of the report so that we could have some active discussions on it in the house

question 73 - 1 2
government response to fire in iqaluit
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker this weekend the public housing inventory in iqaluit took a six unit hit as a result of a fire
the current waiting list is around 70 right now for public housing and as we just heard from the minister responsible for housing earlier there are now 20 more people that are homeless
i would like to ask the minister if there are any preliminary plans as a result of this prior to looking into replacing those units
thank you mr speaker
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
thank you mr speaker
but i can assure you that the department is doing everything it can to at least respond to the people who are left homeless but also in the long run to respond to the severe housing shortage

oral questions mr puqiqnak
question 74 - 1 2
repatriation of artifacts
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the minister of culture language elders and youth
mr speaker our nunavut fathers have had their pictures taken since the 1800 s by people from around the world who travelled here by whalers and other ships and somewhere in the 1900 s by dogteam
a lot of pictures have been taken since that time in the nunavut area and these artifacts are outside of canada and i believe that they should by rights be here in nunavut
i believe that there are many photographs that have been taken by the southerners i feel we should get all our artifacts and photographs and this should be a priority for the nunavut government
i believe that we must bring our artifacts and photographs which have been taken many many years ago back
these are part of our homeland and i am seeking an answer from the minister of culture language elders and youth about bringing all of these artifacts and photographs back to our homeland
thank you
speaker
