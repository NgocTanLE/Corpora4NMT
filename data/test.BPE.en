decentralization
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today to make something very clear to the members of this house and the people of nunavut
mr speaker the nunavut government is fir@@ m@@ ly committed to decentralization
our government was founded on the basis of bringing government closer to the people and make no mistake mr speaker we will do just that
we are proceeding with decentralization as we speak
in arviat the four employees of the department of education will soon be jo@@ in@@ ed by twenty-@@ three others
currently the department is in the process of adver@@ tising for these positions which will come on stre@@ am once the office space is available over the coming months
three staff from e department of community government housing & transportation are in place and two more will be out for competition shortly
the department of sustainable development has moved the four regional positions that were scheduled to be transferred into this community
mr speaker the residents of baker lake can rest as@@ sured that decentralization is moving ahead in their community
the department of education will soon be hiring four additional staff to comple@@ ment those already on the ground
the department of community government housing & transportation currently has three of its baker lake positions out for competition and three more will be out before our next sitting
in igloolik the department of culture language elders & youth has six employees and they will soon be jo@@ in@@ ed by approximately twenty more in the coming months
in addition one position from community government housing & transportation is out for competition
further west mr speaker cambridge bay has already be@@ gun to see the benefits of decentralization
positions in the departments of human resources and culture language elders & youth have been staffed
rankin inlet mr speaker also has be@@ gun the staffing process
employees in three departments are based there including two of our assistant deputy ministers
the department of health and social services is currently increasing its staffing level from nine to th@@ ir@@ teen
one person has been hired from community government housing & transportation to work in gjoa haven and five more positions are currently out to competition
for kugluktuk two positions from the department of community government housing & transportation are staffed and three more are out to competition and will be filled during the next few months
all of the regional positions with the department of sustainable development excep@@ t two have been moved into kugluktuk
one position from cape dorset is out for competition right now and six more will be adver@@ ti@@ sed within the coming two months
mr speaker the communities of pond inlet and pangnirtung will soon be receiving jobs as they are transferred out of iqaluit
this process will take place over a vari@@ ed time frame depen@@ ding on departmental planning and infrastructure
these positions i have mentioned mr speaker are just the beginning
mr speaker the nunavut implementation commission and the office of the interim commissioner developed our basis for decentralization
as decentralization is an important issue that affects all departments the department of the executive has been assigned the difficult task of co-ordin@@ ating our decentralization efforts and ensuring that decentralization is implemented
and mr speaker this will be a difficult task
we are setting out to de@@ cen@@ tra@@ li@@ ze in a manner that no government in canada has ever done
we will de@@ cen@@ tra@@ li@@ ze but we must ensure that our programs and services to people in nunavut are not adver@@ sely aff@@ ec@@ ted
we must do this in a th@@ ou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful well planned manner that allows communities to pre@@ p@@ are for the in@@ e@@ vi@@ table social imp@@ ac@@ ts
this mr speaker takes time
decentralization was never intended to take place over@@ night
we as cabinet understand the importance of decentralization to our communities
but it is important to realize that not all pie@@ ces of the p@@ u@@ zz@@ le are in place
our people are not fully trained to take many of the positions that will flo@@ w from decentralization
mr speaker in the coming weeks and months we will present to the regular mla s and the people of nunavut detailed implementation plans which will outline exactly how decentralization will be accomplished
in this house i mentioned that the department of the executive would be stud@@ ying the options for implementing the decentralization plan
regular mla s will be involved in this process
mr speaker i thank those members who brought this issue to the fo@@ re@@ f@@ ron@@ t
we as cabinet look forward to working with them to ensure that community concerns are properly addressed
i am confident that if we all work together we will do what is right for nunavut

western premiers conference
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker in the premier s statement regarding the conference of western premiers the premier indicated that there was some discussion regarding a memorandum between the premiers which alluded to a road con@@ ne@@ ction between nunavut and man@@ it@@ ob@@ a
i m wondering if the minister could elaborate a little more to i guess the discussions as related to the road and also the power gri@@ d that we spoke about a number of weeks ago between the keewatin and man@@ it@@ ob@@ a

i thought we heard the premier of man@@ it@@ ob@@ a just last night on the radio indi@@ cating that he str@@ ong@@ ly supported the road lin@@ k@@ age between man@@ it@@ ob@@ a and the keewatin or nunavut
can the premier tell me whether or not these discussions took place and in what degree

interpretation
thank you mr o brien
our premier mr okalik
hon paul okalik
i discus@@ sed it briefly with the premier of man@@ it@@ ob@@ a he is a very strong suppor@@ ter of a road to nunavut but we did not get into detailed discussions
i was more fo@@ cu@@ sed on getting support from all the premiers in western canada and that s what we received as a government from all the western premiers for a highway to nunavut from southern canada
speaker
interpretation thank you mr okalik
third question mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it s my understanding that there s been a committee ac@@ tive i guess for the last two years that was compri@@ sed of the gnwt and i believe the interim commissioner s office at that time and the man@@ it@@ ob@@ a government
they were basically put together to study a road lin@@ k@@ age and power gri@@ d and the result is a study ap@@ par@@ ently finished sometime in march
i wonder if the premier is aware of any of the conclu@@ sions or the decisions that were made upon the comple@@ tion of the report
thank you

question 7@@ 4 - 1 2
repatri@@ ation of artifacts
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the minister of culture language elders and youth
mr speaker our nunavut fa@@ thers have had their pic@@ tures taken since the 1@@ 8@@ 00 s by people from around the world who travelled here by wh@@ al@@ ers and other ships and somewhere in the 1@@ 9@@ 00 s by do@@ g@@ team
a lot of pic@@ tures have been taken since that time in the nunavut area and these artifacts are outside of canada and i believe that they should by rights be here in nunavut
i believe that there are many p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s that have been taken by the sou@@ ther@@ ners i feel we should get all our artifacts and p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s and this should be a priority for the nunavut government
i believe that we must bring our artifacts and p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s which have been taken many many years ago back
these are part of our ho@@ mel@@ and and i am seeking an answer from the minister of culture language elders and youth about bringing all of these artifacts and p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s back to our ho@@ mel@@ and
thank you
speaker
