weekend fire in iqaluit
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker a fire broke out in a six-apartment social housing unit in iqaluit early sunday morning despite the concerted efforts of the iqaluit fire department to save the unit the unit was totally destroyed
as a result 20 people are now homeless thanks to the iqaluit fire department we are fortunate that there were no serious injuries or loss of life
fires such as this are always tragic events
i want to extend my sympathy to those who lost their homes so suddenly over the weekend
i want to assure them that i will be working with the iqaluit housing authority and my colleagues to find alternate accommodations as quickly as possible

decentralization
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today to make something very clear to the members of this house and the people of nunavut
mr speaker the nunavut government is firmly committed to decentralization
our government was founded on the basis of bringing government closer to the people and make no mistake mr speaker we will do just that
we are proceeding with decentralization as we speak
in arviat the four employees of the department of education will soon be joined by twenty-three others
currently the department is in the process of advertising for these positions which will come on stream once the office space is available over the coming months
three staff from e department of community government housing & transportation are in place and two more will be out for competition shortly
the department of sustainable development has moved the four regional positions that were scheduled to be transferred into this community
mr speaker the residents of baker lake can rest assured that decentralization is moving ahead in their community
the department of education will soon be hiring four additional staff to complement those already on the ground
the department of community government housing & transportation currently has three of its baker lake positions out for competition and three more will be out before our next sitting
in igloolik the department of culture language elders & youth has six employees and they will soon be joined by approximately twenty more in the coming months
in addition one position from community government housing & transportation is out for competition
further west mr speaker cambridge bay has already begun to see the benefits of decentralization
positions in the departments of human resources and culture language elders & youth have been staffed
rankin inlet mr speaker also has begun the staffing process
employees in three departments are based there including two of our assistant deputy ministers
the department of health and social services is currently increasing its staffing level from nine to thirteen
one person has been hired from community government housing & transportation to work in gjoa haven and five more positions are currently out to competition
for kugluktuk two positions from the department of community government housing & transportation are staffed and three more are out to competition and will be filled during the next few months
all of the regional positions with the department of sustainable development except two have been moved into kugluktuk
one position from cape dorset is out for competition right now and six more will be advertised within the coming two months
mr speaker the communities of pond inlet and pangnirtung will soon be receiving jobs as they are transferred out of iqaluit
this process will take place over a varied time frame depending on departmental planning and infrastructure
these positions i have mentioned mr speaker are just the beginning
mr speaker the nunavut implementation commission and the office of the interim commissioner developed our basis for decentralization
as decentralization is an important issue that affects all departments the department of the executive has been assigned the difficult task of co-ordinating our decentralization efforts and ensuring that decentralization is implemented
and mr speaker this will be a difficult task
we are setting out to decentralize in a manner that no government in canada has ever done
we will decentralize but we must ensure that our programs and services to people in nunavut are not adversely affected
we must do this in a thoughtful well planned manner that allows communities to prepare for the inevitable social impacts
this mr speaker takes time
decentralization was never intended to take place overnight
we as cabinet understand the importance of decentralization to our communities
but it is important to realize that not all pieces of the puzzle are in place
our people are not fully trained to take many of the positions that will flow from decentralization
mr speaker in the coming weeks and months we will present to the regular mla s and the people of nunavut detailed implementation plans which will outline exactly how decentralization will be accomplished
in this house i mentioned that the department of the executive would be studying the options for implementing the decentralization plan
regular mla s will be involved in this process
mr speaker i thank those members who brought this issue to the forefront
we as cabinet look forward to working with them to ensure that community concerns are properly addressed
i am confident that if we all work together we will do what is right for nunavut

weekend fire in iqaluit
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to rise this afternoon to express my most sincere sympathies for the families who were so tragically rendered homeless on sunday in this community by a fire
i am gratified for the ministers response to this tragedy however this unhappy incident clearly demonstrates that contingency plans need to be in place to deal with incidents such as these
no one can predict when something like this will happen and while we should all be grateful nobody was killed or seriously injured the burden on these people is still tremendous
those iqalummiutait who have opened their hearts and their homes to the victims deserve our greatest respect

secondary school design for baker lake
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the minister of education regarding the jonah amitnak secondary school in baker lake that was built 1957 and added to in the 60 s
according to the current building codes it is not worth renovating and it s not up to standards
there was 300 hundred thousand put in the budget this year for designing a new school and i was advised by the baker lake district education authority that the project was scrapped this year
can the minister answer me as to why this project was scrapped this year

question 72 - 1 2
western premiers conference
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker in the premier s statement regarding the conference of western premiers the premier indicated that there was some discussion regarding a memorandum between the premiers which alluded to a road connection between nunavut and manitoba
i m wondering if the minister could elaborate a little more to i guess the discussions as related to the road and also the power grid that we spoke about a number of weeks ago between the keewatin and manitoba
speaker

premier okalik
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
the only agreement that was discussed was with the premier of the northwest territories and the government leader for the yukon government
speaker
interpretation thank you mr premier
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
i thought we heard the premier of manitoba just last night on the radio indicating that he strongly supported the road linkage between manitoba and the keewatin or nunavut
can the premier tell me whether or not these discussions took place and in what degree
thank you
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr o brien
our premier mr okalik
hon paul okalik
i discussed it briefly with the premier of manitoba he is a very strong supporter of a road to nunavut but we did not get into detailed discussions
i was more focused on getting support from all the premiers in western canada and that s what we received as a government from all the western premiers for a highway to nunavut from southern canada
speaker
interpretation thank you mr okalik
third question mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it s my understanding that there s been a committee active i guess for the last two years that was comprised of the gnwt and i believe the interim commissioner s office at that time and the manitoba government
they were basically put together to study a road linkage and power grid and the result is a study apparently finished sometime in march
i wonder if the premier is aware of any of the conclusions or the decisions that were made upon the completion of the report
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
the question was directed to the premier would you like to answer
hon paul okalik
the minister of transportation will be able to reply in more detail on that report

government response to fire in iqaluit
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker this weekend the public housing inventory in iqaluit took a six unit hit as a result of a fire
the current waiting list is around 70 right now for public housing and as we just heard from the minister responsible for housing earlier there are now 20 more people that are homeless
i would like to ask the minister if there are any preliminary plans as a result of this prior to looking into replacing those units
thank you mr speaker
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
thank you mr speaker
but i can assure you that the department is doing everything it can to at least respond to the people who are left homeless but also in the long run to respond to the severe housing shortage

question 74 - 1 2
repatriation of artifacts
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the minister of culture language elders and youth
mr speaker our nunavut fathers have had their pictures taken since the 1800 s by people from around the world who travelled here by whalers and other ships and somewhere in the 1900 s by dogteam
a lot of pictures have been taken since that time in the nunavut area and these artifacts are outside of canada and i believe that they should by rights be here in nunavut
i believe that there are many photographs that have been taken by the southerners i feel we should get all our artifacts and photographs and this should be a priority for the nunavut government
i believe that we must bring our artifacts and photographs which have been taken many many years ago back
these are part of our homeland and i am seeking an answer from the minister of culture language elders and youth about bringing all of these artifacts and photographs back to our homeland
thank you
speaker
