bill 2 - boards of management dissolution act
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
i was looking forward to this
mr speaker i move seconded by the member for pangnirtung bill 2 the boards of management dissolution act be read for the second time
mr speaker today i m introducing a piece of legislation entitled the boards of management dissolution act
this legislation allows the government to ensure a smooth transition over the next year as we work with boards towards the new health and social services for the people of nunavut
before i continue mr speaker i would like to take this opportunity to commend the trustees of our health and social services boards for their service over the years
the boards ensured that the people of nunavut played a role in their own affairs during the time as a minority in the northwest territories
but this is a new territory and a new day we have our own government now and we as residents of nunavut are well represented by the 19 mlas in this house
the decision to take a different approach in providing health and social services to nunavummiut has been guided by two important principles
first we want to be accountable we want to ensure that this government is responsible and responsive to the people of nunavut
we want to bring this government closer to the people we all represent and work directly with all our communities
second we want to be efficient
as we have already discussed publicly estimates show that we will be able to re-direct significant monies mr speaker into programs and services as a result of the impending decision
in short we want to ensure a nunavut based approach taking advantage of what our communities have in common while still taking into account their uniqueness
i want to point out mr speaker phasing out the boards will not affect the day to day delivery of programs and services to our clients in nunavut
the services provided by all health and social services workers in each region will continue to serve the public
i would like to express my appreciation to all the health and social services care providers administrative and support staff in our communities in nunavut
these people are the heart for health and social services in nunavut
we all rely on them and i want to promise them that over the coming year i will devote myself to ensuring a stable and smooth transition
mr speaker i have instructed my officials at the department that we will work collaboratively with the boards as we develop an implementation plan
i ve also committed to the standing committee on culture education and health that they will have an implementation plan completed by september of this year
mr speaker to adopt a new direction for health and social services in nunavut

bill 3 - divisional education councils dissolution act
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will be speaking in inuktitut but your interpreters have a copy
mr speaker it gives me a great deal of pleasure to stand before you today to introduce this piece of legislation entitled divisional education councils dissolution act
the school boards in nunavut now known as the divisional education councils were originally created to give the residents of the eastern arctic a voice in the government of the nwt
with nunavut that concern no longer exists
the responsibility for the delivery of these services will now be transferred to the elected leaders of the people of nunavut
all of us have a role in the important social function of educating our children
we envision an environment in which responsibilities and accountabilities are clearly defined beginning with a positive partnership between the student the parent and the teachers supported by a motivated and challenged community and district education authority
mr speaker education is a fundamental and important to the success of nunavut and this piece of legislation is a first step in building our new future in nunavut
