hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
good afternoon , nunavummiut and residents of my community .
mr. speaker , this past september the qulliq energy corporation completed the construction and testing of a new power plant in the community of taloyoak .
i am pleased to rise today to announce that the energy corporation is continuing to take strides toward their long @-@ term plan to rebuild and modernize nunavut &apos;s aging infrastructure with the completion of the corporation &apos;s newest power plant in qikiqtarjuaq .
the new power plant has been in full operation since december 2016 and replaced one of the oldest power plants in the territory .
( interpretation ends ) a reliable supply of electricity is critical to all nunavummiut . qikiqtarjuaq &apos;s new plant will ensure that the community will have a source of power they can rely on for decades to come .
( interpretation ) the new plant &apos;s environmental benefits include a reduction in carbon emissions and less sound pollution due to the installation of four new fuel @-@ efficient generator sets as well as a hospital grade silencer .
in addition , the plant &apos;s new design can accommodate community expansion and already allows for the integration of renewable energy systems , such as solar and wind energy systems .
mr. speaker , the energy corporation is committed to supplying nunavummiut with dependable and affordable energy while actively seeking opportunities to move our territory towards a clean and sustainable energy future .
our priority is to rebuild our infrastructure to provide more reliable power while also opening new doors that allow for renewable energy systems to be developed in nunavut today .
on behalf of the energy corporation , i would like to extend my gratitude to the residents of qikiqtarjuaq for their support throughout the construction of the community &apos;s new power plant .
i look forward to celebrating the new power plant with residents and officials of qikiqtarjuaq with a grand opening and community feast in late march .

the aim of this series is to inspire conversation about what it means to be safe in a world that is rapidly evolving .
in september of 2016 the department of justice took part in the filming of an episode for this eight @-@ part cbc series . in the nunavut episode , the film crew went on an overnight trip with the corrections division cultural skills program team and three low @-@ risk incarcerated nunavummiut .
the film highlights nunavut &apos;s unique program that is provided to incarcerated individuals , who are given the opportunity to learn traditional skills and share knowledge on the land , which will assist them with their successful reintegration back into our communities .
the nunavut segment is scheduled to air on april 6 , 2017 on cbc at 9 : 00 p.m. eastern .
i encourage my colleagues here in the house and all nunavummiut to tune in to see some of the good work being done by the corrections division and our inmates .

hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) i rise today to respond to a statement that nunavut tunngavik incorporated released shortly after the introduction of bill 37 , an act to amend the education act and the inuit language protection act .
mr. speaker , this government is taking concrete action on language revitalization and student outcomes .
the amendments in bill 37 ensure the consistent delivery of inuktitut as the language of instruction , even where there are a limited number of bilingual teachers .
consistency will improve program delivery , resource development , assessments , and teacher training .
mr. speaker , i have ordered a review of the nunavut teacher education program that will focus on increasing the number of inuktut teachers and content teachers .
further , my department and nunavut arctic college are designing new programs to increase inuit employment and to expand the use of inuktut in our schools .
we are collaborating with nti on an updated inuit employment plan for educators .
mr. speaker , we have launched the first ever inuktut guided reading system . we have already produced over 300 books and teaching guides and we will be providing more books as planned .
some of these books were on display in the foyer on march 2 .
mr. speaker , we have made great progress in developing new curriculum and resources to support language development .
mr. speaker , taking action to prevent language loss is the responsibility we all share .
efforts must be made at home with parents and the difficult work to standardize inuktitut must begin now .
we must establish a standardized writing system and a standardized vocabulary as building blocks to making inuktut the first language of schools , government , and businesses in nunavut .
mr. speaker , fellow members , and citizens of nunavut , let us all work together to make inuktut a vehicle for social , cultural and economic revitalization in nunavut .

hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) i rise in the house today to inform my fellow members of the progress of sanatuliqsarvik , the nunavut mining and trades training centre located in rankin inlet .
nunavut arctic college has consulted with industry and identified a need to deliver an introduction to underground mining program and an underground mining program .
this will benefit nunavummiut greatly as current careers in underground mining require the training and more careers will be developed in the coming years .
the college &apos;s first introduction to underground mining program was successfully delivered in october 2016 . this program was sponsored by the kivalliq mine training society , yet delivered by nunavut arctic college at the sanatuliqsarvik mining and trades training centre in rankin inlet .
there were seven successful students .
our second delivery of the introduction to underground mining program is currently being delivered in rankin inlet , also sponsored by the kivalliq mine training society .
in september of 2016 nunavut arctic college did not possess curriculum for the underground mining training program . however , the college has now partnered with aurora college in the northwest territories to obtain the course materials and to offer these courses .
moving forward , the college plans to further adapt our underground mining programs to nunavut industry standards .
i am pleased to announce that our college has consulted with representatives from the mining industry , such as agnico eagle .
as employers , they have offered to provide nunavut arctic college with subject matter experts who will review and adapt our curriculum as necessary and to ensure that we meet the employability requirements of their industry and nunavut &apos;s specific mining regulations .

member &apos;s statement 536 - 4 ( 3 ) : recognizing jenna kilabuk of pangnirtung ( okalik )
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i believe most of my colleagues are aware that i take extreme gratification in being an inuk . i recall links to my skilled ancestor who survived many challenges that they overcame , which is why we can stand here today expressing our collective cultural history , which is definitely a strength of our culture that we have to re @-@ acknowledge .
i rise today to recognize the accomplishments of my cousin , geela sowdluapik , and her grandchild , who is jenna kilabuk .
jenna is reaching adulthood in my old stomping grounds of pangnirtung where she resides today . nonetheless , all of our relatives take pride in her accomplishments irrespective of our age , adult or youth . furthermore , she is a daughter of rosie and peter kilabuk , who is no stranger to our legislative assembly .
jenna herself has promoted a healthy lifestyle that one wishes to follow and inspires others , as she is very dedicated in her desire to attain lifelong learning .
she took it upon herself to attend courses in belleville as well as ottawa , as she wanted to be a physical education teacher .
today she has accomplished her goal of being a teacher .
when she has the time , she also sets asides nights to residents who wish to partake in volleyball or badminton activities .
even prior to her assuming an employment position , she was active in our local community youth representation to ensure more support was derived to her fellow citizens .
she was instrumental in organizing local christmas games .
she was acknowledged in 2008 with an aboriginal role model award where she exhibited many of the skills the judges were searching for , to portray successful role models .
she is not solely responsible for her accomplishments , but she still exemplifies the many qualities of a role model .
although she is very young , she now owns her own private home , and she was elected to the local hamlet council .
mr. speaker , i wish to especially single her out as an example of successful young inuit who have accomplished much , but in terms of her success as an example of encouragement leading to an inuk &apos;s perseverance that leads to personal success in their lives .
thank you , mr. speaker .

ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
good afternoon , everyone .
mr. speaker , as you will recall , exactly one year ago today i moved motion 23 - 4 ( 3 ) , seconded by my colleague from quttiktuq , calling on the government to address the needs of elders .
mr. speaker , yesterday the premier tabled the government &apos;s strategic framework : addressing the needs of nunavut seniors .
this is a step in the right direction towards fulfilling the intent of that motion .
mr. speaker , this document is a review of the various programs and services that are available for seniors and identifies some important restructuring of service delivery that will take place in the upcoming fiscal year .
mr. speaker , consolidating residential care for elders under the department of health will allow the department of family services the opportunity to more effectively address the troubling issue of elder abuse . this move will also allow the department of health to realistically assess and plan for the growing need for residential services for elders across nunavut .
mr. speaker , the government &apos;s 2015 continuing care in nunavut document recommended that the government increase the capacity of residential long @-@ term care in nunavut .
while i do appreciate that seven more beds are being opened at the cambridge bay health facility for long @-@ term care and respite and palliative care , much more needs to be done to keep more of our elders at home in nunavut , receiving care near their families and communities .
mr. speaker , it is critical that the government continue to address the need for consistent and ongoing support for seniors in nunavut .
yesterday &apos;s tabled documents are small steps forward and i look forward to seeing more in the future .
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. tom sammurtok ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) i rise today to offer some reflections on the occasion of the 150th year of confederation .
mr. speaker , earlier in this sitting i made a statement about the wonderful qajaq program in chesterfield inlet . as members will recall , i noted how this program combines modern technology and traditional skills in a way that fosters intergenerational and intercultural learning .
mr. speaker , it has been said that our country is a work in progress . here in nunavut we continue our journey towards healing and reconciliation .
the dog slaughters , high arctic relocations , and residential school abuses have left a painful legacy , and we must acknowledge that there are still unresolved issues today that manifest themselves in such tragic ways as suicide and abuse .
however , i do believe that these can be overcome .
mr. speaker , it has also been said that the &quot; world needs more canada . &quot;
i say that this is true , and i also say that canada needs more nunavut .
mr. speaker , during this sitting i have also raised such issues as the importance of finally connecting nunavut to the rest of the nation by way of road .
after a century and a half of existence , our country &apos;s single largest jurisdiction should not remain so isolated and i look forward to real progress being made on the nation @-@ building manitoba @-@ kivalliq road project .
mr. speaker , an anniversary such as the one we are marking this year calls for both reflection and anticipation .
it is essential that we reflect honestly on both the positive and negative aspects of our history .
by doing so , we make reconciliation possible .
mr. speaker , i seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
the member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement . are there any nays ?
there are none . mr. tom sammurtok , please proceed .
mr. tom sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker . i thank my colleagues .
it is also essential that we look forward to the future in a way that puts the interests of our children and our children &apos;s children first .
mr. speaker , the qajaq program at victor sammurtok school in chesterfield inlet symbolizes what is best about our nation , and i ask all members to join me today in reflecting on this important anniversary .

member &apos;s statement 540 - 4 ( 3 ) : nunavut quest 2017 - pangaggujjiniq ( shooyook )
mr. shooyook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today on a calmer issue , albeit very happily to announce an event that is not so concerning .
the nunavut quest will be commencing their annual husky dog races in arctic bay on april 15 . they will leave from arctic bay to their destination .
mr. speaker , back in the days when the dog slaughter occurred , many communities lost their entire dog genetic pool and had no more dog teams .
the nunavut quest was started to commemorate the eskimo husky dog .
with many dog team owners today , it is a cause for cultural pride .
today i am informing my colleagues and inviting them , starting today , if you wish to observe the beginning of the race , start saving your money towards an airplane ticket to travel to arctic bay , provided any of the members wanted to do so .
the start of this dog racing event is particularly spectacular when you see a whole bunch of dog teams , with dogs yelping and antsy to get going .
this is also the case when they start to arrive into the destination community .
the community welcoming the dog teams is always very ecstatic to receive them .
the older generation becomes quite nostalgic and many elders become very emotional seeing the huskies , so similar to the dogs they grew up with being the cause of this celebration .
this is absolutely critical both to nunavut and inuit culturally .
the nunavut quest will be commencing their race in arctic bay . this race has been running for a number of years .
we will again celebrate this unique racing event as residents of arctic bay .
if anyone wishes to observe the race , i again invite all members and as the mla for quttiktuq , i warmly welcome all other residents of our communities to travel to observe the start of this race .
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. speaker , i rise today to express my appreciation . as we are all aware , cape dorset lost its school almost two years ago now .
after this tragic event , nonetheless , i stated that our education at the community would be delayed but that it would not stop . education will continue and i want to state this for the benefit of the people in kugaaruk
however , at the time the students were able to continue their education . last year in 2016 some students were scheduled for graduation after that school year , but this celebration will finally commence next week .

member &apos;s statement 542 - 4 ( 3 ) : update on the pangnirtung fishery ( mike )
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to speak to the local efforts of pangnirtung to derive income from our marine environment and in particular their turbot fishery .
this fishery has been running for over 25 years with the commercial fishing industry .
the turbot fishery in particular is where pangnirtung residents are heavily involved in , both offshore and inshore fisheries , to derive income from the commercial quota in place .
i also want to mention the pangnirtung fishermen who provide freshly caught turbot to people who want to buy turbot . the turbot fishermen comprise the majority of the winter fishery and they provide freshly caught turbot to the markets .
last year they harvested over 700,000 lbs. of turbot , shipped all over the world from our community of pangnirtung .
further , this fishery is in the only jurisdiction currently in canada that provides fresh turbot , at least as far as we know , during the frigid winter .
in the fish plant there are over 30 employees currently and there are 45 licensed fishermen for turbot .
to date , after the winter fishery commenced last month , they have harvested close to 300,000 lbs. processed at the plant .
as well , the fishermen have generated over $ 340,000 and this is very beneficial to the community and in particular to residents who are not employed but who derive employment from the fishery , as it allows the continuation of our traditional winter activities .
the fishery started in pangnirtung , obviously using our traditional knowledge about whaling , beluga blubber and skin processing , fur trapping , as well as ring and harp sealskin sales .
this comprises a large part of our present marine resource extraction .
i was quite pleased to hear about the pilot project in pond inlet , which was very successful with plentiful turbot .
this is very pleasing to hear and i encourage communities to undertake initiatives like that .

hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . good day to the residents of my community .
we see many people who don &apos;t have enough to eat in our communities and there are food banks now that are opening up in our communities .
i want my colleagues to help me in expressing gratitude to those people who create these initiatives to help other people .
there is a food bank in igloolik and i &apos;m very proud of it because the people who run it think more along the lines of traditional inuit food and to have inuit food available . they have tried that .
the people who run the food bank do fundraising so that some of the money can be used to help hunters and the hunters will bring back the food that can be distributed through the food bank to the needy people .
i &apos;m very proud of the fact in igloolik that they are trying to go after traditional inuit food for these people who generally don &apos;t have enough food in their homes , trying to see how they can get food for them .
i am very proud of them .
these food banks where people go and get food really help the communities . let &apos;s support them and be thankful for them because they are trying to help fellow people .
that &apos;s why i rose here today .

when we meet at this time of the year , it tends to be a very long session and there are very long hours that have been put in and a lot of hard work .
i would like to acknowledge the work of the staff . people who watch us on tv hopefully realize how hard of an effort we &apos;re putting in , but they also don &apos;t see all the staff behind us that are working around in the long hours that we put in .
i would like to take this opportunity to especially acknowledge all of our families .
i know there were a number of comments made during international women &apos;s day , but i would like to again just make special note .
when we &apos;re here working these long hours , it &apos;s our families , communities , and constituents that are helping keep our communities and keeping our activities relevant to what we &apos;re trying to accomplish here .

return to oral question 673 - 4 ( 3 ) : environmental assessment by nunavut impact review board ( ell @-@ kanayuk )
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk : thank you , mr. speaker .
this is a return to an oral question asked by pauloosie keyootak , mla for uqqummiut , on march 8 , 2017 , no. 673 - 4 ( 3 ) , on the environmental assessment by the nunavut impact review board .
question :
thank you , mr. chairman .
the nunavut impact review board &apos;s announcement indicated that &quot; public engagement sessions &quot; will be held in a number of communities , including clyde river and qikiqtarjuaq .
it also indicated that &quot; a final public meeting and community roundtable will be facilitated by nirb in iqaluit .
for the record , can the minister confirm which organization is responsible for providing support to communities during the consultation process ?
answer :
mr. speaker , the government of nunavut is a partner in the strategic environmental assessments administered by the nunavut impact review board .
this assessment concerns the future development of oil and gas related activities in the baffin bay and davis strait area .
the department of economic development and transportation is an active participant in the strategic environmental assessment working group .
its role is to support the study process , with a focus on the public education component of sea and ensuring that nunavummiut are well informed on this issue .

item 6 : oral questions
question 699 - 4 ( 3 ) : senate reform ( okalik )
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is for the minister of executive and intergovernmental affairs .
the current occupant of nunavut &apos;s senate seat is on record as having stated that he would resign his position after having sat in the senate for eight years .
that deadline is fast approaching .
my question for the minister is simple : does the nunavut government support the holding of an election to fill nunavut &apos;s senate seat , yes or no ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
premier of nunavut , mr. taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the member for that question .
mr. speaker , i went through that tabled document and from 2009 that &apos;s what the newly appointed senator had indicated . he was there for eight years on the expectation that the prime minister may change legislation and have the senator stay for eight years , then go on to elections .
as far as i understand , i have no correspondence , no indication , or no phone call from the prime minister at this point , so i can &apos;t speak on something i have no authority over ; it &apos;s a federal appointee .
once i get a good understanding of what may happen ... . as far as i know , there is no legislation change for an election .
mr. speaker , i do know that there has to be consensus from all jurisdictions , at least seven jurisdictions , to change the senate legislation .
in the past it was called senate reform .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. okalik .
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
even though that &apos;s the case , there was one election outside of the territory and as a consequence there was one individual that was appointed to a senate seat .
we want to be represented properly in the senate and we would like to elect a true nunavummiuq to that seat .
i very much would like the minister to lobby the federal government to appoint a new member elected by nunavummiut for that seat on the senate .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. premier of nunavut , hon. mr. taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
as i indicated , this is a federal jurisdiction and if the member is willing to find out if there are going to be any changes in the legislation , anybody in nunavut , including people from the south , has the authority to write to the prime minister or to our mp to see what the next steps are going to be .
at this point i haven &apos;t had any indication , any correspondence , or any phone calls about what the status of senators &quot; seats may be .
as you know , mr. speaker , there are nine new senators that were appointed at that time and i believe most of them had indicated that they are willing to step aside if legislation is approved by all jurisdictions for eight @-@ year terms moving on to elections .
if there are any indications from this house that there &apos;s a wish for an election process for senators for nunavut seats , we will certainly investigate that possibility .
at this time anybody here is free to write to the mp to find out what the processes are and what the prime minister is thinking .
in my next conversation with the prime minister , i will certainly bring that issue out and having that discussion on where his party stands on senate reform .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. okalik .
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i believe we need to improve the process we use nowadays because the senator who represents nunavut , for instance , is very quick to put down inuit organizations .
most recently a senator from his own party stated that the old residential school system was &quot; well intentioned . &quot;
even though the senator of nunavut heard about that , he didn &apos;t rebut that statement .
it seems like he is not representing us in nunavut .
nunavut deserves its own senate representative strengthened by general election .
can the premier lobby to get this long overdue change made ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
premier of nunavut , mr. peter taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate the member &apos;s question .
mr. speaker , as a young territory we try to engage our federal partners in making sure that our concerns are heard , and this is no exception .
this is an appointed position by the prime minister by the previous government and i had no say in selecting or even appointing the senators .
mr. speaker , if i do have a conversation with the prime minister , i will certainly bring that out because for the most part we do have to change our legislation , our nunavut elections act , to fall into place with whatever legislation that the federal government may put in place for senate reform .
i haven &apos;t had any indications or correspondence , but at the very next opportunity i &apos;ll certainly bring that concern out .
again i &apos;ve got to state that every nunavummiuq has that opportunity to write to their mp on such concerns to bring forth how the process may be done to make nunavut better , not only nunavut , but people of nunavut .
you &apos;ve got to understand that there are efforts being made from all sides . there may be some disagreements here and there , but at the end of the day we will certainly do our part to make sure that whatever happens within the federal government , we are consulted .

question 700 - 4 ( 3 ) : fur auction house ( keyootak )
mr. keyootak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of environment .
mr. speaker , during our session last fall i was asking questions in regard to the fur auction house .
hunters who have been sending out furs , especially polar bear hides , have been waiting for years .
i have been asking questions in regard to when the next auction would be .
have you heard when the next auction date is or did they not have one this year ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of environment , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
the polar bear hides that are old were bought overpriced and have not been sold . the newer hides have been priced at a lower rate and they are being bought .
the polar bear hides that are collected down at the auction house are actually depleting . that is how it is right now .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. keyootak .
mr. keyootak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
is it impossible at this time to know when the next auction will be ? although i know that this is not the minister &apos;s jurisdiction , i would like to ask the minister if he has heard when the next fur auction will take place .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of environment , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t have the information as to when the next auction will take place , but it is supposed to be in the spring .
however , the polar bear hides at the auction house can be bought at any time of the year .
any person can go there and purchase a polar bear hide if the price is good for them .
the polar bear hides that are not being purchased are because they are too expensive . at the time that the polar bear hides were purchased , the price was high and the department purchased them from the hunters .
we gave half the price to the harvesters in advance and when the prices of polar bear hides went down , the money that was given to the harvesters became too expensive . that is why the polar bears are not being purchased at this time .
however , there will be a fur auction this coming spring .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. keyootak .
mr. keyootak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
the hunters who have sent their hides , i am not too sure , but the majority had been given an advance for the polar bear hides given to the department . if the polar bear hide is sold , then they get that part of the money given to them .
that was probably the case for some of them when the price of the fur was high .
what would happen if the polar bear hides cannot be purchased ? would they have to be returned to the hunters themselves and they would end up owing money because of the advance they received ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of environment , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
if the individuals who have polar bear hides wanted to get their polar bear hide back , then they would have to pay the advance back to the government .
however , if the individual does not want the hide , then they would leave the polar bear hide in the auction house without owing money as the government had purchased it .
if the harvester agrees that the government can purchase the polar bear hide at a full price and if the polar bear hide remains at the auction house , then they wouldn &apos;t owe money for their advance .
however , if they want to get their polar bear hide back , they have to pay back the advance that they had received in the past .

question 701 - 4 ( 3 ) : pre @-@ dissolution priorities ( angnakak )
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker . my questions are also for the premier .
mr. speaker , the current legislative assembly will be dissolved in a little over six months from now and nunavummiut will soon be rendering their judgment on all of us .
can the premier indicate what the government &apos;s top priorities are for its last six months in the office ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
the hon. premier of nunavut , mr. peter taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate the question from the member .
mr. speaker , we have many priorities , but of course together we formed our number one priority with nunavut tunngavik incorporated with their board and we met with the board members on a couple of occasions . we met together to come up with our mandate , sivumut abluqta . that &apos;s still our priority .
mr. speaker , as you know , there were a lot of setbacks within our term here . we had three major fires . we had two schools and the power plant .
that slowed things down , but our priority for the next six months is to try to complete the mandate that we have agreed together as one to try to complete the status for the benefit of nunavummiut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
can the premier indicate what he believes to have been the government &apos;s three most important achievements over the last four years ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker : the hon. premier of nunavut , hon. peter taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
again i thank the member for that question .
mr. speaker , there have been many achievements we have done through this government .
as you know , in the early days through legislation we were required to review the education act .
that &apos;s where we initially formed the special committee to review the education act .
that was one of the biggest priorities .
as you know , mr. speaker , that came about from legislation . the five years were up , so that was one of our tasks to complete .
i feel that through the special committee , many community consultations , many back and forth and letters on the education act we did bring forth to the committee for them to look at .
that &apos;s quite an accomplishment .
as you know , there are a lot of things that still need a lot of work .
again i &apos;ve got to say that a lot of departments , when we lost the power plant in pangnirtung , our people got together , our ministers and our officials , to try to rectify the situation that was dire .
it &apos;s one of those things that we fear the most , where you lose a power plant in the middle of winter , but with good cooperation and assistance from the northwest territories , we managed to get things working again in pangnirtung without any accidents , injuries , or loss of life .
that &apos;s quite an accomplishment and that &apos;s one the things that i &apos;m quite proud of because it took a lot of departments to make sure that took place .
again , one of the things that we look at is the public service act that took eight years to complete . that &apos;s one of the things that have taken place .
mr. speaker , there are many more accomplishments that we have done with this government .
i know there &apos;s a lot more to be done yet and that &apos;s one of the things about governments . we could be here another hundred years and there are still going to be lots of things that we &apos;re going to accomplish .
mr. speaker , again , when we lost the school in cape dorset , it was a dire situation .
again , the ministers and officials took care of that without any loss of life . it was a dire situation .
it took a lot of work from all departments , finance , education , community and government services , and it took a lot of effort .
we had to coordinate people to make sure that things were taken care of , the needs of our people and the students .
again , the situation in kugaaruk where another school was lost , i understood that after one week the students from kindergarten up to grade 2 , i believe , were already back in school . that took a lot of effort and a lot of sleepless nights for officials and ministers to accomplish that .
mr. speaker , i &apos;ve got to commend the members that ensured that there was open communication between the government and the community . i appreciate the efforts put forward by the regular members from pangnirtung , cape dorset , and kugaaruk when these dire situations happen .
again i thank the members for the assistance that they provided .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
as the premier indicated , there is much to do yet for nunavummiut through this government .

thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
premier of nunavut , mr. peter taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t have a crystal ball and as usual , we do have a transition process within the government for this transition from after general elections . that &apos;s taking place at this point where we &apos;re making it easier for the transition into the new government .
i don &apos;t know where the new government may be and again , that &apos;s something that we have to honour .
as the outgoing government , we do make transition plans for the next government to take place .
that &apos;s one of the things we have started already at this point to make sure that once the general elections take place and there &apos;s a new government sworn in , the transition is as painless as possible . there are many files that are ongoing and there are many things that still got to be done behind the scenes .
again , with the help of all the departments , we will ensure that the transition is as smooth as possible .
i can &apos;t say for sure whether we &apos;re all going to be there , including myself . i don &apos;t know that .
that &apos;s why i indicated that i don &apos;t have a crystal ball , but plans are already being put in place to make the transition a lot easier going into the next government .

question 702 - 4 ( 3 ) : status of portable classrooms for kugaaruk ( qirngnuq )
mr. qirngnuq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of education .
first i would like to express my appreciation for all the support the community of kugaaruk has received from the government of nunavut , from communities all across nunavut and ( interpretation ) canadians .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , we now know that the students are getting their supplies . i thank my colleagues for approving just yesterday the $ 10 million for the government to move forward with its plans .
for the sake of the people listening out there and ( interpretation ) the residents of kugaaruk , ( interpretation ends ) can the minister provide an update on the specific plans for the purchase and installation of the modular classrooms in the community of kugaaruk ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of education , mr. paul quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank my colleague for asking for an update .
i &apos;m happy to say that we were able to carry on with that . right now the department of community and government services is in the process of working on the plan .
they are the department responsible for the assets .
currently they still have to determine and they will probably find out quickly who will be constructing the new school . they &apos;re working on the plans as we speak .
secondly the portable classrooms that will be used for the classes are under preparation . we want to bring them into the community by this fall .
currently they are focusing on six portable classrooms to be shipped to kugaaruk .
that is happening as i speak . obviously they are working on that development . i am also very happy that i am scheduled to travel to kugaaruk on march 20 .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. qirngnuq .
mr. qirngnuq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate that replacing the lost school is a huge task and the government has worked very hard in a short period of time to address the situation .
can the minister provide further information on how the modular portable classrooms will be shipped to the community of kugaaruk ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of education , mr. quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
the portable classrooms can only be shipped up via sealift , which is the case with most communities where bulky items are shipped . this will follow that same process . we expect that the classrooms will be put on a cargo ship scheduled to go to kugaaruk .

that is unfortunate .
this document that i will table shortly and which is the subject of my questions will be available to the minister for his information .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , subsection 24 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the inuit language protection act says that the minister of languages is required to &quot; develop policies or programs intended to promote increased learning , proficiency and linguistic vitality of the inuit language , including its revitalization through initiatives targeting communities or age groups in which there are special concerns about language loss or assimilation . &quot;
can the minister tell us what specific programs are currently being undertaken by the government of nunavut to protect and revitalize the inuit language ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of languages , hon. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
in my earlier response i indicated that many details are included in this review .
we are collaborating with the regional inuit associations as well as with nti .
the review will be completed in partnership . to reiterate , the subjects he is asking me about are included in this review .
i can only speak to it upon the completion of the review and it had been scheduled for the spring , but we are a bit behind schedule .
nonetheless , it is obvious that this review will be completed by the fall session and a report will be available for tabling in the house .
thank you very much , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. joanasie .
mr. joanasie ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
can the minister tell us today : what is the total amount of funding that the government of nunavut has allocated to programs designed to revitalize and protect the inuit language for the upcoming 2017 @-@ 18 fiscal year ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of languages , mr. kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
in regard to my colleague &apos;s question about the amount , i can &apos;t provide that detail at this time .
i have to consult with my departmental officials and once i have the amounts , i will be able to provide the funding amounts relative to his question .
thank you very much , mr. speaker .

question 704 - 4 ( 3 ) : support for more daycare spaces in baker lake ( mikkungwak )
mr. mikkungwak ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of education .
mr. speaker , in the past the minister of education has frequently stated that when his department builds a new school in a community , that school will also include space for a daycare .
sadly the plans for a new middle school in baker lake fell off the capital plan last year .
can the minister provide an update on what other options might be available to baker lake to establish another daycare in the community ?
thank you very much , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of education , mr. paul quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank my colleague for requesting that information. any community can establish a daycare .
with respect to private daycare initiatives , this has to be done by first identifying a facility as well as establishing their own ( interpretation ends ) society status . ( interpretation ) once the society is established , the department of education would be able to provide funding for their operations of the daycare .
our department is not responsible for acquiring facilities specific to daycares . the initiative has to come from the community .
with the establishment of the society , the funding becomes available for the operations of the daycare .
i can only encourage the residents of baker lake to identify a building for a future daycare space as well as the society status , as our department waits for applications for a future daycare , if they wish to operate it .
we just wait for applications .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
i recognize that the government &apos;s decision not to build a new middle school in baker lake is due to problems with attendance .
i can assure the minister that the community is working hard to address this issue .
the last school to be built in baker lake was the jonah amitnaaq school . it was supposed to have a daycare , but currently there isn &apos;t one .
can the minister explain why some new schools include daycares and others don &apos;t ?
thank you very much , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of education , mr. paul quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
yes , indeed my colleague is truthful in bringing up the fact that not all schools have daycare spaces while some of the newer schools such as the one in naujaat and newer schools include a daycare facility .
the need for daycare facilities was recognized and new school designs and / or school additions do include that , as this requirement was established after the construction of the jonah amitnaaq school was completed .
that is the situation today .
obviously , as per my many references to that fact , new school designs or school additions include the requirement for daycare space .
this is the current requirement , but many of our schools don &apos;t have daycare spaces as this requirement for such a facility was decided after the completion of those schools .
as an example , it occurred with the jonah amitnaaq school , which is the case today .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . your final supplementary , mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
as long as the capital plan does not include a new middle school for baker lake , then the option of including a new daycare in that new school will also be on hold .
will the minister commit to working with the community of baker lake through its dea and other local organizations to identify other opportunities to establish more daycare spaces and to provide the necessary support to get those spaces open for those who need them ?
our students who may have been able to attend school if there were more daycare spaces are currently unable to attend .
the need for more daycare spaces in our community of baker lake is extremely important as it would result in students being able to attend their classes as required .
thank you very much , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of education , mr. quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
the department of education works on these issues through the ( interpretation ends ) early childhood education ( interpretation ) division and we have a full complement of staff . our employees are able to work with local communities , such as baker lake .
perhaps the local dea can invite the officials to meet with them and the specialists in the ( interpretation ends ) early childhood division ( interpretation ) will be available from our offices . we have these positions in our offices .
further , i want my colleague to be aware that we &apos;re going to start reviewing the child day care act and ascertain what improvements are required to better manage daycares we operate . we will do a comprehensive review of the ( interpretation ends ) child care act ( interpretation ) and my expectations are that there will be improvements .
i want to reiterate what i said earlier about the local deas , such as in baker lake , that can submit their application for assistance or if they want further information on establishing new daycare facilities so that this initiative can move forward .
i just want my colleague to know that .

my questions today are for the minister of economic development and transportation .
mr. speaker , during saturday &apos;s sitting of the house the minister committed to getting back to me with detailed information concerning my questions about her department &apos;s positions in pond inlet .
i appreciate having received a letter earlier today which indicated that the position of transportation programs officer in pond inlet is currently filled on an indeterminate basis .
for the record , can the minister confirm the total number of positions that her department currently has filled in pond inlet ?

hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank the member .
yes , i do have the information for all of nunavut where our department has positions . there are approximately 136 positions in total , of which 97 positions are filled and 35 positions are vacant .
specific to pond inlet , our department has ... .
although this information isn &apos;t completely updated , there are perhaps eight positions in pond inlet out of nine in total .
there is one position for the ( interpretation ends ) senior finance and administrative officer ( interpretation ) that is not actually based in pond inlet , but it is currently open .
thank you , mr. speaker .

question 706 - 4 ( 3 ) : update on the activities schedule of mv nuliajuk ( rumbolt )
mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker . good afternoon , members . good afternoon to the people of sanikiluaq .
mr. speaker , my questions today are for the minister of environment .
as the minister will recall , i asked him a number of questions concerning the activities of the government &apos;s research vessel during our recent fall sitting .
in his response , the minister indicated that his department had recently lapsed its five @-@ year plan for the research vessel and that there would be a meeting early in 2017 to plan a schedule of activities for the vessel .
can the minister explain how the government determines the schedule of activities for its research vessel ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of environment , mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
the priorities of the research vessel are determined by the research meetings that occur there .
what projects that the proponents want to do are all put there , including the funding and where they &apos;re coming from .
the people who run the boat , the people for environment , and the people who are doing the studies meet there and they come up with a plan and prioritize which projects they will do a research on in the coming year .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. rumbolt .
mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also asked the minister last fall what activities the research vessel would undertake in the coming year .
in his response , he stated that there would be a meeting in january / february to determine the activities .
can the minister tell us what the government &apos;s research vessel will be used for during the upcoming 2017 @-@ 18 fiscal year ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of environment , mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
the vessel will be used for researching in nunavut .
mr. speaker , the list has not come back to me yet .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. rumbolt .
mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker .
hudson bay is a large inland sea that seems to be rich in underwater marine life .
can the minister indicate when we can expect to see the research vessel collecting data in the waters surrounding the belcher islands ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of environment , mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
unfortunately i can &apos;t tell the member when that will be . a lot of the research that is done is external funding .
it is done through external funding as the funding that we have to do the research in nunavut is limited . like i told you , i have not got the results back of what research they want to do within nunavut yet .
the hamlet or the hto in sanikiluaq can put a proposal in and say what they want studied .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s going to be done , but it would be looked at . they were doing some studies around chesterfield inlet and wager bay last year .
if there are resources to be studied around sanikiluaq and the funding is there , then i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be done .
the meetings dictate where they go and as of now i don &apos;t know where the research is going to be done .

question 707 - 4 ( 3 ) : recommendations of nunavut &apos;s coroner ( okalik )
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of health .
as we are aware , the work of the department is piling up , especially when there was a coroner &apos;s inquest into one of my constituents in january , and then there was the auditor general of canada &apos;s report on the hospital and its recommendations .
for the benefit of hospital patients , will your department ensure that it will respond to the recommendations in these reports before going on to other tasks ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of health , mr. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate the member speaking on behalf of the coroner &apos;s report of the incident that happened and i can ensure the member that the department of health is looking over the recommendations from the report itself .
that being said , there are also a number of recommendations from the office of the auditor general &apos;s report that have overlapped .
we will be able to track the progress of that through the action plan that will be forthcoming , that will be shared with committee members prior to the office of the auditor general &apos;s appearance in the public accounts committee .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. okalik .
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) i know the department is under barrage at times , but i feel that health care for nunavummiut is and lives matter .
i stress that the minister stay focused and report on the findings from the department on these two reports in particular .
when can the minister report on these matters in the future ?
( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of health , hon. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate the member &apos;s acknowledgement of the work that goes into when reports of this nature are brought to the attention of the department of health .
it may be a little bit off topic , but i am going to use it as a segue into informing this house that , because of all these reports that have come to the attention to the department of health ; the office of the auditor general &apos;s report , the recent coroner &apos;s report , in addition to the privacy commissioner &apos;s report upcoming ; i have instructed the department to delay the implementation of the advisory board of the qgh .
health care provision to nunavummiut is a priority and that is where we need to focus what limited resources we have on .
at this time , like i said , i have instructed the department to delay the implementation of that board .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. okalik .
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , i agree . i know that it is very important . we need to get over and deal with them .
i would like to ask the minister when his department is going to respond to the recommendations . when will we be expecting a response to the report ? thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . minister of health , mr. hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker . while i can &apos;t commit to a specific time , i can assure the member and all members that when reports of this nature or topics of this nature come to the department of health , especially when we are dealing with the quality of care , it is the priority of the department of health to make sure that we not only respond to recommendations , but that we implement action behind those recommendations to make sure that incidents like the member has brought up don &apos;t happen again , for one .
the department has taken a number of steps through our continuous quality improvement .
we &apos;ve got designated people tasked to make sure that the quality of care for nunavummiut is consistent across the territory and that the level of care that is being provided is what they expect and what they should expect .

oral questions . member for iqaluit @-@ niaqunnguu , ms. pat angnakak .
question 708 - 4 ( 3 ) : negotiating non @-@ insured health benefits ( angnakak )
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of health .
mr. speaker , during this recent sitting my colleagues and i have raised a number of issues with respect to funding for health services .
with respect to a number of issues , such as medical travel and accommodation , for example , the minister has often indicated that the costs related to providing their services are closely tied in with what is covered under the non @-@ insured health benefits program .
can the minister of health clearly describe the process that is followed when he and his staff attempt to negotiate for additional financial support from the federal non @-@ insured health benefits program ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of health , mr. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
the member &apos;s timing is impeccable . negotiations are ongoing , as i stand here , with health canada specifically on non @-@ insured health benefits funding and care that &apos;s provided through that agreement .
that being said , those discussions don &apos;t just happen when an agreement comes to its sunset . there are continual conversations that occur on establishing rates for boarding homes , medical travel , food allowances , and prescription care .
there are a number of different factors that play into the continuous dialogue that happens with health canada on the provision through non @-@ insured health benefits .
that being said , i am very much looking forward to see how negotiations continue to progress with this next phase of our agreement with health canada on nihb .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i recognize that medical travel and accommodation are only two of the benefits provided for under the non @-@ insured health benefits program . the nihb program also covers certain dental services , pharmaceuticals , and vision care .
can the minister clearly explain who decides what dental services , pharmaceuticals , and types of vision care are going to be covered under the nihb program and who decides how much the program will pay for each of those items or services ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of health , mr. hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
that &apos;s a very good question . when we negotiate a lot of our agreements in general with health canada , but specifically to nihb , they still have control over the rates of what we receive from the services that we act on their behalf .
an example , escort travel is not covered through nihb .
that turns out to be a government department of health expense .
when we &apos;re talking about prescription drugs of what makes the list , those are discussions that occur with health canada on what specific pharmaceuticals would be covered .
it &apos;s a collaborative effort , but at the same time it is a federal program that we administer on their behalf .
like i had mentioned , there are a number of discussions that happen ongoing , but at the end of the day it is a federal program that the government of nunavut administers on behalf of the federal government .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
the non @-@ insured health benefits program is coordinated under the federal government &apos;s first nations and inuit health branch , as the minister stated , and it appears that the benefits are identical for first nations and inuit clients .
however , it is well known that the costs for products and services are much higher in nunavut than in the south .
can the minister describe how the benefit amounts for products and services under nihb are reviewed and calculated ? how is it taken into account when we have higher costs here in nunavut ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of health , mr. hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
the member is preaching to the choir .
that is my exact argument and the argument that the department continuously puts forward to health canada to acknowledge the higher costs associated with providing health care in nunavut all across the board , not just under the first nations and inuit health branch , but in addition to all the services .
we do have agreements with other jurisdictions on reciprocal billing where rates are established and set for procedures to be accessed in other jurisdictions .
i can &apos;t speak to what benefits first nations get on specifics .
all i know is that the agreement that we have with health canada , like i had said , it &apos;s a continual adventure , i &apos;m going to call it , of educating our federal counterparts in acknowledging the level of care that we need to provide , considering the limitations that we have geographically and economically .
it is an argument that i make every opportunity i get to any of my counterparts across the country , not just the federal side of things .
we rely upon nwt , alberta , manitoba , and ontario to provide health care for our residents out of our different regions .
there &apos;s continual dialogue and there &apos;s a lot of support that i &apos;ve had verbally and in any correspondence i &apos;ve had with my other counterparts in other jurisdictions .
it is an ongoing effort to make sure that other people recognize the high level of costs .
the more statistics and more data that gets gathered , the more information that we &apos;re gathering through our own department help lend credence to our argument to move forward in sustainable , appropriate funding for health care .

question 709 - 4 ( 3 ) : need for more elders facilities in nunavut ( qirngnuq )
mr. qirngnuq : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the minister of culture and heritage .
mr. speaker , during our recent fall sitting my colleague , the member for gjoa haven , tabled the resolutions from the 2016 annual general meeting of the kitikmeot inuit association .
in these resolutions the kitikmeot elders delegation expressed their need for &quot; funding opportunities for infrastructure , operation and maintenance funding for elders &quot; buildings in the kitikmeot . &quot;
mr. speaker , these types of buildings include designated spaces for elders to meet with one another and other members of their communities to discuss important issues , such as cultural development and community crime prevention initiatives .
mr. speaker , according to its current 2016 @-@ 19 business plan the department of culture and heritage has allocated $ 405,000 to its elders support program which &quot; supports community @-@ based elder initiatives throughout nunavut . &quot;
can the minister clarify if his department &apos;s elders support program can provide funding for the development or maintenance of elders buildings in nunavut ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .

hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker . i also thank my colleague for his question .
mr. speaker , i understand his question on the communities having a meeting place for elders and youth .
the communities can put in proposals for that . if there was a building in the community to renovate it for the elders and youth to meet at and if there &apos;s a request for such a proposal , the department of culture and heritage can provide them funding for the renovation . if the community can identify a building that can be used , for instance , to his question , we have funding available for renovations for that building in the community .

mr. qirngnuq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
he didn &apos;t quite answer my question , so i &apos;ll ask him again .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , our elders need a designated space where they can meet with youth to discuss ways to reduce crime and violence in their communities .
can the minister clearly explain how his department &apos;s elders support program ensures that each community has this type of designated space ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of culture and heritage , hon. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk : thank you , mr. speaker .
as i said earlier , maybe the inuktitut , because of our dialects , maybe he didn &apos;t quite understand what i said .
mr. speaker , what i &apos;m saying is our department has funds available where any community that wish to renovate or fix up a building in the community that they wish to use towards our elders and our youth to use to do whatever activities they would like to do in the community .
i cannot say which communities that are not being used but could be fixed up to be used to have groups like my hon. friend is mentioning , elders and youth to use it for meetings and whatever .
i can tell the member that we have funds available for such buildings where they can renovate it and get it fixed so that they can use that building to have their meetings and whatever in the community .

question 710 - 4 ( 3 ) : dust control initiatives ( mikkungwak )
mr. mikkungwak : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the minister of community and government services .
earlier during this sitting my colleague , the member for rankin inlet north @-@ chesterfield inlet , asked the minister of economic development and transportation a number of questions concerning dust control in nunavut .
in her response , the minister stated that &quot; $ 2.5 million will be used for dust suppressants .
since it &apos;s going to be a feasibility study , we are going to be including different types of dust suppressants . &quot;
can the minister of community and government services clarify if his department will still be responsible for dust control initiatives in nunavut &apos;s communities and , if so , can he clarify how exactly his department will be sharing this role with the department of economic development and transportation ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
just to clarify first that i can &apos;t speak for the department of economic development &apos;s budget and their intended use of their budget , but i can speak to dust control in my department .
we fund the municipalities for dust control and we will still continue to do that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak : thank you , mr. speaker .
as the minister is aware , i have raised concerns regarding the need for more effective dust suppressants in baker lake on many occasions in this house .
in my community we are unable to apply calcium chloride on our airport road due to its proximity to the community &apos;s runway , resulting in large amounts of dust rising and moving through the community during summer months .
mr. speaker , this is a significant issue for residents in my community , as it negatively affects air quality and individuals with respiratory problems .
can the minister indicate if his department has conducted any research to determine what other types of dust suppressants could be used on baker lake &apos;s airport road and , if not , why not ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
the member is correct in terms of calcium chloride being a corrosive .
mr. speaker , last year we had a pilot project to test a different dust suppressant product called dustop .
there are certain conditions that have to be met for it to be fully functional .
at that time the results for iqaluit were inconclusive due to weather conditions .
in arviat they cancelled the test pilot altogether because it was raining and it was too cold in the fall .
this summer they will be testing it there and this product can be put on airport roads .
depending on the outcome of this product , we may or may not use it for other communities to come because it is four or five times more expensive than calcium chloride , but if it lasts longer and if it &apos;s cost @-@ effective , we will look into it .
we will look at any other products that might help the dust problem in nunavut because the member is concerned about dust in baker lake , but i have heard from almost all the mlas . it is a concern in all the communities and we would like to come up with a viable solution .
currently we use calcium chloride because , when laid down properly , it is effective and it &apos;s the most economical means that we have right now to try to suppress drugs in nunavut ... dust .
thank you , mr. speaker .
&gt; &gt; laughter
speaker ( interpretation ) : your final supplementary , mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak : mr. speaker , the ultimate solution to dust control in our communities would be to pave the roads , but i recognize that paving all of nunavut &apos;s roads is not feasible at this time .
however , there is an alternative method which involves applying a solution to gravel roads , which binds the gravel and dust together with a solution that forms a pavement @-@ like foundation . this method is often referred to as a &quot; poor man &apos;s pavement . &quot;
can the minister clarify if his department has looked into the feasibility of using this approach on nunavut &apos;s roads ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
we &apos;re always looking at other options and we have read up on other options . we have not tried any other options in nunavut . we have read up on a few ; we have not tried them .
we just take one product at a time . we will see how this dustop product works and if it works well , then that &apos;s what we might go with .
if it doesn &apos;t work out well , then we will look at the next step .
this dustop sounds good , but there has to be no rain , it has to be above 5 degrees , and traffic cannot go on it for 24 hours . it has limitations on where it can be , but we will check this product first , just one step at a time . if this product is not viable , then we will take the next step and try another product .
we fully want to take the dust problem head @-@ on , but we &apos;ve got to do it economically .

minister mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
members of the committee of the whole , i am pleased to be here today to speak to the proposed changes to the social assistance act .
the bill to amend the social assistance act is part of the department of family services &quot; ongoing efforts to review and reform income assistance .
the income assistance program provides assistance to vulnerable nunavummiut to meet their basic needs and supports individuals and families in moving towards independence and self @-@ reliance through a variety of programs .
( interpretation ends ) in sivumut abluqta our government committed to help nunavummiut reduce their dependence on government .
to accomplish this , we are committed to review and reform our income assistance program .
as you know , over the past year my department and the department of economic development and transportation travelled across nunavut to hear from nunavummiut about how our programs can better serve communities .
we heard clearly that we can improve the current system so that it does a better job helping nunavummiut meet their basic needs and encourages nunavummiut to work .
last june we tabled our final report on the review and reform of income assistance and economic development , which outlines a number of proposed reforms to accomplish this goal .
( interpretation ) one of these reforms under the category of strengthening internal administration is updating the social assistance act .
the social assistance act provides the legal authority for the income assistance program .
during our preliminary review of the program , we had identified that the act would benefit from a number of modest updates , such as replacing outdated terms , updating content related to privacy legislation , and shifting some elements to regulations . specifically the bill to amend the social assistance act includes the following proposed changes :
changing the name of the act from social assistance act to income assistance act .
&quot; income assistance &quot; is the umbrella term for all programs that provide support to vulnerable nunavummiut to meet their basic needs .
this includes social assistance but also , for example , the daycare user subsidy and the senior fuel subsidy .
changing the name of the social assistance act will improve the clarity of the legislation .
( interpretation ends ) updating and removing terms that are out of date . this includes , for example , references to &quot; welfare . &quot;
strengthening content related to privacy legislation . the bill adds new content to specify under what circumstances the department may collect and use personal information to align with requirements under the access to information and protection of privacy act .
this is especially important since the current social assistance act was created before the introduction of the access to information and protection of privacy act .
standardizing content related to the appeals process .
although the appeals process itself will not change , the bill proposes to move sections of the appeals process to regulations , which will allow the department flexibility to improve the appeals process on an ongoing basis by requiring a regulation change rather than a change to the act . the amendment also strengthens the independence of the appeal board by clarifying that department of family services &quot; staff cannot be members of the board .
together the proposed changes to the act are meant to improve the administration of income assistance programs , provide more clarity on the program , as well as strengthen the act &apos;s provisions for privacy and confidentiality .
i will also note that although the changes to the act are considered minor , the broader work on the income assistance review and reform is ongoing . as most of the income assistance rules are set out in regulation rather than in legislation , many of the reforms we are aiming to implement can be made without legislative changes .
( interpretation ) with the 20 proposed reforms we outlined in the final report on the review and reform of income assistance and economic development , nunavummiut will be able to engage with an income assistance system that is more focused on their strengths and goals .
those that need help will receive it , and there will be stronger supports to help nunavummiut build their skills , work in the wage economy , or through traditional livelihoods .
( interpretation ends ) we still have more work to do to turn these proposed reforms into real changes . ( interpretation ) i look forward to continuing to update members on progress on each of these reforms , and i thank you for your support in moving this important work ahead .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you , minister mike .
does the chair of the standing committee on legislation have opening comments ?
mr. sammurtok .
mr. tom sammurtok : thank you , mr. chairman .
as chair of the standing committee on legislation , i wish to make some opening comments as the committee of the whole begins its consideration of bill 26 , an act to amend the social assistance act .
the standing committee recognizes that bill 26 was introduced to amend the current legislation by updating terminology , improving the operations of the appeals process by moving it to regulations , and to address the collection , use , and disclosure of personal information .
amending the current legislation was one of the recommendations in the government &apos;s report on the review and reform of income assistance and economic development which was tabled in june of 2016 .
standing committee members appreciate that implementing the other recommendations of that report may also include additional changes to regulations and policy as well as a number of other initiatives . members encourage the minister and his staff to ensure that information with respect to revised or new regulations associated with the legislation is shared with members of the assembly at the earliest opportunity .
mr. chairman , while the standing committee accepts that a number of the proposed amendments to the current legislation will improve the income assistance appeals process , members expressed some concern with the length of time allocated for that process to be conducted .
clients who have been denied income assistance could wait up to 30 days to receive a resolution regarding their appeal of that decision .
members were of the view that this is a long time to wait without being able to buy food to feed a family and recommend that future revisions of the regulations address this issue .
mr. chairman , i would like to take this opportunity to thank nunavut &apos;s information and privacy commissioner for her input during the standing committee &apos;s review of bill 26 .
her comments and observations relating to the access , use , and disclosure of personal information collected under the auspices of the legislation reinforced the standing committee &apos;s position that the bill needed to be strengthened with respect to the protection of privacy of income assistance clients .
the standing committee was therefore in full support of an amendment to clause 13 of bill 26 to ensure that information collected under the act will only be used for clearly specified and prescribed purposes , that any information @-@ sharing agreements will put limits on the disclosure of personal information , and that retention and destruction schedules of information collected will be included .
another amendment to the bill under clause 12 clarifies the reference to taxation laws to specifically refer to the income tax act and the income tax act ( canada ) .
mr. chairman , the standing committee welcomed the opportunity to work with the minister to strengthen and improve bill 26 , an act to amend the social assistance act .
the standing committee recommends the passage of bill 26 , as amended and reprinted , to all members .
mr. chairman , that concludes my opening comments .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. sammurtok .
are there any general comments to the opening comments by minister mike and mr. sammurtok ?
if there are none , let &apos;s go to bill 26 in your legislation binder . we will begin the clause @-@ by @-@ clause review of bill 26 . please indicate if you have any questions as we &apos;re going through the bill .
i will proceed .
i have the english copy , so i &apos;ll read it in english .
it reads , ( interpretation ends ) bill 26 , an act to amend the social assistance act . ( interpretation ) clause 1 .

ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. chairman .
i would like to ask the minister a question related to collection and use of personal information .
i would like to know how you will go about ensuring that the clients using the service who must provide written consent absolutely understand what they &apos;re consenting to .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
i also thank the member for that question .
yes , this issue relates to the implementation of the social assistance act . when the legislation started being used , the matter of confidentiality arose and due to that issue surfacing , the issues surrounding confidentiality became clear .
that is included in the amendments to the legislation .
i want that clearly understood , especially by the listening audience .
with that being the case , amendments have been made to undertake these changes .
now a client served by the department is included in the compiling of the information and they are required to sign a form due to the confidentiality issues that arise from providing their personal information and to allow the social worker to release this information to other officials they have to work with . this is part of the process to protect confidentiality of a client served by a social worker , as they have to consent to the information that applies to them .
the information can be shared only with their consent .
this legislation is to protect confidentiality of the client and within the parameters of the protection of privacy legislation .
that would allow the client to be served and to abide with our existing legislation .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .

minister .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. chairman .
these proposed amendments to the technical standards and safety act ( tssa ) and the building code act ( bca ) are meant to ensure that these two &quot; companion &quot; pieces of legislation are consistent in how they deal with safety issues related to the design , construction , and operation of buildings , facilities , and equipment .
the major changes to these two pieces of legislation that are under these amendments include :
expand the role of the building advisory committee to include tssa matters . this means that designers , builders , and others who seek permits and approvals under both pieces of legislation will now have the same opportunity to seek redress related to regulatory officials &quot; decisions and to inform potential independent advice to the minister under the tssa than they will under the bca once both are proclaimed .
provide a distinction between regulatory functions of &quot; inspection &quot; and &quot; investigation . &quot;
amend municipal legislation to remove the authority to pass by @-@ laws adopting and modifying the building codes of canada .
amend the administrative penalties provision to make them an absolute liability standard ( tssa ) .
i want to thank you , mr. chairman , and colleagues for this opportunity to review the proposed changes in this bill .
i would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have .
thank you , mr. chairman .

does the chair of the standing committee on legislation have opening comments ?
mr. sammurtok .
mr. tom sammurtok ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman . ( interpretation ends ) as chair of the standing committee on legislation , i wish to make some opening comments as the committee of the whole begins its consideration of bill 28 , an act to amend certain acts respecting codes and standards .
as members will recall , bill 28 received second reading on october 25 , 2016 and was referred to the standing committee on legislation for consideration .
the standing committee supports the intent of bill 28 , an act to amend certain acts respecting codes and standards .
during the minister &apos;s recent appearance before the standing committee on the occasion of its clause @-@ by @-@ clause consideration of bill 28 , a total of fives motion were moved to amend the bill . for the benefit of nunavummiut who are following our proceedings today , i would like to take this opportunity to highlight the major amendments to bill 28 .
clause 7 of bill 28 has been amended to ensure that a building official &apos;s power to collect and disclose information during the course of their inspections or investigations of a building is only used to the extent that is necessary for the purposes of fulfilling their duties under the building code act , or otherwise authorized by a warrant .
similarly a new clause has been added to bill 28 to ensure that an inspector &apos;s power to collect and disclose information during the course of their inspections or investigations of equipment is only used to the extent that is necessary for the purposes of fulfilling their duties under the technical standards and safety act , or otherwise authorized by a warrant .
mr. chairman , the standing committee had raised the issue of the collection and disclosure of information under the current legislation .
the standing committee encourages the government to ensure that the collection and disclosure of information under the building code act and the technical standards and safety act is undertaken strictly for the purposes of implementing the legislation .
mr. chairman , that concludes my opening comments .
the standing committee recommends the passage of bill 28 to all members .

bill 30 - an act to amend the fire prevention act - consideration in committee
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
if you have any opening comments on bill 30 , minister savikataaq , i now give you the floor .
minister .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. chairman .
these amendments to the fire protection act are meant to address current inconsistencies with the fire prevention act compatibility with the new building code act .
the major changes to the legislation under these amendments include :
change the name from the fire prevention act to the fire safety act ,
expand the current fire prevention act to cover both fire prevention and fire protection ,
require municipalities to make and maintain a fire protection plan that would be consistent across the territory relative to standards of fire protection ,
make consequential amendments to the fire prevention act that recognize statutory provisions in the building code act , and
expand the role of the building advisory committee to include fire safety act matters .
i want to thank you , mr. chairman , and colleagues for this opportunity to outline the proposed change in this bill before the house .
i would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you , minister .
does the chair of the standing committee on legislation have opening comments ?
mr. sammurtok .
mr. tom sammurtok ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman . ( interpretation ends ) as chair of the standing committee on legislation , i am pleased to make opening comments as the committee of the whole begins its consideration of bill 30 , an act to amend the fire prevention act .
as members will recall , bill 30 received second reading on november 8 , 2016 and was referred to the standing committee on legislation for consideration .
the standing committee supports the intent of bill 30 , an act to amend the fire prevention act .
during the minister &apos;s recent appearance before the standing committee on the occasion of its clause @-@ by @-@ clause consideration of bill 30 , an act to amend the fire prevention act , a total of two motions were moved to amend the bill .
one of the amendments provides for a public right of access to copies of municipal fire protection plans on a similar basis to that which presently exists under the emergency measures act regarding public access to copies of municipal emergency management programs .
the other amendment clarifies a reference in bill 30 to a provision of the building code act .
bill 30 , an act to amend the fire prevention act , establishes a number of new responsibilities on the part of municipalities and the office of the fire marshal .
the standing committee looks forward to future annual reports of the fire marshal accounting in detail for progress made in fulfilling these responsibilities , including the development of municipal fire protection plans .
the standing committee also notes that subsection 23 ( 3 ) ( d ) of the building code act provides for a representative of the office of the fire marshal to sit on the nunavut building advisory committee .
the standing committee looks forward to the tabling of the first annual report on the activities of this entity .
the approach to the development of municipal fire protection plans that is provided for in bill 30 , an act to amend the fire prevention act , is similar to that which is provided for in section 6 of the emergency measures act with respect to the development of municipal emergency management programs
however , although the emergency measures act received assent on november 8 , 2007 , sections 5 to 9 of the statute still have not yet been brought into force , almost a decade after the statute was passed by the second legislative assembly .
from its dialogue with the minister , the standing committee has been advised that the government hopes to complete this process within 18 months .
the standing committee also has been advised that the government intends to bring those provisions of bill 30 that , and i quote , &quot; pertain to municipal fire protection plans &quot; into force &quot; no later than june of 2018 . &quot;
consequently municipalities would have six months in which to make and submit their fire protection plans by january of 2019 .
the standing committee appreciates the department &apos;s commitment to working closely with the nunavut association of municipalities and the nunavut association of municipal administrators regarding municipal compliance in this area .
section 1.1 of the current fire prevention act provides that the legislation binds the government of nunavut .
however , the extent to which the office of the fire marshal has the jurisdiction to conduct inspections and issue decisions and orders in relation to buildings and other physical structures under the control of the federal government within the territory of nunavut is unclear .
the standing committee recognizes the jurisdictional complexities in this area .
mr. chairman , that concludes my opening comments .
the standing committee recommends the passage of bill 30 , as amended and reprinted , to all members . ( interpretation ) thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
are there any general comments on the opening comments ?
if there are none , please refer to bill 30 in your legislation binder .

ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i just have one question under this about municipalities to maintain the fire protection plan .
i &apos;m wondering if the minister can tell us how aware are the municipalities about this amendment and how prepared are they , and perhaps if he can give us some more information on where communities stand today when it comes to a fire protection plan , if they have any at all .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. chairman .
the municipalities have been informed twice through nam meetings .
the fire prevention plan will be a template that is offered to the municipalities where they , in certain areas , fill in the blanks for the stuff that they have and then fine @-@ tune it to their own municipality .
we will be helping them out with that .

with respect to the assistant fire marshal that would be in the community , it says , &quot; review of orders by assistant fire marshal or local assistant . &quot;
who would be the local assistant ? there are many communities . can you explain this ?
thank you very much , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t quite understand the question . if he can rephrase it for me , please .

chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
mr. mikkungwak , can you rephrase the question ?
mr. mikkungwak : thank you , mr. chairman .
i &apos;m referring to the local assistant .
who would that be , seeing that we have 25 communities within the territory ?
can he identify who that local assistant would be and duties and powers , and how long they would attain those powers ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister savikataaq , do you understand ?
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. chairman .
i thank the member for clarifying .
this section would be rarely used , there being quite extraordinary circumstances . it &apos;s where the fire marshal can ask for assistance from someone while they &apos;re doing an investigation or other matters just in the short term , if there is no one there and it was just pertaining to whatever issue he is dealing with at the moment in that community .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak : thank you , mr. chairman .
who would this local assistant that you have identified in the document be ?

can he identify who that local assistant would be in the respective communities ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. chairman .
this person will be whoever the fire marshal identifies as a qualified person to help .
it could be the by @-@ law .
it could be the fire chief .
it could be one of the fire departments .
it would be anyone who the fire marshal deemed would fill the need to be his local assistant .

we will now be reviewing bill 38 .
minister ell @-@ kanayuk , if you have any opening comments , i now give you the floor .
minister .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
on february 21 , 2017 bill 38 , the nunavummi nangminiqaqtunik ikajuuti implementation act , received first reading , and i was pleased to review this bill with the standing committee on legislation on march 9 , 2017 .
( interpretation ends ) this bill provides the necessary support for the new nni policy by providing legal authority to specific provisions , a regulation @-@ making power to make the nni policy binding , as well as clarity on certain matters where there may be a conflict with other gn legislation .
this bill also recognizes and empowers the bodies created by the policy , namely , the tribunal and the review committee .
as my colleagues are aware , there have been concerns raised regarding the binding nature of nni tribunal recommendations under the new nni policy .
this legislation provides the nni tribunal with more authority , which will further ensure compliance by government contracting authorities .
this bill is necessary because we have determined that there are provisions in the nni policy that should be supported through legislation and not simply through policy or even through changes to regulations under the financial administration act .
in fulfilling our obligations under the nunavut land claims agreement , the new nni policy was developed collaboratively with nunavut tunngavik incorporated .
this collaborative process allows the parties to address overarching concerns about the nni policy and its intended benefits .
we have also consulted with nunavut tunngavik incorporated throughout this legislative project to ensure that our intent was fully understood .
this legislation demonstrates to nunavummiut and to the business community our government &apos;s strong commitment to implementing article 24 of the nunavut land claims agreement by ensuring proper and full implementation of the new nni policy .
it should be emphasized that the proposed nni implementation act does not introduce any provisions that are not currently in the new nni policy .
as members will recall , the new nni policy is set to come into force on april 1 , 2017 .
it is our hope that bill 38 can be passed before the coming into force of the new nni policy to ensure that the policy &apos;s provisions have the necessary legal authority .
i have invited officials from my department as well as the department of justice to assist me today .
i look forward to the committee &apos;s questions and comments regarding bill 38 , the nunavummi nangminiqaqtunik ikajuuti implementation act . ( interpretation ) thank you .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
does the chair of the legislation committee have opening comments ?
mr. sammurtok .
mr. tom sammurtok ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman . ( interpretation ends ) as chair of the standing committee on legislation , i am pleased to make some brief opening comments as the committee of the whole begins its consideration of bill 38 , the proposed nunavummi nangminiqaqtunik ikajuuti implementation act .
as members will recall , bill 38 received second reading on february 22 , 2017 and was referred to the standing committee on legislation for consideration .
the standing committee recognizes that the new nni policy was agreed to by both the government of nunavut and nunavut tunngavik incorporated and is scheduled to come into effect on april 1 , 2017 .
the standing committee further recognizes that bill 38 does not change any of the provisions in the new nni policy itself .
mr. chairman , that concludes my opening comments . the standing committee recommends the passage of bill 38 to all members . ( interpretation ) thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
are there any general comments on the opening comments ?
if there are none , please refer to bill 38 in your legislation binder .

i was wondering if the minister can tell us , when it comes to the tribunal and appointments to sit on the tribunal and in fact the review committee , whether or not the business representatives of nunavut will be taken into consideration to make sure that at least somebody from the business sector sits on either the tribunal or the review committee .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk : thank you , mr. chairman .
the nni tribunal will be comprised of five members and they will be an independent tribunal . we will be appointing two of the five members from the list of nominees that will be provided and three will be appointed by the government of nunavut .
the gn and nti will be free to select the individuals who have demonstrated background in business and have knowledge of economic realities in nunavut , training and / or experience in procurement law , procurement practices , and government contracting .
the answer to that question is yes , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. chairman .
how long would the term be for the five appointed members ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
members of the tribunal will have a term of three years .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. chairman .
are these members who are appointed for this three @-@ year term able to resubmit their application to continue their representation on the nni tribunal ?
thank you very much , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .

chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. chairman .
with regard to the appointments representing all of nunavut in this role of the nni tribunal , what happens when a party complains about the appointment ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : i apologize , mr. chairman .
i have no idea of the usage of the term &quot; complaint &quot; and f the person wants to be the chair and somebody complains .
perhaps i am off on a tangent here .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
mr. mikkungwak , please clarify your question .
mr. mikkungwak ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. chairman .
that was unfortunately misunderstood .
when any business submits an appeal for any contract they may have lost out on , does the businessperson have the ability to appeal that decision based on the appointee &apos;s background or the fact that they are not representing all of nunavut , as they have to review appeals for all of nunavut ?
as i understand , these tribunal members have to have awareness of the whole territory of nunavut , otherwise it would seem like a harried response based on a frivolous appeal , as this language seems to indicate that any business appealing a contract has that right . does this also apply to the various government contract rfp advertisements that are quite numerous , and will this apply to every single contract that this tribunal will oversee ?
thank you very much , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : yes , they will be representing all of nunavut .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. chairman .
i just want to ask if the minister can clarify once again in regard to appointments , how many appointments the gn makes and how many appointments the federal government makes and nti makes .
i wasn &apos;t quite clear . maybe you can just clarify exactly who is making the appointments and how many .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister ell @-@ kanayuk , can you clarify that again ?
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk : thank you , mr. chairman .
two will be appointed by nunavut tunngavik incorporated and three by the government of nunavut .

bill 41 - an act to amend certain acts respecting annual reports provided to the speaker - consideration in committee
chairman ( interpretation ) : we can now proceed .
we will now be working with the speaker of the legislative assembly .
i would first like to ask the speaker if he would like to have any witnesses .
mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : yes , i have witnesses that i would like to bring to the witness table .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
the speaker would like his officials at the witness table .
do you agree ?
some members : agreed .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you . sergeant @-@ at @-@ arms , please escort the witnesses in .
thank you .
mr. speaker , we will be dealing with bill 41 . if you have any opening comments , you now have the floor .
mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
i will be speaking in english , as my documents are in english .
( interpretation ends ) thank you , mr. chairman .
i am pleased to have the opportunity to appear today before the committee of the whole on the occasion of its consideration of bill 41 , an act to amend certain acts respecting annual reports provided to the speaker .
as members are aware , the legislative assembly recommends the appointment of five independent officers : the chief electoral officer , the information and privacy commissioner , the integrity commissioner , the languages commissioner , and the representative for children and youth .
all of these office @-@ holders report to the legislative assembly .
each office @-@ holder &apos;s enabling legislation requires that an annual report on his or her activities be submitted to the speaker of the legislative assembly for tabling in the house .
as members are very much aware , a number of these reports are the subject of televised hearings each year on the part of standing committees of the legislative assembly .
at present there is significant inconsistency with respect to statutory reporting deadlines for annual reports of independent officers .
for example , section 68 of the access to information and protection of privacy act requires the information and privacy commissioner to submit an annual report &quot; by july 1 in each year , &quot; which is only 90 days after the end of the previous fiscal year .
by contrast , section 24 of the official languages act requires the languages commissioner to submit an annual report &quot; within twelve months after the end of each fiscal year . &quot;
the purpose of bill 41 is to create uniform reporting deadlines for the annual reports of our independent officers , which will achieve significantly greater consistency and predictability .
all independent officers will be required to submit their annual reports to my office within six months after the end of each fiscal year .
this is a reasonable time frame in which to produce a comprehensive annual report and it is a time frame which will allow for the annual reports to all be tabled in the house during its fall sitting .
i would also note that the management and services board has aimed to help facilitate the timely preparation and submission of such annual reports by providing assurances to all independent officers that the board emphasizes the importance of the information contained in such annual reports , and does not expect them to incur significant expenditures of time and resources with respect to extraneous physical production features .
bill 41 contains additional provisions regarding the chief electoral officer &apos;s separate reports on the conduct of elections , by @-@ elections , and plebiscites .
at present section 23 of the inuit language protection act requires that the annual reports of the inuit uqausinginnik taiguusiliuqtiit ( inuit language authority ) be submitted to both the minister of languages and the speaker of the legislative assembly prior to being tabled in the legislative assembly .
given that the members of the inuit uqausinginnik taiguusiliuqtiit are appointed on the recommendation of the minister , it is more appropriate for the minister to be solely accountable for receiving and tabling these annual reports .
bill 41 amends this section of the statute to provide for a clear line of accountability .
i would also note that bill 41 does not affect the ability of independent officers to submit special reports on matters of concern to the legislative assembly at other times .
for example , as members will recall , the information and privacy commissioner recently produced a special report on her office &apos;s privacy audit of the qikiqtani general hospital , which i tabled in the house on november 8 , 2016 .
mr. chairman , that concludes my opening comments .
i look forward to responding to any comments or questions that my colleagues may have . ( interpretation ) thank you .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
are there any general comments ?
if there are none , are there any questions to the opening comments ?
if there is none , please refer to bill 41 in your legislation binder .
we will be reviewing it clause by clause .
i believe you all have a copy in front of you .
i have an english copy , so i &apos;ll read it in english . ( interpretation ends ) bill 41 , an act to amend certain acts respecting annual reports provided to the speaker . ( interpretation ) clause 1 . do you agree ?

mr. speaker , if you have any closing remarks , i now give you the opportunity to make them .
mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : i thank you all . i would also like to thank all the staff at the legislative assembly . i thank all of my colleagues .
bill 43 - an act to amend the legislative assembly and executive council act - consideration in committee
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you .
mr. speaker , we would like to deal with bill 43 . if you have any opening comments on bill 43 , i now give you the opportunity to make them .
mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . my apologies .
thank you , mr. chairman .
&gt; &gt; laughter
i was just following your lead .
( interpretation ) i am pleased to have the opportunity to provide some brief opening comments concerning bill 43 , an act to amend the legislative assembly and executive council act .
bill 43 amends schedule c of the legislative assembly and executive council act to change the indemnities and allowances payable to members .
these changes reflect the recent signing of a new collective agreement between the government of nunavut and the nunavut employees union .
the base rate of pay for members of the legislative assembly will be increased by the same percentage as that which has been agreed to for members of the nunavut employees union .
mr. chairman , that concludes my opening comments . i look forward to responding to any comments or questions that my colleagues may have . ( interpretation ) thank you .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . are there any general comments or questions on the opening comments ?
if there are none , please refer to the bill 43 in your legislation binder . i believe you all have a copy of the bill .

( interpretation ends ) thank you , members .
i wish to advise the house that i have received written notice under rule 20 ( 2 ) that the member for cambridge bay intends to raise a matter of personal privilege under this rule .
i now recognize the member for cambridge bay . mr. peterson , please proceed .
point of privilege
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today pursuant to rule 20 ( 1 ) on a personal matter where i would like to correct published accusations against myself .
mr. speaker , as elected officials and especially as cabinet ministers , we are scrutinized by the public and media quite a bit .
over time we learn to develop a pretty thick skin and just roll with the punches that are thrown at us as we go about our duties serving the people of nunavut .
however , there comes a time when enough is enough .
mr. speaker , the media publishes a lot of stories that single out the work i do as a cabinet minister in this government . for the most part i live with facts that are published .
saying that , i feel i must address a recent story reported by kent driscoll which i saw on aptn &apos;s national news website on march 9 entitled , and i quote , &quot; former nunavut premier asking why a report on rcmp being kept secret . &quot;
there are three statements that i believe are incorrect in the interview that misquote myself and could effectively and recklessly misinform the public .
in the video mr. driscoll states , and i quote , &quot; the government of nunavut commissioned a report into civilian oversight of the rcmp . &quot;
mr. speaker , neither myself nor the government of nunavut have commissioned a report into civilian oversight of the rcmp .
i believe i clearly stated in both the october 18 , 2016 and march 2017 hansard that i have asked my justice officials to review what other jurisdictions do across canada as it relates to oversight of police forces .
in the written summary of the story on aptn &apos;s website , mr. driscoll writes , and i quote , &quot; the report investigated civilian oversight of the rcmp across canada , and how that could work in nunavut . &quot;
again , there is no report and we did not investigate civilian oversight of the rcmp across canada .
mr. driscoll singles out the rcmp .
my request to my staff was to review what other jurisdictions in canada are doing for policing oversight .
again , i believe that is clearly stated in the hansard .
a misconception might have occurred when i responded to questions on march 2 saying , and i quote , &quot; it &apos;s not a report i &apos;m going to make public , but it &apos;s an internal report ... &quot;
mr. speaker , in the context of the discussion i was referring to , i asked my staff to gather information for me on what other jurisdictions in canada do in relation to police oversight .
that is all , mr. speaker , gather information by calling other provincial and territorial jurisdictions and do some basic internet research .
furthermore , mr. driscoll states , and i quote , &quot; okalik requested the review of civilian oversight of the rcmp in 2016 , after a high profile incident in iqaluit &apos;s cells . &quot;
mr. speaker , i reviewed the hansard from when mr. okalik questioned me on october 18 , 2016 and nowhere do i see where mr. okalik requested a review of civilian oversight of the rcmp . he does ask me if i , and i quote , &quot; support the establishment of a civilian oversight body here in nunavut , yes or no ? &quot;
it is pretty clear in our exchange that i did ask my justice officials to look at what other jurisdictions in canada were doing in relation to police oversight .
moreover mr. okalik was referring to civilian oversight relating to comments from an ottawa police service member on social media and not specifically to incidents in rcmp cells , as the story indicates .
it concerns me that the reporter tried to make it seem that i have commissioned a report into the civilian oversight of the rcmp . this is clearly not true if you research and review hansard .
i would like the rcmp to be rest assured that the government of nunavut values the dedicated and often dangerous work that the members of the rcmp do to protect our citizens and our communities across our great territory .
mr. speaker , the discussion of civilian oversight and the investigation of serious incidents involving the rcmp and nunavut is a complicated one which began last spring .
it still requires a great deal of work .
indeed , in the shared directional statement i signed with the rcmp which was tabled in the legislature in november of 2016 , we made a shared commitment to address this issue , stating that , and i quote , &quot; the gn and rcmp agree that allegations of police misconduct must be taken seriously and acted upon . &quot;
mr. speaker , i would like to close by stating that i have the utmost respect for the men and women of the rcmp who protect our communities .
they are part of our communities , their children attend school with our children , they participate in special events , and give of their time volunteering in our communities . for that i am very thankful .
i hope this clears up the misconception that this story has created .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker : thank you .
as rule 20 requires no action from the chair or the house , the matter is closed and we will proceed to the next item on the orders of the day .

good afternoon , my colleagues , nunavummiut , and kuglukturmiut .
mr. speaker , i rise today to talk about the women who have been sewing a tapestry in kugluktuk in recognition of the missing and murdered indigenous women .
our representative on that commission travelled to take part in this inquiry .
they are trying to determine what happened to their loved ones who have disappeared or who have been murdered .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , in my hometown of kugluktuk local volunteers , including the former commissioner , edna elias , had the idea of making a tapestry . edna reached out to the community of kugluktuk with the idea and the response from our community was immediate and strong . sixteen people joined together to begin the work on a tapestry .
mr. speaker , the tapestry honours the women who have been murdered or are missing from kugluktuk . the people who worked on the tapestry kept the missing and murdered individuals in their minds as they diligently completed the project .
the tapestry was given to the rcmp officer who was posted in kugluktuk and now is working for the missing and murdered indigenous women inquiry in ottawa . the tapestry makers believe that the officers will have this as a reminder of the people and their families who are looking for answers as the inquiry begins .
mr. speaker , join me as we thank the people of kugluktuk who worked on the tapestry and remember all nunavummiut and their families that have been affected by this .

i was very happy to take part and seeing big , huge lake trout and pike . one of the pictures is in my binder where you will be able to see the size of the fish .
i &apos;m sure you have seen pictures in the media of families who were very happy to go out on the land and go out as a family to these fishing derbies . when things go well during a fishing derby , we are very glad .
next year we are looking forward to other fishing derbies and in upcoming years .

item 6 : oral questions
question 711 - 4 ( 3 ) : chesterfield inlet airport ( sammurtok , t )
mr. tom sammurtok ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the minister of economic development and transportation .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , last year the minister tabled her department &apos;s nunavut airports 20 @-@ year infrastructure needs assessment .
this report indicates that chesterfield inlet &apos;s airport , and i quote , &quot; requires immediate replacement with a new building &quot; as a consequence of its &quot; failing structural and building system condition . &quot;
during our recent winter sitting i asked the minister to indicate where chesterfield inlet stands on her department &apos;s capital priority ranking list for airport terminal building replacements .
can she provide an update today on where this project currently stands ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank the member .
it &apos;s explained in the 20 @-@ year capital plan .
the 20 @-@ year capital plan is not for capital items . ( interpretation ends ) the 20 @-@ year capital plan is a planning process for the economic development and transportation agenda and it &apos;s not projects that are in or we are working to try to put them in a capital plan .
at this time chesterfield inlet is recognized that it is a priority for the department and that it needs replacement , but at this time there is no further movement .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. sammurtok .
mr. tom sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the minister for her response .
she just gave me some more questions to ask in a few days .
as the minister will be aware , the auditor general of canada recently issued a report on the topic of civil aviation infrastructure in the north .
this report indicates , and i quote , &quot; satellite @-@ based navigation has improved the efficiency of air transportation .
these navigation systems allow more direct flight paths , and they allow pilots with aircraft appropriately equipped for satellite @-@ based navigation to land aircraft under conditions with lower cloud bases . &quot;
however , it is my understanding that chesterfield inlet &apos;s airport currently lacks a modern gps approach , which has a negative impact on the ability of aircraft to land at the airport during certain weather conditions .
can the minister indicate if her department has raised this issue with the appropriate federal authorities ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the member for that question .
mr. speaker , our department works closely with federal authorities and this is one topic where we have been communicating , especially with the nunavut airports division , with the instrumental procedures that the member is talking about .
we have identified several runways in nunavut that need improvements in the navigational / instrumental aids .
we are currently working on some and currently addressing others to be worked on .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. sammurtok .
mr. tom sammurtok ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) as the minister will recall , the recent federal budget announced , and i quote , &quot; investments will also be made to resolve critical transportation needs in canada &apos;s north ... &quot; mr. speaker , that is indeed good news .
can the minister indicate if she has been advised by her federal counterpart as to what specific investments will be made to our transportation infrastructure ?
( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of economic development and transportation , ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk : thank you , mr. speaker . i thank the member for that question .
as we know , the budget was just recently announced . the terms and conditions of those funding arrangements are currently being discussed , so i &apos;m not able to say exactly which funding we will have access to , but i believe there are some in there that we will gladly be taking advantage of .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
oral questions .
member for iqaluit @-@ niaqunnguu , ms. pat angnakak .
question 712 - 4 ( 3 ) : carbon tax ( angnakak )
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
my question was going to be for the premier , but i have just found out that there has been a change of the minister for this portfolio .
my question is for the minister of finance , who i understand now has taken over this file , and it concerns the issue of the federal government &apos;s plan for a national carbon tax to be in place for every province and territory by the end of next year .
earlier this month a question was asked in the senate of canada on this issue . the government &apos;s representative in the senate responded by stating , and i quote , &quot; the pan @-@ canadian framework on clean growth and climate specifically recognizes the unique challenges faced by northern and remote communities with respect to pricing carbon pollution , compared to the rest of canada , including high costs of living and of energy , food security , and emerging economies . ( ... ) as part of this effort , a study to assess the implications of carbon pricing for the territories is expected to be launched this spring and completed in the fall . &quot;
mr. speaker , summer is just around the corner .
can the minister indicate the extent to which the government of nunavut will be participating in this study ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of finance , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank ms. angnakak for the question .
i would expect the government of nunavut to be a full and serious partner in the discussion .
the three territories have been recognized as special circumstances up here . it &apos;s exactly for the reasons you mentioned and it was mentioned in the senate .
i don &apos;t have the details of when we &apos;re going to get involved in the study , but i think the study is supposed to be complete by the end of august and we will go from there . i expect we will be full partners in the discussion in how we can move forward on carbon pricing .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;m hoping , with the new minister , that you will be up to date on the file for my next question .
during our recent winter sitting of the legislative assembly , the premier &apos;s letter to agnico eagle mines was tabled in the house . in his letter the premier wrote that the government of nunavut is , and i quote , &quot; working on developing a carbon tax that will make sense for nunavut . &quot;
can the minister describe what kind of carbon tax would &quot; make sense &quot; for the territory ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of finance , mr. peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
it &apos;s a good question .
again , because of our unique circumstances up here , we &apos;re almost 100 percent dependent on fossil fuels . we don &apos;t have hydro projects and we don &apos;t have much of any alternative energy up here , so we &apos;re 100 dependent on fossil fuels .
when we get into the meetings with our sister territories and the federal government , i &apos;m sure we &apos;re going to have some real , in @-@ depth , hard discussions on how carbon pricing could affect nunavut and ways to mitigate the potential additional costs on our territory , economy , communities , and government .
i &apos;m guessing now , but up to 80 percent of the communities rely on government funding one way or the other through fuel subsidy costs .
it &apos;s going to have a huge impact on our government .
of course i know the mining industry is very important to our territory , so we will have to take their concerns and other business as well into consideration and ensure that the government of canada understands our circumstances .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you for your response , minister .
that leads me to my last question .
the government of canada recently released its technical paper on the federal carbon pricing backstop .
in his response to this release , the premier of the nwt noted that the paper did not specifically address the north .
can the minister clarify the extent to which the three northern territories are working together to develop a joint position on the issue of carbon pricing ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of finance , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
i can &apos;t clarify to the extent . i know the premier and his colleagues have had extensive discussions over the last year or year and a half on carbon pricing at their various meetings in detail .
it &apos;s one of these situations where an issue of significance to the three territories requires us all to work together .
i don &apos;t anticipate that we will go individually to the government . we will be working together and probably establish a common message and arguments to approach the government of canada .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
oral questions .
member for gjoa haven , mr. tony akoak .
question 713 - 4 ( 3 ) : emergency measures act ( akoak )
mr. akoak : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the minister of community and government services .
as the minister is aware , sections 5 to 9 of the emergency measures act , which was passed in 2007 , are still not in force .
once in force , sections 5 to 8 of the act will require that all departments , public agencies , and municipal corporations to prepare emergency management plans .
during our recent winter sitting , members were informed that almost all municipal corporations had completed their emergency management plans .
mr. speaker , can the minister tell us if all government departments and public agencies have completed emergency management plans ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
the member is right that almost all communities are done now .
there are three communities that do not have it yet , that is , pangnirtung , pond inlet , and kugaaruk .
the training for the two communities in baffin has been done and the training for kugaaruk is planned for either the summer or fall of 2017 .
once these are done , all of the communities will have their emergency management plans completed and approved .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. akoak .
mr. akoak : thank you , mr. speaker .
once in force , section 9 of the emergency measures act will mandate that municipal and departmental emergency management plans &quot; shall be made available to the public for inspection during ordinary business hours at an office of the government institution or municipal corporation . &quot;
can the minister tell us if those emergency management plans that have already been completed are currently being made available for the public to access ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of community and government services , mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
my understanding is yes , the ones that are done would be available for the public to view at their hamlet office .
the emergency management plans are a community document . it &apos;s a plan on how the community would act in an emergency and what resources they have to deal with the emergency and where they can get more help if they need be .
if any members would like to look at the emergency management plan in their community that is done , my understanding is they can just go to the municipal office and ask to view it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. akoak .
mr. akoak : thank you , mr. speaker .
can the minister tell us if the government plans to bring sections 5 to 9 of the emergency measures act into force before the dissolution of this legislative assembly in september ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
as i stated earlier , the last training session for the last community will be in either late summer or the fall of 2017 .
we will do our best to make sure that &apos;s completed , but i can &apos;t make any commitments as to whether it will be done or not because we have to arrange for a mutual time for the training to be done for the last community . if it &apos;s done in a timely manner and it gets done , then it will be done .
if we have unforeseen circumstances to keep us from getting the training done , then it would have to be delayed , but it will come into force and we plan to have this done as soon as we can .

question 714 - 4 ( 3 ) : baker lake airport ( mikkungwak )
mr. mikkungwak : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the minister of economic development and transportation .
last year the minister tabled her department &apos;s nunavut airports 20 @-@ year infrastructure needs assessment .
this report indicates that baker lake &apos;s airport is one of four airports in the territory that require , and i quote , &quot; substantial upgrades to their existing atb facilities to address building system faults or major structural items . &quot;
on march 24 , 2017 the government issued a construction tender for renovations to baker lake &apos;s airport terminal building .
the tender closed on april 19 , 2017 .

this project is proceeding well .
as the member is aware , we &apos;re expecting that the work will proceed in the summer of 2018 with the regulatory bodies . as he indicated , it was discussed openly in pond inlet in february 2017 .
before their plan could be given to the nunavut impact review board , they had to do consultations .
we expect , as indicated before , it &apos;s proceeding as planned .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t think my question was answered .
if i wasn &apos;t clear enough , i apologize .

let me ask this question . once the design is complete , when will the project be submitted to the nunavut impact review board ?

mr. joanasie ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions today are also for the minister of economic development and transportation .
mr. speaker , during our recent winter sitting the minister informed me that her department is continuing to look at the need to relocate kimmirut &apos;s airport . as the minister will be aware , this issue was noted in the auditor general of canada &apos;s recent report on civil aviation infrastructure in the north .
mr. speaker , the recent federal budget indicated that , and i quote , &quot; investments will also be made to resolve critical transportation needs in canada &apos;s north ... &quot; i would like to ask the minister if she can indicate if her department will be submitting kimmirut &apos;s airport relocation as a priority project under this new federal investment plan .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk : thank you , mr. speaker . i thank the member for that question .
mr. speaker , i would also like to thank the auditor general for his report . it will help us in terms our work for funding from the federal government .
also to answer the member &apos;s question , the department will ensure that the relocation of the kimmirut airport project receives full consideration under the government of nunavut &apos;s capital plan .
sometimes when we &apos;re dealing with federal funds , before we can submit an application for funding , those funds have to be in the capital plan of our own government . having said that , we will be looking into the details of the current budget to look at and determine how to proceed with applications .
i would like to update the member that consultants have been hired to prepare phase 2 of the kimmirut airport relocation so that they can do a concept design and cost estimates . that work will be starting in june 2017 .
thank you , mr. speaker .

will you be able to table the results of the study in the house during our fall sitting ?

question 717 - 4 ( 3 ) : funding transfer decisions ( sammurtok , a )
mr. alexander sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of economic development and transportation .
mr. speaker , in march i received notification from the minister that funds had been transferred from the kivalliq visitor centre project to the grays bay road and port project .
can the minister provide an update on why the grays bay project was prioritized to receive extra funding and what other capital projects may receive funding out of the anticipated surplus from the kivalliq visitor centre project ?

hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk : thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;m glad that the minister is pleased and she might be able to transfer some of that funding to my next question .
&gt; &gt; laughter
mr. speaker , as my colleagues will be well aware , i have lobbied at length for the establishment of an elders &quot; care facility in rankin inlet , either by leasing a facility such as nanuq lodge or renovating another facility .
can the minister confirm whether any consideration was given to transfer surplus funds from the kivalliq visitor centre project to a project that will support the establishment of an elders centre in rankin inlet ?

the funding that we request from the federal government are arrangements and there are documents that we have to go by . if there is a surplus of that nature , the funding has to go within the same parameters that we asked for .

mr. sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
it is very disappointing that our government will not adjust its capital plan to address needs which have been identified in the kivalliq region as well as in the kitikmeot and baffin regions .
will the minister commit to working with her cabinet colleagues to ensure that surplus funding from her department &apos;s capital projects can be made available for such projects as a rankin inlet elders facility ?

mr. keyootak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the minister of economic development and transportation .
i would first like to thank the minister for her recent visit to qikiqtarjuaq .
this was an excellent opportunity for her to meet with local leaders and to see first @-@ hand the need for new marine infrastructure in the community .
as the minister will recall , i have raised the issue of marine infrastructure on a number of occasions .
can the minister indicate whether or not her department is working with the municipality to update the proposal for a new marine facility ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank my colleagues for keeping me on the hot seat .
( interpretation ends ) i made a trip to qikiqtarjuaq last week where i saw first @-@ hand the community plans for the project to support fisheries , tourism , and other growth industries in his community .
mr. speaker , i could gladly say that i have asked my officials to open discussions with other departments that will need to be involved in this and i look forward to their input .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker , again , i have directed my staff and we are going to have a close working relationship with the hamlet on the marine infrastructure project .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. keyootak .
mr. keyootak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
as the minister is aware from her recent visit to qikiqtarjuaq , a new marine facility would greatly help the community &apos;s fishing industry .
the recent federal budget indicated that , and i quote , &quot; to help connect northern communities to trade and investment opportunities , investments will also be made to resolve critical transportation needs in canada &apos;s north ... &quot; can the minister indicate whether or not marine infrastructure is eligible for funding under this federal initiative ?
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of economic development and transportation , ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank the member .
looking at the requests from qikiqtarjuaq and he federal government &apos;s recent announcement that there &apos;s funding available , we have to review all of the details . the federal departments are currently doing a review on the application process .
even if that &apos;s the case , we are going to start working with the community . i would also like to indicate to the member that the department of economic development and transportation might not be the lead department .
it might be either the department of environment or another department because it &apos;s mainly for the fishing industry .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. keyootak .
mr. keyootak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank the minister .
she already responded to part of my next question , but i would like to ask if the minister can indicate what the next steps are with respect to the qikiqtarjuaq marine facility .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank the member for that question .
near the end of last week we were in qikiqtarjuaq and we had a first @-@ hand look at the plans for the marine infrastructure .
i can tell him that i had brought over a large conceptual design to qikiqtarjuaq and i will make sure that it &apos;s put up in a visible area in my office this week so that my colleagues can see it .
my officials have indicated that they are going to work with other departments within the nunavut government and they &apos;re going to discuss and review the plan , including the request that was made by qikiqtarjuaq .
we have indicated our willingness to help and i have also requested some documents which will be provided to the mayor and the hamlet council to show how our visit to the community was productive .

oral questions .
member for iqaluit @-@ niaqunnguu , ms. pat angnakak .
question 719 - 4 ( 3 ) : nni policy ( angnakak )
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i didn &apos;t want to be the only one not asking the minister of economic development and transportation a question , so this question is directed to her .
as the minister is aware , the government &apos;s new nni policy came into effect on april 1 , 2017 . section 9 of the new policy provides for the establishment of an nni tribunal , which replaces the contracting appeals board under the old nni policy .
the tribunal is to be composed of five members .
can the minister confirm who has been appointed to serve on the nni tribunal ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the member for that question .
at first i thought , because all the members have been asking me questions , i &apos;ll take it as notice , but i think i can answer this one .
thank you , mr. speaker .
appointees to the new nni tribunal under the nni implementation act , recent appointments were done and they are barbara tartak , al lahure , and sarah maniapik currently and another appointee who has canadian international trade tribunal experience is james ogilvie .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the minister for her response .
section 12 of the new nni policy provides for the establishment of an nni policy review committee , which is supposed to meet on a quarterly basis .
can the minister confirm who has been appointed to serve on the nni policy review committee ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the member for that question .
the nni review committee is not an appointed committee .
it &apos;s a committee formed under the nni implementation act and it &apos;s following the previous nni policy , which also had the review committee .
the people that serve on the review committee are the staff from the nni secretariat and also nti , who deals with their inuit firm registry .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the minister for her response .
section 17 of the new nni policy provides for bid adjustments in the government &apos;s procurement process .
the new nni policy now provides for additional bid adjustments for inuit firms with higher ownership levels .
to illustrate , the new nni policy provides that a firm with 100 percent inuit ownership level will receive an additional 5 percent bid adjustment above what firms with lower inuit ownership levels are entitled to receive . that was very interesting .
it is the responsibility of nti to determine the relative levels of inuit ownership of firms on its registry .
can the minister confirm if nti has provided the government with an updated listing of firms , including their inuit ownership ratings ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the member for that question .
mr. speaker , the inuit firm registry is a registry that is dealt with by the inuit organization designated to register inuit firms and currently that is nunavut tunngavik incorporated .
they do the listing for the inuit firm registry . i have not heard of currently whether they have provided us a list , but i do know the list is readily available on the website .
thank you , mr. speaker .

oral questions . member for south baffin , mr. david joanasie .
question 720 - 4 ( 3 ) : community justice initiatives ( joanasie )
mr. joanasie : thank you , mr. speaker .
i have questions for the minister of justice .
mr. speaker , community justice outreach workers are responsible for ensuring that nunavummiut are able to access remedies provided under the family abuse intervention act , such as emergency protection orders and community intervention orders , within their communities .
during our recent winter sitting , members were informed that the department of justice was working to transfer a number of community justice outreach worker positions from municipal governments to newly created positions within the government of nunavut .
can the minister indicate how many community justice outreach worker positions have been transferred from the municipal governments to the government of nunavut as of today ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of justice , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
it &apos;s my sincere pleasure to give minister monica ell @-@ kanayuk a break from question period here .
i hope i can answer as well as she has .
mr. speaker , the plan was to transfer five positions this year .
two have been completed , one is in the process , and two are also in the process , but we &apos;re looking for office space .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. joanasie .
mr. joanasie : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the minister for his response .
can the minister tell us what specific benefits these transfers will have for the individuals who fill these positions and the communities that they serve ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of justice , mr. peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
it &apos;s anticipated that they will have a closer working relationship with our department and we will be able to provide more direction and support to them ; reporting relationships , training , and other benefits of that sort .
in some communities it &apos;s difficult for cjows to focus on their work . under the contribution agreement , they may be asked to do other work for the hamlet . in this case they would just focus on the work that the department of justice requires them to do .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. joanasie .
mr. joanasie : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank again the minister for his response .
can the minister clarify if these community justice outreach workers are also responsible for providing administrative support to community justice committees and , if not , can he clarify who is ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of justice , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
of course the government of nunavut appreciates all the hard volunteer work that community justice committees provide in providing a continuum of justice from the community level and up .
i know a lot of the volunteers commit many hours of their free time to the service in their communities . through the department of justice , through the cjows , we do provide support for the community justice committees .
it may vary between communities depending on who the individual is , but we do provide a level of support to the justice committees .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
oral questions .
member for rankin inlet , mr. alexander sammurtok .
question 721 - 4 ( 3 ) : results of beer and wine store plebiscite in rankin inlet ( sammurtok , a )
mr. alexander sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is to the minister of finance .
earlier this month plebiscites were held in the communities of rankin inlet and cambridge bay on the question of whether or not beer and wine stores should be opened in the communities .
in rankin inlet approximately 38 percent of eligible voters went to the polls ; 372 votes were cast for the &quot; yes &quot; side of the question and 127 votes were cast for the &quot; no &quot; side of the question .
can the minister provide a clear timetable for when the government will make a decision concerning whether or not to open a beer and wine store in rankin inlet ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of finance , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
it was indeed a very good turnout for the community of rankin inlet and also for the community of cambridge bay .
voters in those communities spoke very loudly with their vote what they wanted , in this case a beer and wine store .
as i said , it was a non @-@ binding plebiscite , so the government is not bound to move forward or anything on establishing a beer and wine store soon in either community .
it is likely that we will do some further consultations . we will have to look at putting regulations in the liquor act . we will also probably have to do additional consultations in the community to talk about how the beer and wine store would operate .
i don &apos;t anticipate that it will be something that this government will be able to accomplish .
based on my knowledge and experience here in iqaluit with the iqaluit beer and wine store , that vote was on april 20 of 2015 and if the current plans are maintained , we won &apos;t be opening a beer and wine store in iqaluit until hopefully mid to late july of this year . that is over two years .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. alexander sammurtok .
mr. sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
what specific factors will the government consider in making the decision as to whether or not to open a beer and wine store in rankin inlet ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of finance , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
well , one of the main factors in the community of rankin inlet or any community for sure would be the availability of a facility .
we do have a facility in rankin inlet , the rankin inlet liquor warehouse .
if you would , let &apos;s say , go to cambridge bay , there is no facility and there is no liquor warehouse .
definitely a facility would be required and that would be a main priority .
in iqaluit we have the liquor warehouse here . we are making renovations to the liquor warehouse so that we can sell beer and wine there . that would be the main consideration .
again , we &apos;re going to do some more consultations with people in the community , special interest groups , and the hamlet council and talk about hours of operation , days of operation , and other things that they may raise with us , just to make sure everybody understands what the beer and wine store would accomplish and how it will operate .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. alexander sammurtok .
mr. sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
when i arrived in iqaluit for the current sitting , it appeared that construction work is being undertaken to convert the government &apos;s liquor warehouse in this community into a retail outlet .
as the minister is aware , there is a similar warehouse facility in rankin inlet . is rankin inlet &apos;s liquor warehouse physically suited to being expanded or converted into a retail facility ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker : the hon. minister of finance , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
in iqaluit we did take the liquor warehouse , and then we &apos;re building an addition and we &apos;re calling it the beer and wine store .
it &apos;s part of it , but we &apos;re not selling liquor out of the beer and wine store . we &apos;re selling beer and wine .
i have been on a couple of tours of the warehouse in rankin inlet and it &apos;s a very nice facility .
i &apos;m not an architect or engineer . this is my amateur assessment . i would say that it offers potential to be renovated to some degree to sell beer and wine , but again , i &apos;m not an expert .
we have to fund these beer and wine store facilities through our nunavut liquor commission revolving fund , so we will also be constrained by the amount of financing we have available . we don &apos;t want to go to the government of nunavut seeking appropriation for doing renovations . we would try to do everything through our revolving fund .
obviously if there &apos;s an existing facility , then that in itself could help us open a beer and wine store without too much cost other than the cost of renovations .

minister of education
number : 023 - 4 ( 3 )
date : 14 march , 2017
subject : promotion decisions under section 15 of the education act
question 1 :
broken down by community and school , how many students in grades 9 @-@ 12 were promoted within the meaning of section 15 of the education act during each of the following school years :
2014 @-@ 2015
2013 @-@ 2014
2012 @-@ 2013
response :
please note that the response to question 1 has been incorporated in the response to question 2 .
question 2 :
broken down by community and school , how many students in grades 9 @-@ 12 were denied promotion within the meaning of section 15 of the education act during each of the following school years :
2014 @-@ 2015
2013 @-@ 2014
2012 @-@ 2013
response :
grade 9
it is important to note that from kindergarten through grade 9 , a student is either promoted from one grade to the next or retained in their current grade .
however , for reasons explained below related to the high school credit system and the unique path each student takes in moving through those grades , grade 9 is the last grade where promotion from one grade to the next , or retention in the current grade , happens in an absolute sense .
the following table presents the relevant statistics , at a territorial level , for the promotion and retention of students at the end of grade 9 for the requested school years .
these figures have not been broken down by school as the department is unable to release such data as per section 23 of the access to information and protection of privacy act , as with such small numbers it is possible that individual students could be identified .

grades 10 @-@ 12
entry to grade 10 allows for a variety of academic options to cater to a student &apos;s educational and career needs .
according to current practice , when a student first registers in a senior secondary school program , the student will be designated as a grade 10 student .
each personal learning path is unique .
students are placed in courses to fit their needs , at various grade levels depending on the student .
as they collect credits from successful courses they would move through the high school grades taking - depending on how they may be paced on entry to grade 10 - for example , academic , general or knowledge and employment ( kae ) classes .
students who have completed a minimum of 35 credits are designated as grade 11 when they register in any new courses , and students who have completed a minimum of 70 credits will be designated as grade 12 when they register in any new courses .
for example , potentially , students may be considered grade 11 due to their credit designation but they can be enrolled in grade 10 courses .
this is a normal and common occurrence .
in short , retention in a particular grade does not play a role in the high school setting in the same manner that it does from kindergarten through grade 9 .
for these reasons , it is not possible to collect or present accurate figures that would show the promotion data within the meaning of section 15 of the education act for the required years for students taking classes between grades 10 to 12 .
due to the high school credit process , relevant figures for this time in a student &apos;s development would include attendance and graduation rates .
question 3 :
broken down by community and school , how many students in grades 9 @-@ 12 were denied promotion within the meaning of section 15 of the education act on the grounds of academic achievement during each of the following school years :
2014 @-@ 2015
2013 @-@ 2014
2012 @-@ 2013
response :
the numbers of students retained from advancing beyond grade 9 , per region and per the requested years are included in the response to question 2 .
no further distinctions are made beyond what is included above .
as explained above , students earning credits from grades 10 to 12 move through the upper secondary years based on a credit system .
programs fitting their needs should have been found through the career and program planning process .
students in some cases can cross multiple grades based upon their credit count and academic path .
( for additional information regarding section 15 of the education act , please see attached appendix )
background
section 15 of the education act states that :
15 .
the school team , in accordance with the directions of the minister , is responsible for determining the promotion of students .
the school team
the school team would meet to determine the promotion of a student and would deny promotion in very rare cases and at the insistence of the parent or guardian .
when considering the retention of a student , the school team has to take into account the principles described in inuglugijaittuq : foundation for inclusive education in nunavut schools .
in deciding to not promote a student , the school team must give careful consideration to these principles :
performance in nunavut classrooms must be understood within the context of bilingualism .
educators must continually ask if a child &apos;s difficulty learning is the result of learning in a second language or other factors .
all practices and tools used to support student learning must take into consideration the first and second language context and abilities of students .
the language context influences both the content and the process of instruction ; educators must use differentiated instruction to meet varied student learning styles and language abilities .

asked by : paul okalik , mla for iqaluit @-@ sinaa
asked of : hon. keith peterson , minister of finance number : wq 24 @-@ 4 ( 3 ) date : march 14 , 2017
subject : administration of human resources manual ( hrm ) directive
206 : preferential treatment
question 1 :
broken down by department , territorial corporation and crown agency , how many approvals were granted within the meaning of section # 6 of hrm directive 206 : preferential treatment during the
2014 @-@ 2015 , 2015 @-@ 2016 , 2016 @-@ 2017 ( to date ) fiscal years ?
response :
responsibility for implementing section # 6 lies with the deputy head within each department or agency , in consultation with the deputy minister of finance .
this information is not tracked at the gn @-@ level .
at the departmental level , any documentation relating to hrm 206 becomes part of each individual employee &apos;s personnel folder .
departments do not compile this information centrally and cannot readily provide consolidated data .
question 2 :
broken down by department , territorial corporation and crown agency , how many approvals were granted within the meaning of section # 7 of the hrm directive 206 : preferential treatment during the 2014 @-@ 2015 , 2015 @-@ 2016 , 2016 @-@ 2017 ( to date ) fiscal years ?
response :
responsibility for implementing section # 7 lies with the deputy head within each department or agency , in consultation with the deputy minister of finance .
this information is not tracked at the gn @-@ level .
at the departmental level , any documentation relating to hrm 206 becomes part of each individual employee &apos;s personnel folder .
departments do not compile this information and cannot readily provide consolidated data .
question 3 :
broken down by department , territorial corporation and crown agency , how many approvals were granted within the meaning of section # 8 of the human resources manual directive 206 : preferential treatment during the 2014 @-@ 2015 , 2015 @-@ 2016 , 2016 @-@ 2017 ( to date ) fiscal years ?
response :
responsibility for implementing section # 8 lies with the deputy head within each department or agency .
any documentation relating to hrm 206 becomes part of the individual employee &apos;s personnel folder .
departments do not compile this information and cannot readily provide consolidated data .
please note that although the specific number of disclosures under hrm 206 is not centrally tracked , the department of finance employs a number of mechanisms to enforce the government &apos;s rules and policies against preferential treatment .
code of values and ethics
the responsibility for declaring a conflict of interest , including the potential for preferential treatment , lies with each public servant as outlined in the nunavut public service code of values and ethics .
employees are required to review the code upon being hired , and periodic information bulletins are sent to all employees reminding them of their obligations .
employees found to be in contravention of any part of the code are subject to progressive discipline , up to and including dismissal .
internal accommodations
internal mechanisms exist within the gn to accommodate employees after a declaration of a conflict of interest is received .
these accommodations are established on a case by case basis dependant on the working relationship and closeness of said individuals .
this can include replacing the conflicted person on a hiring panel , reassigning an employee to a different supervisor , or making similar accommodations .
all hiring panels include an independent staffing consultant from the department of finance , in order to ensure fairness and consistency and to avoid the possibility of preferential treatment .
reporting mechanisms
when a gn employee has concerns of impropriety or wrongdoing within the gn , including violations of hrm 206 , there are mechanisms for reporting these concerns .
part 6 of the public service act ( psa ) creates a process for employees to disclose wrongdoing to their supervisors and an independent ethics officer without fear of reprisal .
an employee reports the suspected wrongdoing to their supervisor , and in the absence of action , escalates the report th rough to their deputy head .
if the deputy head fails to act , then the employee can report wrongdoing to any other deputy head , including the deputy minister responsible for the public service act .
deputy heads have a duty to act on these reports .
employees can also consult with the ethics officer prior to making a disclosure under the act .
if the employee is not satisfied that authorities within the public service have taken reasonable steps to investigate and correct the wrongdoing , they may disclose the wrongdoing to the independent ethics officer for his investigation .

for the 2015 @-@ 2016 fiscal year , 17 applications were approved and went on to receive funding under the strategic investments program .
for the 2016 @-@ 2017 fiscal year 28 applications were approved and funded .
the exact number of applications that were received and rejected was not consistently tracked .
this is because each of the four offices involved in administration of the program has historically recorded such applications differently and has not consistently differentiated between applications that are rejected based on ineligibility , withdrawn , denied based on lack of merit or incomplete applications .
the department is developing clear internal procedures to allow this information to be tracked consistently in the future .
the application requirements for the strategic investment program are outlined in the policy :
for schedule a : nunavut business investment , applicants must submit a completed and signed application form .
that includes the following :
financing package that includes :
arms @-@ length debt financing or equity investment in the required proportions ; and
a client contribution , which can take the form of cash , sweat equity or existing assets .
business plan demonstrating potential for viability , sustainability and growth ;
three @-@ year historical financial statements ( if available ) ;
evidence that the initiative will provide net economic benefit beyond the financial return to the applicants ;
evidence that the initiative will create new jobs for nunavummiut ;
evidence of a capable and experienced management team ; evidence that the requested nbif contribution will complete the required funding package and result in the project being fully funded ; and
evidence that costs associated with the initiative are reasonable and that a sound procurement process will be followed for major project components .
for schedule b : nunavut economic foundations , applicants must submit a completed and signed application form that includes the following :
the project &apos;s potential for viability , sustainability and growth ;
how the project supports the department &apos;s strategic priorities or the economic development priorities of the community in which the project will take place ;
demonstration that the project will provide net economic benefit ;
demonstration of a capable and experienced management team ;
evidence that the project &apos;s costs are reasonable and that the project will use sound , competitive procurement methods for the purchase of all goods and services which make up a significant portion of project costs ; and
for the purchase of existing operations or assets , an independent professional valuation appropriate to the operation or asset being purchased and any other information requested by the department to assess possible conflicts of interest .
the reporting requirements for the strategic investment program are outlined in the contribution agreements and contain requirements specific to each project .
the policy requires that the reporting requirements include certain basic elements :
recipients are required to submit a report on the activities carried out , and the outcomes and benefits achieved by the supported project ; the report must address how these compare to the expected outcomes and benefits of the initiative .
recipients of contributions exceeding $ 100,000 are required to submit audited financial statements , at the discretion of the department , along with an audited schedule of revenue and expenses pertaining to the conditional contribution agreement .
in addition , interim financial information must be submitted to the department within 60 days of the end of the government of nunavut fiscal year in which the contribution was made .
question 1 ( h ) :
as of march 31 , 2017 , how much has the government spent on settlements for employees who declined to accept offers of employment for decentralized positions , and who subsequently departed the public service ?
clarifications for question 1 ( h ) :
this includes all individuals who selected option ( c ) within 90 days of receipt of their letter on the decentralization initiative and who had departed the public service as of march 31 , 2017 .
it would not include individuals who formally declined to accept offers of employment but
deferred their actual departure dates and had not departed the public service as of march 31 , 2017 .
this amount also includes removal costs .
and question 1 ( i ) :
as of march 31 , 2017 , what has been the total cost to the government of nunavut for the decentralization initiative , including , but not limited to , the following areas of expenditure :
i . relocation and removal costs for employees ;
ii . settlements and other compensation for employees declining offers of employment for decentralized positions ;
iii . advertising and recruitment ;
iv . infrastructure , office renovations and other capital expenditures , including all costs associated with the construction , provision and furnishing of staff housing in decentralized communities ; and
v. administrative and miscellaneous costs , including expenditures incurred by the decentralization secretariat of the eia ?
response to questions 1 ( h ) and 1 ( i ) :
the decentralization secretariat was dissolved and removed from eia &apos;s organizational structure per cabinet approval at the end of the first legislative assembly .
therefore , the costs presented in the response to the return to written question no. 10 @-@ 2 ( 4 ) in 2008 were the final values .

item 2 : ministers &quot; statements
minister &apos;s statement 296 - 4 ( 3 ) : canada post unveils nunavut stamp for canada at 150 ( taptuna )
hon. peter taptuna ( interpretation ) : good afternoon , my colleagues , nunavummiut , and kuglukturmiut .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , yesterday canada post unveiled a stamp as part of canada &apos;s 150th anniversary and celebrations .
the stamp features leah ejangiaq kines from arctic bay . it &apos;s a photo of her taken by her husband , clare kines .
as part of a series , the nunavut stamp honours 10 national moments in canada &apos;s history .
mr. speaker , the stamp celebrates a special moment in canadian history : the creation of nunavut .
for inuit it was a life @-@ changing moment and one that inuit had championed for many years prior to signing the nunavut land claims agreement on april 1 , 1999 .
while canada celebrates its 150th anniversary this year , nunavut only celebrates its 18th year as a territory , yet inuit history in our land spans thousands of years .
having the right to self @-@ government is deeply important to nunavummiut and i am proud that we have come this far together .
i would like to thank the speaker , the commissioner of nunavut , canada post , guests , and members of the assembly for joining us yesterday for the special unveiling that celebrates nunavut &apos;s creation .
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister of education , mr. paul quassa .
minister &apos;s statement 297 - 4 ( 3 ) : sound fields in education for nunavut youth ( quassa )
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
inclusive education promotes a model of education where all students have access to the education program with their peers .
mr. speaker , many of our students suffer from hearing loss . this has an impact on their ability to learn . it also affects their social and emotional development .
the prevalence of hearing loss in nunavut children is estimated to be up to 40 percent higher than in other parts of canada .
there are limited opportunities for formal screening of preschool or school @-@ aged children , so hearing loss can go undiagnosed until later in the child &apos;s life .
my department is taking action to support students with both known and undiagnosed hearing loss through the sound fields for learning project .
mr. speaker , since 2015 ten schools have had sound field systems installed in learning spaces to amplify the teacher &apos;s voice to ensure students hear clearly .
the installations were launched along with hands @-@ on training for staff , students , and parents around hearing loss and its connection to learning .
this initial phase was accomplished through a partnership with better hearing in education for northern youth and qikiqtani school operations .
my department will continue with the project and has ordered 200 new systems to be installed in the remaining schools across the territory .
this project supports students by addressing hearing loss as a barrier to learning .
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister of finance , mr. keith peterson .
minister &apos;s statement 298 - 4 ( 3 ) : let &apos;s be aware / ujjiqsuqta launched ( peterson )
hon. keith peterson : mr. speaker , i rise today to talk about let &apos;s be aware / ujjiqsuqta , a responsible use of alcohol campaign that i publicly launched in cambridge bay on march 22 and that is now being rolled out across nunavut .
let &apos;s be aware / ujjiqsuqta was developed to promote healthy and informed choices as a way to prevent alcohol @-@ related harm throughout the territory .
the campaign will help nunavut move toward the vision nunavummiut have described : healthier and happier communities and safer communities where the negative effects of alcohol are significantly reduced .
the goal of the campaign is to empower local communities through education and awareness . materials , resources , and activities in all languages are being created for the general public , alcohol education committees , individuals working in helping professions , as well as youth and young adults .
mr. speaker , nunavummiut can also find useful information , facts , tips , and resources on the let &apos;s be aware / ujjiqsuqta website at www.responsiblenunavut.ca or www.ujjiqsuqta.ca .

minister &apos;s statement 299 - 4 ( 3 ) : fans enhancements ( mike )
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
before i start , the residents of my community are in my thoughts as they will be attending a funeral this afternoon .
mr. speaker , i am pleased to announce that effective april 1 , 2017 changes have been made to the financial assistance for nunavut student ( fans ) program to allow more individuals to access student financial assistance for post @-@ secondary education and reduce the amount of personal financial burden that students incur .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , the department of family services has increased the amount of reimbursement for adult learners in successfully completed distance education courses from $ 250 per course , plus $ 200 for books , plus fees and postage , to $ 1,000 per course , including books , fees , and software with a lifetime limit of $ 10,000 of reimbursed expenses .
increasing support to distance education studies will allow more adults to access learning opportunities while also attending to their work and home commitments .
( interpretation ) the second change is an increase to the number of cities eligible for travel benefits under the fans basic grant . ( interpretation ends ) the department recognizes that a growing number of nunavut post @-@ secondary students are attending institutions outside of ottawa , montreal , edmonton , and winnipeg . ( interpretation ) the number of cities has now been expanded to 31 across canada , which will reduce or eliminate the additional travel costs students previously needed to pay themselves .
mr. speaker , these enhancements are a direct result of our commitment and dedication to providing the best assistance for our students , and to ensure that a lack of finances does not pose a barrier to post @-@ secondary education .
thank you , mr. speaker .

hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i am pleased to inform members that again this year the department of environment will be organizing community cleanups across the territory .
for over a decade now this annual event has become a key component of the department &apos;s pollution prevention program .
in addition to cleaning up litter that accumulates over the winter , the cleanups have proven successful in fostering community pride .
all communities across nunavut are participating this year and they will be holding community cleanups some time before the end of july .
mr. speaker , the nunavut community cleanups are a joint effort between the department of environment and hamlets throughout the territory .
nunavut tourism and corporate sponsors also play an important role in these events .
students in schools throughout nunavut were invited to participate in a contest designing a t @-@ shirt and a poster for the event .
i would like to congratulate all students who participated in the 2016 @-@ 17 contest .
the winners are jenova aggark , a grade 6 student at qitiqliq middle school in arviat designed the winning t @-@ shirt , and isabel tugak , a grade 1 student at rachel arngnammaktiq elementary school in baker lake designed the winning poster .
congratulations to jenova and rachel !

... rankin inlet and chesterfield inlet .
although my residence is in rankin inlet , my family has deep roots in chesterfield inlet .
mr. speaker , as a regional centre , rankin inlet is always on the government &apos;s radar screen . however , chesterfield inlet , as a smaller , non @-@ decentralized community , often seems to fall off the radar screen and i consistently hear the message from the community that it feels ignored .
mr. speaker , i am perfectly aware that a one- or two @-@ day visit to a community does not solve everything .
however , it is important for the government &apos;s top leaders to see with their own eyes the conditions of our smaller communities and to meet face to face with the community &apos;s local leaders .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker , i very much look forward to a positive response to my invitation , and ( interpretation ends ) i look forward to welcoming my friends opposite to chesterfield inlet this summer . ( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .

item 6 : oral questions
question 722 - 4 ( 3 ) : staff housing ( angnakak )
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
good afternoon to everybody .
mr. speaker , my questions are for the minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation and they concern the nunavut housing corporation &apos;s blueprint for action on housing .
action no. 22 in the blueprint indicates that the nunavut housing corporation will work with the department of finance to , and i quote , &quot; analyze the current staff housing rents and subsidies to determine appropriate subsidy levels that encourage staff housing tenants to transition out of government @-@ subsidized housing and into private rental or homeownership . &quot;
when i asked the minister about the status of this work back in march , he told the house that he had not been given an update on this issue .
i guess today my question is : is the minister in a position today to tell us what the government is doing ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation , mr. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
good afternoon , my colleagues .
i also thank my colleague for that very good question .
mr. speaker , i clearly remember the member &apos;s question . to date in regard to staff housing , i stated that it was going to be reviewed and they &apos;re still reviewing or analyzing the current staff housing .
i can &apos;t respond to the member &apos;s question because they &apos;re still working on it .
thank you very much , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
perhaps the minister can do a minister &apos;s statement in the next few days as to when he expects that to be done .
mr. speaker , an ongoing issue of concern , especially in smaller communities , is the lack of suitable staff housing for teachers and nurses .
this shortage impacts the ability of the government to recruit these essential positions .
action no. 41 in the nunavut housing corporation &apos;s blueprint for action on housing indicates that the nunavut housing corporation will , and i quote , &quot; conduct an impact analysis of various approaches to social and staff housing delivery ... &quot; including , and i quote , &quot; a lease @-@ only model for certain communities whereby the nhc leases staff housing units from private developers . &quot;
the blueprint for action on housing indicates that the nunavut housing corporation will undertake pilot projects in this area .
can the minister tell us today when and where these pilot projects will take place ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation , mr. kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
i again thank the member .
mr. speaker , as i stated earlier in my response , we &apos;re still working on it . action no. 41 that the member is referring to is still part of the review and they &apos;re still analyzing it for the communities . i can &apos;t respond to that question because it &apos;s part of the review on action no. 41 .
with regard to the blueprint for action , it &apos;s still being analyzed .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
again i would like to ask if the minister perhaps can provide us with an update in the house as to when all this will be done and completed .
mr. speaker , action no. 21 in the nunavut housing corporation &apos;s blueprint for action on housing indicates that the nunavut housing corporation and the department of finance will , and i quote , &quot; review and revise the gn &apos;s staff housing policy . &quot;
can the minister tell us today if a new staff housing policy will be finalized before the end of the current legislative assembly ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation , mr. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
we expect this to be completed during the term of this government , but we don &apos;t expect it to be finalized during this session . i &apos;ll be more prepared to speak to it during the fall session .

question 724 - 4 ( 3 ) : rankin inlet &apos;s freshwater supply ( sammurtok , t )
mr. tom sammurtok ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) my question is for the minister of community and government services .
mr. speaker , there have been a number of reports in the media this past month that have raised concerns and questions regarding nunavut &apos;s freshwater supply .
as the minister will recall , in the fall of 2016 i asked him a number of questions regarding rankin inlet &apos;s freshwater supply , nipissar lake , which is rapidly depleting .
in his response the minister stated that his department was &quot; working on getting a water board licence to pump water from first landing lake &quot; and that the department anticipated that it would be able to secure that licence &quot; by early summer of 2017 . &quot;
can the minister provide the house today with an update on his department &apos;s work to secure that water licence ?
( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , i remember being asked that question .
we are still working on the permitting process . the application is currently with nirb .
we believe that all the permitting needed will be done before summer . once we have the proper permits in place , we will start pumping water to replenish their water supply .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ends ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. tom sammurtok .
mr. tom sammurtok ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) can the minister tell us what contingency plans , if any , are currently in place in the event that the community &apos;s freshwater supply is depleted or made suddenly inaccessible ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
the current rate of natural refilling to nipissar lake is less than the amount being consumed .
even if we were not to replenish it , there is enough water there for quite a few years .
we &apos;re fully confident that we will resolve the problem . we do have permission to run from char river , but char river only runs when first landing lake is high in water since it flows from there .
we &apos;re dealing with the situation and i can assure the residents of rankin inlet that they will not run out of water .

speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t think that we have an overall plan to study all the needs of nunavut in one big , broad study .
we are always looking at water consumption from each community and the resources they have , whether it be a man @-@ made reservoir or a natural reservoir such as a lake , and we monitor them .
there are some communities that are having a current water shortage right now and we deal with them . it &apos;s a case @-@ by @-@ case basis .
we do have funding under the clean water and wastewater fund and we use some of that to build new reservoirs or expand . we are just dealing with each community on their own merit .

question 725 - 4 ( 3 ) : grays bay port and road project ( akoak )
mr. akoak : thank you , mr. speaker . good afternoon , colleagues , nunavummiut , and the community of gjoa haven .
my questions are for the minister of economic development and transportation .
the minister &apos;s response to my recent written question concerning her department &apos;s strategic investments program was tabled yesterday in the legislative assembly .
information contained in the response indicates that her department provided $ 550,000 to the kitikmeot inuit association during the 2016 @-@ 17 fiscal year to support the development of the grays bay road and port project .
for the record , i applaud the government for this important investment .
mr. speaker , for the benefit of our viewing audience and also to my colleagues on this side of the house , can the minister describe how this project is benefitting the kitikmeot ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank the member for that question .
i believe he &apos;s asking about grays bay , but it is still being proposed and there could be a lot of items . i believe your question is how this project is benefitting nunavummiut .
it is fully supported by the kivalliq inuit association .
there are a lot of proposals to do for mining projects in those regions .
it would also benefit people who would like to take additional training or who are proposing to learn a trade in order to work in that project .
for example , there could be heavy equipment operator training and training for other job opportunities that might arise through this project . it could be a big benefit to both regions .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. tony akoak .
mr. akoak : thank you , mr. speaker .
good to hear .
i think you mentioned the kivalliq instead of the kitikmeot .
mr. speaker , can the minister indicate what support her department is providing towards the grays bay road and port project during the current 2017 @-@ 18 fiscal year ?

i don &apos;t have the information in front of me , but i do know that to date we haven &apos;t set aside a large amount of money because we are currently negotiating and working together on this proposed project .
we are currently negotiating how we can move this project forward .

question 726 - 4 ( 3 ) : cannabis legalization ( mikkungwak )
mr. mikkungwak : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the minister of justice .
as the minister will be aware , his federal counterpart recently introduced bill c @-@ 45 in the house of commons .
this federal bill proposes to legalize cannabis across the country .
mr. speaker , our minister publicly stated in the legislative assembly last november that the government of nunavut has formed an interdepartmental working group to address the issue of marijuana legalization in nunavut .
can the minister indicate what specific actions this working group has undertaken to date ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of justice , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
the actions of the government of canada have certainly put a lot of pressure on provinces and territories to come up with some legislation to be ready for july 1 , 2018 . i think that &apos;s the date i have heard .
as the minister of justice and attorney general for nunavut and my colleagues across canada , we have expressed our concern to the minister of justice of canada and the minister of public safety that it &apos;s going to be very challenging for most jurisdictions to meet those deadlines and then have processes in place to distribute . it &apos;s very complex anyway and probably more complex in nunavut given our geography and our distribution network in nunavut .
those are the kinds of issues that our interdepartmental working groups have been working on .
now that we &apos;re near the end of may and we &apos;re in an election year , it complicates things .
we have to have legislation of some form in place in time for the federal legislation when it goes into force . now we &apos;ve got the pressure of territorial elections .
we will be reviewing the recommendations on how to go forward and of course anything we decide will have to go through this cabinet .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak : thank you , mr. speaker .
bill c @-@ 45 is currently being considered by parliament and has not yet become law .
will the government of nunavut be making a formal submission on this bill and , if so , will the government of nunavut be supporting or opposing the legalization of marijuana ?

minister of justice , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t believe this government is going to be , like most provinces and territories . i can &apos;t speak for them all , but we have expressed our concerns with the legislation and the pressures it &apos;s putting on us .
we are going to move forward and try to meet their timelines , but it &apos;s going to be a challenge .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak : thank you , mr. speaker .
some communities in nunavut have chosen through local option votes to prohibit the possession or sale of alcohol while other communities have chosen to restrict the possession of this substance through the establishment of alcohol education committees .
for the benefit of nunavummiut who are following our proceedings today , can the minister of justice clarify whether or not nunavut communities will be able to restrict the possession and sale of marijuana in the same way that alcohol is regulated and restricted ?

mr. mikkungwak certainly knows how to throw curveballs . maybe he should pitch for the toronto blue jays .
&gt; &gt; laughter
he &apos;s got a few knuckleballs , sliders , curveballs , and drop balls .
as i said in my earlier answer , it &apos;s going to be quite complicated . in nunavut we only have the distribution network for alcohol , beer and wine in two warehouses .
we have to figure all that out , the logistics and distribution . that &apos;s why we have the interdepartmental working committee with a number of departments . there &apos;s the legal side of things with justice ; distribution with finance .
there are health issues and there are other concerns . that will be something that we will be working on .
we &apos;re probably going to undertake ... .
i don &apos;t want to put any timelines on it , but over the next few months or couple months leading up to september , there are some broad type of community consultations , go out and talk to groups , organizations , and hamlets and get their input , concerns , hear what they have to say , and maybe get some good recommendations on how to proceed .

oral questions .
member for aivilik , mr. steve mapsalak .
question 727 - 4 ( 3 ) : sewage issues in naujaat ( mapsalak )
mr. mapsalak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
my question will be directed to the minister of cgs .
mr. speaker , i had posed this question at an earlier sitting regarding the lack of a sewage lagoon in naujaat . at that time the minister indicated that it was not much of a concern .
when there are studies done , we find that the raw sewage that is seeping into the ocean is way too small to be of concern .
however , there are an increasing number of houses being built in naujaat .
prior to coming here , i went to see the seepage and there &apos;s quite a lot of raw material going into the sea and there &apos;s even a bay or a pond being formed with raw sewage material .
mr. speaker , can the minister indicate to me when it would become a concern and how much of a quantity would have to be seeping into the ocean for it to become a concern ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;ll answer the member &apos;s question this way : it &apos;s not the amount of liquids that would determine what is harmful to the ocean ; it &apos;s what the liquid is .
if you have a water truck spill its whole load into the ocean , nobody would complain , but if you have a sewage truck spill its load to the ocean , then someone would complain and there would be regulations against that . it &apos;s not the amount of sewage that is going into the ocean ; it &apos;s the quality or the condition or how much pollutants are in the liquid that is seeping out from natural sewage lagoons or wetland areas that go into the ocean .
it &apos;s what &apos;s in the water , not the amount of the water .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. mapsalak .
mr. mapsalak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
indeed that may be , but it is rather unsightly to see raw sewage being dumped on the tundra with no designated lagoon .
further , that pond is getting larger due to the sewage dumping in that area .
with that being the situation , the project was deferred or rather it was cut .
i refer to the funding that was allocated for that project for the sewage lagoon . furthermore , it was delayed .
i wonder if the minister could respond to my question on what time frame is involved for this delay . how many years has it been pushed back ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i can &apos;t tell the member exactly how many years it &apos;s postponed . it depends on the natural filtration system that is doing the work it &apos;s supposed to for naujaat .
when the study was done , it was completed last year and the report was issued at the end of 2016 or early 2017 , i believe , to my department .
at that time the current conditions were the natural filtration of the wetlands was doing what it does on its own with sewage that was being pumped there .
the member is right .
there is going to come a point where something would have to be done because the quality of the sewage coming out from the natural filtration wetlands has to be of a certain quality . we can &apos;t just dump raw sewage into the ocean . there are regulations against that .
i can &apos;t tell the member when the time will come , but there will be a time when natural filtration will not work due to the amount of sewage being produced in naujaat .
for now all i can tell the member is that we will monitor the situation and we will revisit the possible sewage lagoon in naujaat in the future .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. mapsalak .
mr. mapsalak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
can the minister inform me of how often the studies are conducted ? is it once a year ? how many times a year do they study the seepage to the ocean ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker . dalhousie university has been doing that study for the natural filtration wetland areas in communities .
they take their samples in the summer . i don &apos;t know exactly the process of how they do it . i &apos;m going to assume they would take the samples where they dump the raw sewage , another one farther out , then farther out , and then farther out &apos; til it &apos;s closest to the ocean .
it &apos;s just done once a season per area , per sewage lagoon . that &apos;s my understanding . the study is usually done just once because the natural filtration system would not change year after year unless something abnormal happened .

oral questions .
member for quttiktuq , mr. isaac shooyook .
question 728 - 4 ( 3 ) : the need for improving boarding home facilities ( shooyook )
mr. shooyook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of health .
we in the baffin region who seek medical attention are facing a lack of space at the tammaativvik boarding home .
patients and pregnant women go here by airplane , and this is a very important issue . there have been serious concerns this year about lack of space at the boarding home .
has the minister looked into alternative solutions to this problem or has he been informed about the lack of space at the boarding home ? when it &apos;s over capacity , clients are put in hotels .
does this not result in increased spending or not ?
i would appreciate it if the minister can describe the problems associated with this issue .
thank you , mr. speaker
speaker : ( interpretation ) thank you .
minister of health , mr. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate the member raising this concern again .
the tammaativvik boarding home here in iqaluit is typically run at 30 percent over capacity , leading to the need to utilize hotels and other facilities , even going so far as to billet people in people &apos;s homes where needs arise .
i have also heard concerns of even when people are in hotels , they may even have to change hotels or change rooms partway through their stay due to bookings . iqaluit is a very busy city and there are different events going on .
we do try to take that into consideration when we make specialist appointments . we look at what specialists needs are coming to the community in addition to what events are being held .
we try not to put any additional strain on infrastructure .
we are in continual discussions with the ownership group and the management at the tammaativvik boarding home to continually look at how we can address this ongoing concern . there is a lack of space in iqaluit , so it is not an overnight solution that we can find .
we do have challenges with the new announcement by the federal government of nihb funding escort travel for maternity travel , which again increases the number of people at these facilities .
that &apos;s a very recent announcement , so we are still gauging the implications of that announcement .
mr. speaker , i realize i &apos;m not answering the question with a solution , but i can assure the member that we &apos;re very aware and we &apos;re in continual dialogue with partners to work towards finding a solution .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. shooyook .
mr. shooyook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , i understand his response .
this is a serious matter for medical travel . i &apos;m not pointing at iqaluit or sanikiluaq .
there are 12 communities that are having real problems with medical travel or with pregnant mothers coming in or those coming here for checkups and those who need cat scans .
with that being the case , there are real challenges with pregnant mothers being able have escorts .
lack of space will become more of a problem in the future and the department of health will have to spend a lot more money .
can the minister and his department and the federal government in ottawa make funding available in 2018 to build a bigger facility than tammaativvik that is run by the government of nunavut ? have you ever considered such a thing ?
it &apos;s a real problem , especially for elders and those with physical disabilities .
as we keep stating , we respect our elders . with that being the case , have you decided what to do about that situation ?
i know funding is hard to come by , but have you ever considered how to acquire a larger boarding home ?
as a minister , have you ever considered that with your department and the government ?
can you clarify that to me ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of health , mr. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
i very much appreciate the member &apos;s comments and his question .
with churchill being the only boarding home that we actually run as a government , the other boarding homes that we utilize , we do on a contract basis through discussions with health canada and non @-@ insured health benefits on establishing rates and contract conditions .
that being said , one of the options that we are considering is looking at how to expand boarding home infrastructure here in iqaluit .
our options are somewhat limited , but it is a very high topic whenever we discuss with the ownership and management of tammaativvik of how they &apos;re going to continue to meet our growing need through the contract conditions that we have with them . it is a continual discussion .
i can use larga baffin in ottawa as an example where they have over the years continuously purchased and managed larger and larger facilities to continue to meet the needs of nunavummiut going to ottawa medical travel .
we &apos;re looking at our partners within the boarding home system along with health canada to see how we can continue to meet the needs of nunavummiut .
the member brings up a very important component specifically to elders . there are limited rooms for people with mobility issues here at tammaativvik .
i guess the unfortunate reality is not only the limitation .
if somebody is in that room , the boarding home management can request those people to relinquish their room for an elder , but we can &apos;t force them to at this time . i hope everyone is listening that , if they &apos;re put in that position , they have the respect for the elder that they would give up their room for an elder . i know i would , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. shooyook .
mr. shooyook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also appreciate the fact this minister responds to questions , as i now understand it better .
yes , i understand the response , mr. speaker .
nonetheless , this is a critical matter .
i now ask the minister if the tammaativvik boarding home is owned by a private business and that the government of nunavut doesn &apos;t own it .
how then do you incorporate the goals that you support when this limitation exists ?
due to the importance of this issue , will this require hotel rooms ?
i know that funding is tight , but i wonder if the government has discussed this need with the hotel owners . has the department of health contemplated purchasing another building due to the capacity issues faced by the current facility ?
this indeed is a very important issue , as many boarders at the facility are experiencing issues due to space limitations , particularly the sector i referenced , the elderly .
how will you develop a goal to ensure , either as the department of health or as this government , that you don &apos;t expend our limited funds on hotel room rentals , enriching the business owners , as is the practice today ?
is this the goal of government or has the department decided on a course of action with the federal government on pursuing the funding of a larger facility ?
has this been taken into consideration ? i wonder if this type of idea will ever be contemplated or if this is part of your current planning .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of health , mr. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
all options are on the table when we &apos;re looking at recognizing the increasing need for boarding home services here in iqaluit specifically .
to show how serious this is , in some respects i can &apos;t answer the member &apos;s full question .
there are negotiations that are continuously ongoing right now that we &apos;re exploring options on how to increase capacity .
unfortunately i can &apos;t , through procurement and any contracting , jeopardize any contracting processes , but just to let members know , it is something that &apos;s very important that we recognize .
we are working with our partners and looking at different options that we can increase capacity . we do rely a lot upon hotels .
at this time it &apos;s not in the capital plan for the department of health to build a new boarding home , but again , all options are being considered .
that &apos;s all i can say for now , mr. speaker .

my questions are for the minister of languages .
last week the federal government announced that it has allocated $ 15.8 million to support and preserve nunavut &apos;s indigenous languages .
in that announcement the federal government indicated that this funding would cover the period from 2016 to 2020 , but no further details about how the funding will be spent were provided .

mr. speaker , in regard to my colleague &apos;s question as to how that money will be allocated , i can say that my department and other agencies of the nunavut government are addressing this issue through the uqausivut plan .

hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
as to the question of the allocation for 2016 @-@ 17 and what that money will be used for , i can &apos;t respond to that right now .
however , in the official languages fund report that i have , i &apos;m sure my officials will be giving me the details of the $ 15.8 million and how it will be allocated .
i would like to explain further about a part of his question . in speaking about the funding allocated for official languages within the authority of the government of nunavut , these are for french , inuktitut , and the other official languages .
this includes funding for the inuit language .
more work can be done for the inuit language because of the availability of that funding . this will provide much support to our inuit language and the fact that it must be recognized and used accordingly .
there are many details .
as per my previous statement , our department will manage this funding and it will allow us to make progress forward . our officials will be able to provide recommendations on how to effectively implement inuktitut or in understanding that their offices must incorporate the inuktitut language .
i am just clarifying that , as the funding is available until 2020 where , under our agreement , we will be administering the funding along with other departments .

i will direct my question to the minister of environment .
mr. speaker , everyone is aware that a caribou quota exists on baffin island , which is capped at 250 caribou for all our communities within the hunting season .
mr. speaker , can the minister provide the information on whether the quota has been reached or how many caribou baffin residents have harvested to date ?
how many caribou have been harvested out of this quota of 250 and are there still any tags available for harvesting caribou in our region ?

hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank mr. keyootak for asking about caribou .
there are currently 229 caribou that have been harvested by residents of baffin island .
since the quota is set at 250 , it means that there are still 21 tags left . the season will end shortly and it will reset on july 1 as it runs from that date up to june 30 .
there are 21 tags available for harvesting up to june 30 .

the other communities have not completed their caribou quota yet .
i would like to inform them that if they don &apos;t get all 250 caribou , then the remaining tags can be given to the communities , even to the communities that have reached their quota .
thank you , mr. speaker .

your final supplementary , mr. keyootak .
mr. keyootak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the minister for explaining that .
mr. speaker , of the 250 caribou that the baffin region can harvest for the whole year , some communities go through their quota really fast . i know some other communities don &apos;t live near caribou populations and it takes a long time to use up their quota .
for this past year i &apos;m sure the entire 250 caribou will be caught .
if the entire 250 caribou are harvested this year , will the quota remain the same next year ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of environment , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , every year the caribou quota has been set at 250 for the qikiqtaaluk region . even if they don &apos;t get all of them or get more than that , once next year comes on july 1 we will make another 250 caribou tags available .
the number of 250 will not be changed until there has been another caribou survey and if they are not decreasing in population . right now it &apos;s going to stay at 250 tags until a further survey has been done to see if it will be increased or decreased .
it will stay at 250 tags for the qikiqtaaluk region for now .

mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .

question 732 - 4 ( 3 ) : tourism ( angnakak )
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are again for the minister of economic development and transportation .
as the minister will recall , she announced in september of last year that her department would be assuming a number of roles and responsibilities that were previously held by nunavut tourism .
as she will also recall , this was a decision that i strongly supported .
earlier this year the legislative assembly approved a budget increase for her department &apos;s tourism and cultural industries division , an increase which included funding for ten new positions .
as of today , what is the status of filling these ten new positions ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank the member for her question . i don &apos;t have that information here with me . ( interpretation ends ) i will have to take that as notice .

i &apos;ll continue on to the next member . ( interpretation ) oral questions .
member for tununiq , mr. joe enook .
question 733 - 4 ( 3 ) : options for government of nunavut infrastructure ( enook )
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the minister of community and government services .
as the minister will recall , nunavut arctic college &apos;s ukiivik residence in iqaluit was severely damaged by fire in the year 2015 .
it is my understanding that this building and the adjoining federal building warehouse are now assets of the department of community and government services .
it is also my understanding that the department has been considering different options for the long @-@ term use of both buildings , and that these options focus on converting the buildings into gn office space .
can the minister confirm what specific options are currently being considered by the government ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the member for the question .
the ukiivik old res. and the federal building are adjoined , but we look at them and treat them as two separate buildings and projects .
right now we are using the federal building and we are looking at maybe changing its purpose to more office space , but that is just being looked at .
the old res . , we &apos;re looking at options there , whether we should demolish it , fix it up , or any other projects that could be used on it . right now there is nothing that we have decided on for both buildings . thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
it is my understanding that it would cost approximately $ 32 million to renovate and modernize the federal building warehouse and that it would cost approximately $ 42 million to renovate and modernize the old nunavut arctic college residence .
is my understanding correct ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;m not sure where those figures came from . i can &apos;t confirm that they are correct or accurate because we have not decided what we are doing with either one of the buildings yet .
until you decide what you &apos;re going to do with a building and what the purpose of it will be , then you can &apos;t get a very accurate figure .
no , the figures are not accurate as of right now . that &apos;s my understanding .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
these are your figures , the government &apos;s figures . thank you for telling me that you have inaccurate figures .
minister , can you confirm if the government is actively considering consolidating its headquarters workforce into a smaller number of buildings than at present , and allowing a number of its existing office space leases to expire ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
just to rebuttal him a little bit there , the figures may be there .
i don &apos;t know what figures he &apos;s talking about , but until we decide on the purpose of a building , then we can &apos;t get an accurate figure on any building .
yes , we are looking at options for office space because the member is right that we own and lease many different office buildings here in iqaluit and lots of the government workers and departments are scattered .
it would be more efficient to get each department in their own building , but as of right now we don &apos;t have an overall plan and that &apos;s partially to do with budgetary restraints .
we are looking at all options .
when a lease is up , we have an option to renew the lease , build our own , or lease another building .
all that stuff is always being looked at .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
oral questions .
member for rankin inlet south , mr. alexander sammurtok .
question 734 - 4 ( 3 ) : rankin inlet &apos;s hamlet office ( sammurtok , a )
mr. alexander sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is to the minister of community and government services .
as the minister is aware , rankin inlet &apos;s hamlet office was recently assessed to determine the extent of the facility &apos;s deterioration .
during our recent winter sitting , the minister stated that his department determined that there was in fact mould present in the facility .
mr. speaker , it is my understanding that the municipality has reached out to the department for support in undertaking mould remediation at the hamlet office .
can the minister tell us what actions his department will be taking to assist the municipality of rankin inlet with this mould remediation project ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i can inform the member that yes , we have been talking with the hamlet with the mould problems in the municipal office there and a company did check it out and there is mould .
what we &apos;re going to do is work with the hamlet to try to remediate the mould come summer . that &apos;s the most update i have right now to help them out with mould remediation .
if that can be done , then the office will still be usable .
if not , then we will look at other options .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. alexander sammurtok .
mr. sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
during our recent winter sitting , the minister stated that his department was helping rankin inlet to find an alternative space for its hamlet operations while a mould remediation project is conducted .
can the minister tell us if an alternative space has been identified as of today ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i myself don &apos;t know right now whether they have an office picked out , but i believe that there is office space available in rankin inlet . while they do the mould remediation , we would help the hamlet out in finding alternative space . in the event that mould remediation does not work , we would also help them find alternative office space .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. alexander sammurtok .
mr. sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
mould remediation and renovations to the current facility are short @-@ term solutions to a long @-@ term problem , which is that the hamlet office in rankin inlet is aged , deteriorated , and no longer sufficient to meet the operational needs of the community &apos;s growing population .
can the minister tell us when we can expect to see a project of construction of a new hamlet office in rankin inlet in the government &apos;s capital plan ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
the member is correct in saying that the hamlet office in rankin inlet is old and it &apos;s small .
i have met there with the council and yes , they definitely have outgrown their office space .
currently it &apos;s not in the five @-@ year capital plan and i hope to be back here next year so that we can try to make sure we get into the community plan . right now it &apos;s not in there .
on a side note , rankin inlet is getting a new arena and their old arena may be able to change its purpose for that . i &apos;m not sure , but that &apos;s one of the options that probably could be looked at in the interim .
we &apos;re open to all options . we know that we have to help out the municipality of rankin inlet in terms of giving them adequate space .
i can &apos;t promise or commit to anything right now , but we &apos;re there to help them .
thank you , mr. speaker .

oral questions .
member for gjoa haven , mr. tony akoak .
question 735 - 4 ( 3 ) : franklin expedition ( akoak )
mr. akoak : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the minister of culture and heritage .
earlier this month the federal minister responsible for parks canada responded to a question asked in the house of commons concerning the discovery of the lost ships of the franklin expedition .
as the minister is aware , the wrecks are located in my constituency near the community of gjoa haven .
in her response the federal minister indicated that parks canada is working with the inuit heritage trust to &quot; establish joint ownership of the artifacts . &quot; she also made reference to the government of nunavut .
mr. speaker , can our minister clarify what role the government of nunavut has in this process ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of culture and heritage , mr. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
with respect to his question regarding the discovery of the lost ships , we worked together with the federal government and other entities , especially the community of gjoa haven . after the discovery of the shipwrecks , we had a close working relationship with the people of gjoa haven .
if i understood his question correctly , he is asking what role the government has in this regard .
mr. speaker , i can indicate to the member that we have other plans to ... . i &apos;m not sure what that body of water near gjoa haven is called . mr. speaker , we are going to be responsible for the work on that body of water , getting the required permits , and so on .
whether we are working with the federal government or non @-@ governmental organizations , the nunavut government is going to take the leadership role in work related to the ships that have been found .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. akoak .
mr. akoak : thank you , mr. speaker .
as the minister is aware , the community of gjoa haven sees great tourism potential associated with the discovery of the franklin expedition ships .
we want the community of gjoa haven to benefit from this . can the minister describe how he is working with the minister of economic development and transportation to assist the community in this area ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of culture and heritage , mr. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
the department of economic development and transportation also has other sectors which include nunavut tourism and cruise ships going through nunavut waters .
mr. speaker , the department of culture and heritage could work together with the department of economic development and transportation and their tourism sector .
as it relates to the findings of the ships , we can work together , but i &apos;m not sure which divisions of our departments are going to be working on it .
if there are any plans , i will discuss this with my ministerial colleague and our officials . i will be able to respond to your question in detail at a later date .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. akoak .
mr. akoak : thank you , mr. speaker . as the minister is aware , there has been controversy associated with the permitting process associated with the search for the lost franklin ships , including disputes involving the government of nunavut , parks canada , and the arctic research foundation .
for the record , can the minister clarify the government of nunavut &apos;s position on this matter ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of culture and heritage , mr. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
i can &apos;t respond to the question at this time because there are a lot of entities involved with this matter .

oral questions .
member for south baffin , mr. david joanasie .
question 736 - 4 ( 3 ) : departmental vacancies ( joanasie )
mr. joanasie ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
before i go to my question , i would like to welcome my teacher from nunavut sivuniksavut , which was established in 1985 .
murray angus was my teacher and now that he is semi @-@ retired , i would like to welcome him to the house .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , my questions are for the minister of finance , who is the chairperson of the financial management board .
the government of nunavut &apos;s most recent quarterly employment report indicates that approximately 1,285 positions were vacant as of march 31 , 2017 .
this represents a vacancy rate of approximately 27 percent .
ten years ago the vacancy rate was only 20 percent .
can the minister indicate what specific factors have accounted for the increase in the vacancy rate ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of finance , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
it &apos;s pretty simple . the government of nunavut has been creating a lot of new jobs and of course we strive for 85 percent inuit employment . people have to be qualified for those jobs and a lot of the jobs that are being created are highly technical .
as mr. joanasie is aware , in the berger report 2006 , berger recommended education as a key issue . the office of the auditor general of canada , in their 2010 report , said the same thing .
we need to get our grads up . people have to get into post @-@ secondary and qualify for the jobs .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. joanasie .
mr. joanasie : thank you , mr. speaker .
the government of nunavut &apos;s most recent quarterly employment report indicates that there were a total of approximately 4,788 positions across the entire government as of march 31 , 2017 .
ten years ago the government only had 3,687 positions .
this represents an increase of over 1,100 positions , or almost 30 percent , in the span of just ten years .
if the government cannot fill almost a quarter of its existing positions , why does the financial management board continue to allow departments to add new positions to their organizational charts ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of finance , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
if the entire population of nunavut lived in one or two communities - i think it is 37,000 - it would be so much easier to provide government and public services . if you take a small town down south of 37,000 people , they &apos;ve got a mayor , council , let &apos;s say eight or nine people running an entire community , and maybe they &apos;ve got a thousand employees . i &apos;m just guessing .
in nunavut , just looking at some stats , 11 percent of our population is providing services in nunavut . we all live in 25 communities . twenty @-@ five communities need health centres , one or two schools , community councils , and other services .
the more communities you have and you have 37,000 people stretched across three time zones , then you have to provide the same services in those communities but not to such extent , let &apos;s say , you have in iqaluit .
obviously we don &apos;t have hospitals in cambridge bay or kugluktuk . you have one here .
you have to staff these positions . you can &apos;t have one community getting all the services and other communities getting a quarter or 20 percent of the services .
mr. speaker , the government is asked to provide services to nunavummiut and mlas encourage it . we work with the communities , we work with all the nunavummiut , we prepare business cases , and the departments come to the financial management board .
we don &apos;t approve everything , but then we come in this house and we debate it . the main estimates and capital estimates get approved in this house .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. david joanasie .
mr. joanasie : thank you , mr. speaker .
as i noted earlier , the government of nunavut &apos;s most recent quarterly employment report indicates that approximately 1,285 positions were vacant as of march 31 , 2017 .
i understand the minister &apos;s response about education is the key .
in order for the population to be employed , they need to have the skills and requirements . also looking at the vacancy rate , it can span so many years .
i would like to test the minister to see if he can indicate approximately how many of the vacant positions have been sitting vacant for five years or more .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of finance , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would love to be able to answer that question .
as he can appreciate , i &apos;ve got gazillions of pieces of information rolling around in my head and sometimes the answers are not immediately there .
i can tell mr. joanasie that even though on the inuit employment stats an indeterminate job is indicated vacant , many of those positions are filled by casuals who are not maybe providing 100 percent of the level of service in that position .
they would be providing a reduced level of service .
while those positions may be vacant , they &apos;re actually quite often staffed by casuals .
we put a lot of effort into it on this side , encouraging our departments to identify casuals who have been in positions for a significant length of time .
it could be , let &apos;s say for example , as long as five years . i don &apos;t know if there are that many in there now . if a person is a casual in a position is doing a good job , they &apos;ve had good performance appraisals , they have been learning on the job , they have gained experience , they know the job , and their boss or supervisor is satisfied with them that they &apos;re performing well , then we actively encourage them to put forward a request for a direct appointment .
direct appointments are approved by cabinet and we quite regularly do that .
