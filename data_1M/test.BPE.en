minister &apos;s statement 319 - 4 ( 3 ) : training travel fund to support article 23 ( taptuna )
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ) good afternoon , my colleagues , nunavummiut , and kuglukturmiut .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , the government of nunavut encourages public servants to continually develop their knowledge and skills through job or career related training .
my department delivers a variety of short courses in various communities throughout the year for public servants to access professional development closer to home .
however , there are times when employees have to leave their communities to attend job @-@ related training and we know how expensive travel costs are in nunavut .
mr. speaker , this year departments and public agencies will be able to apply to the department of executive and intergovernmental affairs to access a training travel fund for their inuit employees who have to travel outside of their community to take a job or career related training .
mr. speaker , this program will assist departments and public bodies in implementing their detailed inuit employment plans by supporting training and development plans for their inuit employees .
the training travel fund will be using a combination of internal gn funds and funds set aside from the settlement agreement .
mr. speaker , the goal of the training travel fund is to increase both the number of inuit employees who take job and career related training and the amount of training they access .
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister &apos;s statement 320 - 4 ( 3 ) : income assistance re@@ forms ( mike )
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i am grateful that we have this opportunity once again . good day to the people of nunavut and pangnirtung .
mr. speaker , i am pleased to stand here today to update the members on the progress my department has made in implementing the re@@ forms to income assistance in nunavut .
( interpretation ends ) in sivumut abluqta our government committed to reviewing and re@@ forming our approach to income assistance .
this was done to ensure that those who truly need support receive that support . ( interpretation ) mr. speaker , today i am proud to announce that the first phase of improvements will come into effect on july 1 , 2017 .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , the old process did not provide an incentive for clients to work because their income assistance benefits were reduced by a dollar for every dollar of income they made over the earned income limit .
as such , to encourage nunavummiut to seek employment and earn more of their own income , the limit of the amount of money that clients can earn from employment while on income assistance has been raised .
( interpretation ) building upon this change , clients will also now be able to take the money they have earned from employment and save it in their bank account .
previously nunavummiut were forced to spend all of their savings in order to qualify for assistance .
this made it difficult for clients to get off income assistance and become financially independent .
this change will allow clients to save for emergencies .
( interpretation ends ) finally , as we are aware , some nunavummiut are unable to work due to a long @-@ term or short @-@ term disability .
we need to better support these individuals so that they can live full , productive lives . to accomplish this , we have increased the disability allowance to $ 250 per month for people with disabilities las@@ ting a year or longer and have introduced a short @-@ term disability allowance of $ 125 per month for people with disabilities las@@ ting 6 to 12 months .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker , i am proud of these re@@ forms our government is making for our income assistance program and i look forward to the continued progress that will be made on this important commitment .
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister &apos;s statement 321 - 4 ( 3 ) : mobile addictions treatment in cambridge bay ( hickes )
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to share exciting developments regarding addictions treatment in the territory .
on may 21 , 2017 a group of seven men emb@@ ar@@ ked on a journey towards recovery from addictions . they are attending the mobile addictions treatment program delivered by the cambridge bay wellness centre .
mr. speaker , for 28 days the group will be living at a healing centre set up on the land . local elders participated in incorporating iq , inuit societal values , and inuit traditions in the design of the program .
among other things the addictions program considers the role of relationships , family , and gri@@ ef in the healing process .
the nunavut suicide prevention strategy partners secured funding from health canada &apos;s program for indigenous suicide prevention for two deli@@ veri@@ es : one for men in the spring and one for women in the fall of 2017 . the program was developed and pilo@@ ted in 2012 by the department of health and the cambridge bay wellness centre .
today this collaboration continues with support provided by staff from the mental health and addictions division , the municipality , and local organizations .
mr. speaker , this program is just one option that is part of our growing focus on in @-@ territory treatment . in communities we have mental health and addiction staff working with clients to minimize the har@@ ms associated with their substance use through one @-@ on @-@ one counselling .
we also provide funding for communities to run alcohol and drug programs that address both prevention and treatment .
efforts will continue to focus on building addiction treatment capacity within nunavut .
i invite my colleagues to join me in congratulating the cambridge bay wellness centre in making this program a reality .
above all , however , it is the determination of these seven men to emb@@ ark on a journey towards recovery that must be salu@@ ted .
thank you , mr. speaker .

hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
good day to the residents of my community , nunavummiut , and visitors in the gallery .
mr. speaker , i rise today to speak about the first ever educational leadership course that will be offered in inuktitut to inuktitut @-@ speaking educators on july 15 to 20 .
this certificate of educational leadership in nunavut course leads to principal certification and a graduate degree
mr. speaker , my department has been working with the university of prince edward island on the development and delivery of a fully inuktitut course on educational leadership .
this course focuses on the development of collaborative relationships , positive communication , and empowerment of parents , elders , and community members who lead , support , and guide education in nunavut .
mr. speaker , all inuktitut @-@ speaking educators in a nunavut teachers association position are eligible to apply for this graduate level course .
mr. speaker , applications are still being accepted until june 18 , so i encourage my fellow members to share this information and wonderful opportunity with your communities .
mr. speaker , this program is one of the ways by which my department supports , em@@ powers , and encourages our inukti@@ tut@@ - speaking educators and i am truly proud to share this news with you today .

hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i say &quot; good day &quot; to the people of arviat .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , i rise today to provide an update on community infrastructure projects in nunavut . the department of community and government services has done a lot of work in the complex process of improving infrastructure in municipalities within nunavut .
i am pleased to report that we are seeing the results of this work .
i recently welcomed the hon. ama@@ r@@ je@@ et so@@ hi to nunavut on his first visit to our territory as the federal minister of infrastructure and communities .
we took part in a major announcement for $ 207 million in joint funding for 31 projects to upgrade solid waste management , water and wastewater systems throughout the territory .
this funding helps municipalities meet their compliance requirements for environmental regulations and this is another step forward in the government of nunavut &apos;s plan to support communities .
during his meetings with the government of nunavut and the nunavut association of municipalities , minister so@@ hi was given a better appreciation of these major files .
this meeting has helped us maintain our mo@@ men@@ tu@@ m in identifying nunavut &apos;s infrastructure needs . our next steps are to follow up with research , planning , project management , and the funding structures to ensure those needs are being met .
the hon. johnny mike and the hon. keith peterson joined us on a trip to pangnirtung , where we visited the new water and wastewater facility , municipal wh@@ ar@@ f , fish plant , and the new power plant .
minister so@@ hi was able to see first @-@ hand the major impacts and positive effects of government investments in infrastructure in the communities .
he also saw what is lacking for land@@ f@@ ills , internet conne@@ cti@@ vity , recreation facilities , and transportation and this was very valuable in his understanding of the needs in the communities .
i am grateful for this opportunity to contribute to economic development , environmental protection , and the building of healthy communities for las@@ ting benefits for nunavummiut .

hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i again rise in the house today to inform my fellow members of the progress and great initiatives that are being taken by piqqusilirivvik .
i &apos;ll be speaking in english .
( interpretation ends ) last summer piqqusilirivvik instructors and students travelled to igloolik , where they participated in a walrus hunt .
as part of the hunt they learned how to prepare ig@@ unaq ( fer@@ men@@ ted walrus meat ) .
just a few weeks ago the instructors and students completed the cycle of learning by returning to igloolik to re@@ tri@@ eve the ig@@ unaq which they are now sharing with elders and community members in clyde river but also elsewhere , including iqaluit .
students at piqqusilirivvik visited elders at their homes in the community to foster relationships . during the visits , students helped the elders with household cho@@ res and also interviewed them , listened to stories , and practi@@ sed hands @-@ on skills such as sewing .
the students incorporated the knowledge and experiences they gathered into independent research projects , which they presented back to the elders at the conclusion of the elders &quot; feast that followed .
mr. speaker , the piqqusilirivvik program is not only unique ; it is an inspir@@ ational experience with life @-@ changing outcomes for the students who participate .
through this program and the experiences acquired , we are providing opportunities for nunavummiut to learn and maintain our traditional knowledge and share it in a con@@ temporary setting . ( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. speaker , last fall i rose to inform the house of a new agreement that had been signed between the nunavut housing corporation and the federal government for investment of almost $ 85 million over two years for housing in nunavut .
mr. speaker , today i am pleased to provide my colleagues with an update on the implementation of this funding .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , contracts have been awarded for construction of 90 brand @-@ new public housing units across the territory .
construction will begin this summer and completion of these units is expected by the fall of 2018 .
a further 95 units will also be contracted for the second year of the funding implementation . these new units will be critical to filling the significant housing gap faced by our territory .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker , significant federal funding has also been dedicated to repair and renovate women &apos;s shelters in iqaluit and rankin inlet .
work is well underway in the shelters and will continue over the summer .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , over $ 1 million ... .
speaker ( interpretation ) : my apologies . ( interpretation ends ) hon. minister , the time for ministers &quot; statements is over .

hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker . i also thank my colleagues .
i didn &apos;t realize that my time had run out .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , over $ 1 million is also being used from federal and gn funding to make much @-@ needed upgrades to elders centres in iqaluit and arviat .
as our population ages , the importance of having well @-@ maintained elders facilities gro@@ ws .
finally this federal funding , along with gn funding , has allowed the nhc to complete a mould assessment project to address nunavut &apos;s most affected public housing units .
a total of 271 units were assessed across the territory .
where mould was found , these units will be remedi@@ ated either by local housing staff or , where necessary , trained experts who will be contracted .
mr. speaker , i am very pleased with the progress that has been made to implement this federal funding to improve the housing situation of nunavummiut .
i look forward to updating my colleagues again as we continue to lobby and negotiate for further federal funding to address nunavut &apos;s housing crisis .
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. mikkungwak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to remind nunavummiut to use social media responsib@@ ly .
mr. speaker , there are many opportunities for individuals and communities to benefit from the accessib@@ ility of social media .
social media sites allow us to connect with loved ones over long dis@@ tan@@ ces , share concerns within the community , and advertise local initiatives and events .
however , as our society becomes more technologi@@ cally advanced , we also become more vulnerable in a number of ways .
with the adv@@ ent of cy@@ ber@@ bullying and live stream@@ ing , it is now more important than ever for us to practise safe and responsible internet use .
mr. speaker , i want to remind our vie@@ wers today of the power that dama@@ ging or disturbing content may have on other individuals in their communities .
think hard about the consequences before you post comments , photos , or vide@@ os that may affect others in a har@@ m@@ ful way .
if you notice har@@ m@@ ful content on a particular site , it is your responsibility to report that content to the site administrators , if possible .
i would also like to remind our vie@@ wers that any statements that we may post on the internet will not be private and may represent how the world per@@ ce@@ ives us inde@@ fin@@ itely .
mr. speaker , i recognize that the government and law enforcement agencies have limited control over what content may or may not be shared by an individual on the internet .
however , i would like to encourage the government and royal canadian moun@@ ted police to increase their efforts to educate the public on how to use the internet and social media in a safe and responsible manner .

question :
mr. speaker , on may 31 mla iqaluit @-@ niaqunnguu pat angnakak asked , &quot; earlier this year the legislative assembly approved a budget increase for her department &apos;s tourism and cultural industries division , an increase which included funding for 10 positions .

answer :
mr. speaker , the current status of the 10 new positions is as follows :
three visitor centre coordinator positions are filled in iqaluit , rankin inlet , and pangnirtung .
the cambridge bay visitor centre coordinator position will go to competition once the manager of the visitor experience position , to which it reports , is filled .
two positions , the marketing manager and divisional assistant , were posted and the job ads for both closed on june 2 . these positions should be filled by this summer .
four positions were sent to staffing earlier this year : the market and research analy@@ st , the manager , visitor experience , as well as regional tourism coordinators in kugluktuk and iqaluit . these will be posted as soon as possible .

item 6 : oral questions
question 7@@ 63 - 4 ( 3 ) : out @-@ of @-@ territory support services ( angnakak )
ms. angnakak : thank you .
yes , i know , ladies first .
good afternoon , everybody .
mr. speaker , i would like to direct my question to the minister of health .
mr. speaker , the minister may recall that in october of 2016 he indicated that he would provide further detail on contracts negotiated with organizations in other jurisdictions which provide assistance and support services for nunavut medical clients .
as i never did receive the detailed information that the minister said he was going to provide , i would like to take this opportunity now to follow up on this issue .
my first question is : can the minister provide an update on the current status of contracts with such entities as the ottawa health services network , also known as o@@ h@@ s@@ ni , which provide services to nunavut medical clients when they travel outside of the territory ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of health , hon. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
first i must apologize to the member . i must have obviously negle@@ cted to follow up with the member and i &apos;ll make a note of that .
with the ottawa health services network incorporated , the end date of that current contract is april 1 , 20@@ 21 . there are five years of extension available .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;m still m@@ ull@@ ing that number over in my head . that &apos;s a long contract .
mr. speaker , medical clients from the qikiqtaaluk region generally travel to ottawa to receive health services that cannot be provided in nunavut .
o@@ h@@ s@@ ni provides a number of services to assist with this process .
can the minister identify which entities are responsible for providing similar services for nunavummiut who travel to winnipeg , edmonton , and yellowknife ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of health , mr. hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
basically in a nut@@ shell , we don &apos;t have any other jurisdictions that provide or have the services provided such as o@@ h@@ s@@ ni provides for ( interpretation ) residents of baffin ( interpretation ends ) that go down to ottawa .
it &apos;s kind of piece @-@ worked together . basically the boarding homes look after a lot of the services on medical , not just boarding but transportation to and from their appointments , and interpretation services available through those facilities . an all @-@ encompas@@ sing contract does not exist for the other two regions .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
as the minister will recall , in october of 2016 he stated that he would provide details regarding all the contracts with out @-@ of @-@ territory entities which provide services to medical clients who travel to other jurisdictions for health care .
will the minister commit to providing that information to members of the legislative assembly at the earliest opportunity ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of health , mr. hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , i &apos;ll go through the contract information that i have available and will provide it to the members .

question 7@@ 64 - 4 ( 3 ) : grise fiord municipal complex ( shooyook )
mr. shooyook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the minister of community and government services .
last month the speaker of the legislative assembly and the commissioner of nunavut visited grise fiord .
the mayor and the municipal council hosted a community feast for our visitors .
this successful event was held at the municipal complex , which includes the community &apos;s gymnasium .
the community is grateful for the new municipal complex , which was opened in 2014 .
however , concerns have been raised that the facility lac@@ ks an adequate sp@@ rink@@ ler system .
can the minister confirm what his department is doing to address the concern ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank my colleague for asking that question .
with respect to the building that my colleague is referring to , the sp@@ rink@@ ler system was not included when the building was designed and built .
it is being looked at right now to see if the sp@@ rink@@ ler system can be installed in the building .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. shooyook .
mr. shooyook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . thank you for saying that some thought has been put into this matter .
can the minister indicate how often the facility is inspected by officials to ensure that it meets with all fire code requirements ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of community and government services , hon. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like the member to repeat the question . i believe he &apos;s asking about inspections by fire officials .
can he please repeat the question ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
member for quttiktuq , mr. shooyook , please rephrase your question .
mr. shooyook ( interpretation ) : as i stated , can the minister indicate how often the facility is inspected by officials to ensure that it meets with all fire code requirements ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
facilities such as daycares , schools , hamlet offices , and buildings that are not privately owned like ( interpretation ends ) commercial buildings ( interpretation ) are supposed to be inspected annually .
i can &apos;t tell the member right now if they have actually been inspected every year , but they are supposed to be inspected every year .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. shooyook .
mr. shooyook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
concerns have also been raised that the facility &apos;s heating system is not working properly in all areas of the building .
can the minister confirm what his department is doing to address the concern ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
my apologies . can the member specify which building he is referring to that has a heating system not working properly ?
is it the municipal complex that he referred to , the community hall ?
can he please indicate which building he is referring to ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
member for quttiktuq , mr. shooyook , please clarify .
mr. shooyook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . you already understood my question .
i am referring to the hamlet complex which also has a gym .
the heating system in that building is not working properly .
i hope you understand that now .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
the hamlet buildings are handled by the hamlets and their maintenance workers deal with that , but i can tell the member that i will look into this matter . however , it is a hamlet building , so the hamlet is responsible for that .

question 7@@ 65 - 4 ( 3 ) : contracting and procurement ( sammurtok , a )
mr. alexander sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the minister of community and government services .
i want to revisit the issue of contracting and procurement . as the minister is aware , concerns have been raised about his department &apos;s awarding of certain as @-@ and @-@ when maintenance contracts to companies located outside of nunavut .
mr. speaker , contracts that are issued by the nunavut housing corporation can include minimum inuit labour requirements .
can the minister indicate whether or not the as @-@ and @-@ when maintenance contracts that are issued by his department include a requirement for southern companies to hire a minimum number of local workers ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i can inform the members that the as @-@ and @-@ when contracts do have minimum inuit requirement conditions . depending on the contract , the minimum percentage of inuit employment can be different .
in short , yes , there is a minimum requirement for all as @-@ and @-@ when contracts .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. alexander sammurtok .
mr. sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
contracts that are issued by the nunavut housing corporation can include requirements for companies to fund training for inuit workers .
in fact the nunavut housing corporation provides money to the contractors to fund training .
can the minister indicate whether or not as @-@ and @-@ when maintenance contracts that are issued by his department include a requirement for companies to provide training to local apprentices and / or students ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of community and government services , hon. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;m not aware of any as @-@ and @-@ when contracts where it &apos;s a requirement that they have to train anyone .
as the contract states , it &apos;s as and when . you &apos;re not sure when you &apos;re going to get work , how much work you &apos;re going to get , and when it &apos;s going to be . i know of some contractors that do have as @-@ and @-@ when that do have apprentices .
i would think that in part of the evaluating process , all of that would be looked at , but i don &apos;t know for sure if there are any requirements that they have to have a training component . in fact i would say that there probably isn &apos;t , but i can get back to the member on that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. alexander sammurtok .
mr. sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
as the members of rankin inlet north and iqaluit @-@ niaqunnguu have both pointed out in recent days , the government &apos;s new nni policy now provides for additional bid adjustments for inuit firms with higher inuit ownership levels .
however , neither the minister of economic development and transportation nor the minister of cgs appear to have been provided with an updated list of inuit firms by nti which includes their new r@@ at@@ ings .
my question to the minister is this : how can the government calcul@@ ate bid adjustments when awarding contracts if it has not been provided with this new information ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i think a lot or most of the as @-@ and @-@ when contracts that were just issued were all issued on the old nni policy . that list of the old nni policy would have been current until the end of march 31 , 2017 .
the new nni policy was effective april 1 , 2017 .
any contracts that were going to be in the fiscal year from april 1 , 2017 until march 31 , 2018 , the tenders would have been out and given out when the old nni policy was still enacted . those bids would be under the old nni policy .

question 7@@ 66 - 4 ( 3 ) : supports for parenting ( joanasie )
mr. joanasie ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
good afternoon to my colleagues , people of cape dorset and kimmirut , and nunavummiut .
mr. speaker , today i would like to direct my question to the minister of family services .
mr. speaker , various events in the recent history of the people of nunavut have resulted in major dis@@ conne@@ cts between generations and the loss of traditional family roles often leads to a lack of understanding of family dy@@ nami@@ cs .
i would like to ask the minister if he can provide an update on what kinds of supports and services his department makes available to parents , especially young parents , who are struggling with raising their children .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of family services , mr. johnny mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank my colleague for asking that question .
yes , this issue of parental responsibility offered through the department of family services is what we have focused on through the in@@ unngu@@ iniq stream , as it is called .
it is geared towards teaching proper child re@@ aring practices , including the roles of the father and mother in raising their children . this includes various stages of child growth .
the department of family services was engaged in this course due to the reason of teaching cultural steps through the in@@ unngu@@ iniq program . due to this fact , our department provided training on the in@@ unngu@@ iniq program last year to ensure younger parents can raise their children properly .
this program training was successful and it taught child re@@ aring and parental responsibilities to the facilita@@ tors who will provide the training for the parents .
that is what we have attemp@@ ted as the department of family services to date .
as well , this is considered important due to the inuit who wish to incorporate traditional re@@ aring practices as an independent family .
yes , i can indicate today that that &apos;s the work we have done in the department of family services .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. joanasie .
mr. joanasie ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , a serious issue that is faced by many parents is how to discipline their children .
can the minister clarify whether or not his department creates , publi@@ sh@@ es , or makes available any resources or programs to help young parents address discipline issues with their children ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of family services , hon. johnny mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank my colleague for asking that question .
if i understood his question correctly , yes , the department of family services has tried to offer two avenues due to this issue .
it is up to local organizations that wish to be involved that can apply for funding under this subject related to child re@@ aring in a culturally appropriate manner .
the second area involves the researchers who are studying health issues related to child re@@ aring .
due to this reason , this in@@ unngu@@ iniq training will result in capable advis@@ ors within nunavut .
this is how we try to ensure training in child re@@ aring is provided .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. joanasie .
mr. joanasie ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
it is a sad fact that a number of youth in nunavut suffer from behavi@@ our@@ al challenges .
this is seen in our schools , in the rates of vand@@ alism and ar@@ son , and in those unfortunate incidents where situations escal@@ ate out of control .
will the minister commit to reviewing the statistics , the reports , and the testimony of frontline youth workers and bring forward supports and resources to help parents with children who have behavi@@ our@@ al challenges ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of family services , mr. johnny mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
as per my previous comment , work has progres@@ sed but is still required for 2017 @-@ 18 on completing this work due to the reason of including in@@ unngu@@ iniq . this is under the mandate of the department of family services .
regarding the member &apos;s suggestion , i can agree to try to provide an analysis of the issue that he raised related to social inter@@ active programs such as child re@@ aring and so on .
with the loss of the traditional teaching pl@@ at@@ forms , we notice , for example , the case of the cape dorset ar@@ son committed at the school .
the department of family services is involved with this program , along with other departments to try to resolve this issue , at least that i am aware of .
to elaborate , what we are dealing with here as a department is more on child re@@ aring practices under inuit cultural stages . due to these reasons , we must ensure inuit culture is believed , that the knowledge is foun@@ ded on proven principles of raising a properly soci@@ alized inuk .
as per my earlier comments , the facilita@@ tors will receive further training during this fiscal year .
it seems obvious to me that we will find more information as we push to implement these principles or to ensure that recommendations submitted regarding concerns are the reason for cultural training of becoming an inuk and proper child re@@ aring techniques for fathers or mothers .

i was out of the territory recently for several days . this trip served as a les@@ son on issues we should be aware of in our homes as what we experience teach@@ es us new methods .
mr. speaker , one of the places we stayed at un@@ know@@ ingly resulted in my physical condition changing in an experience i have never had before , so i learn@@ t from that experience .
i un@@ know@@ ingly experienced head@@ ach@@ es and loss of bre@@ ath , which i have never felt previously .
it was only when we left the room that i found out that it was due to being ex@@ posed to mould .
i have heard about people getting head@@ ach@@ es .
i resear@@ ched this subject where i found if you brea@@ the in mould , it can cause head@@ ach@@ es and it can enter your l@@ ung@@ s .
apparently mould th@@ ri@@ ves on fl@@ our and su@@ ga@@ r .
if it en@@ ters your body , it can grow inside .
if you stop eating food conta@@ ining fl@@ our and su@@ ga@@ r , the mould starts d@@ ying off .
the member for gjoa haven asked the minister questions on how the remediation of mould would be undertaken by the housing corporation .
i would further encourage the minister and ask him this question . have the tenants currently resi@@ ding in mo@@ ul@@ dy units been advised of the potential health impacts of mould and how it can result in to@@ xi@@ city or sick@@ ness ? that is my first question to the minister .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation , hon. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
we are aware of the importance of the issue the member raises . our partners who own these public housing units are the local housing organizations .
our corporation and the lhos have maintained contact on this health concern .
with respect to tenant information about the mould , it included other dangers that grow in d@@ am@@ p conditions such as mil@@ dew , which requires d@@ amp@@ ness to grow , resulting in mo@@ ul@@ dy conditions .
this is what the lhos and our corporation is working together on . the workers received training on mould remediation and proper cleanup techniques .
the units that harbour mould is the reason we have provided the information publicly on a calendar on possible health concerns and explo@@ red other ways to have tenants be aware of mould .
that is what we are attempting to undertake . this is to ensure tenants are aware of this issue , if they occup@@ y public housing units that may be su@@ sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ ble to mould and possible effects on the health of our tenants .
thank you very much , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. okalik .
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
there were over 200 units identified for mould remediation within nunavut based on the previous statements about these housing units . i imagine some units are still occupied .
i wonder if the minister can indicate whether past tenants or current tenants of mould @-@ inf@@ ested units have been properly informed about the dangers .
in fact health professionals often mis@@ diagn@@ ose mould illnesses .
i wonder if this minister will publicly inform the tenants through their corporate offices on the possible health effects on the human body .
will your corporation commit to trans@@ mi@@ tting this critical information to the tenants who live in mo@@ ul@@ dy housing units ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation , mr. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
indeed the member is correct in his statement .
with respect to the units that the lhos manage , after there was a territorial study on the mould contamination and the number of units affected , 271 housing units were initially identified .
yes , for all of nunavut , there are 271 housing units that were inspected for possible mould contamination . the inspection allocated a level which was comprised of ( interpretation ends ) level 1 , 2 , or 3 ( interpretation ) inf@@ esta@@ tions within the unit . this indicated the level of mould found .
with respect to the actual question , yes , the tenants will be informed and whether they require relocation while the cleanup crew is remedi@@ ating their housing unit . depending on the level of the mould , the cleanup would be undertaken either by the local housing maintain@@ er group or through a contractor . that is how it will be done .
if our staff can &apos;t clean up the mould , we will make sure to contract experts to do the cleaning . we will be informing our housing tenants .

my questions are for the minister of health .
during yesterday &apos;s sitting of the legislative assembly , i tabled a copy of my recent exchange of correspondence concerning firearms safety and training programs in nunavut .
the correspondence that i received from the government indicated that the department of health has , and i quote , &quot; collabor@@ ated with the rcmp to provide funding and administrative support to strengthen and expand the coverage of the canadian firearms safety course ( c@@ f@@ s@@ c ) . &quot;

question 7@@ 69 - 4 ( 3 ) : status of coral harbour school play@@ ground ( mapsalak )
mr. mapsalak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of education . i &apos;m sure he will recall the dialogue we had between us in regard to the lack of play@@ grounds in coral harbour .
i &apos;m not sure how many years have passed , but a few years ago coral harbour received funding for a new play@@ ground .
however , to date nothing has been done and the school children have nowhere to play . there &apos;s absolutely no play@@ ground that has been put up yet .
that &apos;s still the case today . the dea has made repeated requests on when the play@@ ground will be constructed .
can the minister provide an update on what is being done to ensure that there is a functioning and safe play@@ ground for coral harbour &apos;s school@@ children ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of education , mr. paul quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank my colleague for bringing up that subject again .
we know the status of that project .
the play@@ ground material was brought up to coral harbour in 2014 .
they were bought by the s@@ akku school in 2014 and in 2016 they did try to start setting up the play@@ ground .
we contracted g@@ c north construction in july 2016 and the crew went to coral harbour to set up the play@@ ground .
at that time there was no foundation material , so we had to order it .
it did arrive to coral harbour , but when they started taking out the play@@ ground material , we found that there was the@@ ft involved .
there were no na@@ ils and other required material to build the play@@ ground , so the construction couldn &apos;t begin in 2016 .
we had to re@@ order the missing materials . the missing materials did come in during the fall , but the construction couldn &apos;t be completed in 2016 due to the weather .
to date all the required material is in the community and we expect that they will start constructing the play@@ ground on august 12 , 2017 in coral harbour .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. mapsalak .
mr. mapsalak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank the minister for clearly indicating that they will be working on the play@@ ground . it is obvious that our constituents hear such responses , so they have heard what the issues were .
since the minister indicated that the work will be undertaken , i wonder how it will be done .
he also mentioned that the materials are now complete and that the replacements for the missing items that were sto@@ len have arrived .
is august the actual date for the construction to commence and has this information been rela@@ yed to the dea in coral harbour ?
is the date of construction firm and can assistance be provided to acquire the play@@ ground equipment ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of education , hon. paul quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
absolutely , as i stated previously , august 12 is the scheduled construction start date and i imagine that the project will be completed shortly after . we have informed g@@ c north construction of the requirement .
to elaborate , other communities will also get play@@ ground equipment . for example , baker lake , cambridge bay , hall beach , kugluktuk , naujaat , and pond inlet will have their play@@ ground construction projects commen@@ cing this fall .
there is always a need for play@@ grounds within our schools , so that is why i wanted to elaborate on that .

mr. akoak : thank you , mr. speaker .
good afternoon to ( interpretation ) the residents of gjoa haven ( interpretation ends ) and all the people of nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker . my questions are for the minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation .
mr. speaker , the nunavut housing corporation &apos;s tender package for the construction of 20 new public housing units in gjoa haven closed on march 10 of 2017 .
the community is very much looking forward to these desperately needed new units .
mr. speaker , for the record , can the minister confirm which company has been awarded the contract for the construction ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation , hon. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker . i also thank the member for asking that question .

your first supplementary , mr. akoak .
mr. akoak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i was pleased to note that the tender documents indicate that the prescribed minimum level of inuit labour as a percentage of total labour by dollar value for this construction will be 25 percent .
has gjoa haven &apos;s local housing association been made aware of this requirement so that the local housing authority can inform local inuit workers of this employment opportunity ?
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation , mr. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
i didn &apos;t quite hear the member &apos;s question . i would like to ask him to repeat the question for me . i &apos;m sorry , mr. speaker .
thank you very much .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
member for gjoa haven , mr. akoak , please repeat your question .
mr. akoak : thank you , mr. speaker . i &apos;ll try again .
i was pleased to note that the tender documents indicate that the prescribed minimum level of inuit labour as a percentage of total labour by dollar value for this construction will be 25 percent .
has gjoa haven &apos;s local housing association been made aware of this requirement so that the local housing authority can inform local inuit workers of this employment opportunity ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation , mr. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker . i also thank the member for repe@@ ating his question .
mr. speaker , when we &apos;re going to be constructing units in the community , we work with the local housing authorities . the ( interpretation ends ) district office ( interpretation ) or the local housing authorities work with the contractors to make sure that they hire local lab@@ our@@ ers or registered apprentices .
the contractor is made aware of the requirements for construction in the communities .
i believe that this is done and the lh@@ a in your community is kept well informed about this issue .
thank you very much , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. akoak .
mr. akoak : thank you , mr. speaker . the nunavut housing corporation &apos;s tender package for the construction of 20 new public housing units in gjoa haven also indicates that &quot; an amount of up to $ 50,000 will be made available to the contractor to fund training of inuit workers &quot; in trades and other discipl@@ ines .
that is good news .
has gjoa haven &apos;s local housing association been made aware of this requirement so that the lh@@ a can inform local inuit workers of this training opportunity ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation , mr. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
as per my earlier comments , i spoke to this need for good communication lines between the corporation and the local organizations whenever any work will be commenced on our units .
i &apos;m referring to the nhc contracts . whenever a contract will be let , we need to ensure that there is ( interpretation ends ) local employment ( interpretation ) and what i referenced before , which are training opportunities . this would include on @-@ the @-@ job training , if the worker wishes to become an ( interpretation ends ) apprenti@@ ce ( interpretation ) or if they are already an apprenti@@ ce .
the funding referred to by the member would be to assist communities . this $ 50,000 is for training and to ensure that the contractor can train local workers . this is well known by the lhos , as we have provided information announcing this previously on how to apply for the funding and the purpose as well .

question 7@@ 71 - 4 ( 3 ) : status of office of patient relations ( mikkungwak )
mr. mikkungwak ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of health .
mr. speaker , one of my constituents was asking me questions and my constituents have asked me questions about problems or concerns they have with respect to their health care .
i am certain that every one of my colleagues , including myself , know that there is an office , the office of patient relations , to which we can direct our constituents for information and assistance .
even though this office has been in existence for some time , constituents often seem un@@ aware that it exists and still come to ask me for help .
can the minister provide an update on what efforts are being made to ensure that all nunavut residents are aware of the role of the office of patient relations and how to contact the office if they need help ?
thank you very much , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of health , mr. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate the member bringing this issue forward . it gives me an opportunity to talk about the good work that the office of patient relations has done and continues to do .
the member is right . the office of patient relations was announced in july of 2013 and has been stead@@ ily growing .
the ability to deal with issues has streamlin@@ ed a lot of the processes to get information to nunavummiut .
i do realize we could do a better job promoting the office of patient relations and it is something i have had discussions with the department on looking at like an advertising campaign or something like that .
there are several ways to file a concern .
i always recommend people , if they feel comfortable , to talk directly to the health care provider if they have an issue or a concern , or that person &apos;s manager or supervisor .
if they &apos;re not comfortable with that , obviously you can contact the office of patient relations any time .
like i said , there are a number of different ways :
in @-@ person ;
there &apos;s a toll @-@ free number , 8@@ 55 @-@ 4@@ 38@@ - 3@@ 003 ;
there is email , pati@@ en@@ t@@ relations @ go@@ v@@ .nu.ca ;
by completing the standardized form on the nunavut health website ; or
by letter by ma@@ iling the territorial manager of patient relations at the office of patient relations , department of health , box 1000 , station 1000 , iqaluit , nunavut , x0a 0h0 .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
the office of patient relations can play a very important role in resolving mis@@ understand@@ ings , correc@@ ting mis@@ communications , and assisting nunavut residents in getting the health care they or their family members need but which , for one reason or another , they haven &apos;t been able to receive .
can the minister clearly describe how the various different activities of the office of patient relations are recorded , monitored , and evaluated for success ?
thank you very much , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of health , mr. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
all issues that are brought forward to patient relations aren &apos;t necessarily negative .
a lot of times it &apos;s there to just help clarify , like the member said , a question or a process .
they &apos;re very good advoc@@ ates to make sure that nunavummiut are receiving the health care that they expect . they also work with health care professionals to medi@@ ate any challenges that do arise .
issues are tra@@ cked and followed up with the patient or with the health care professional as needs are determined .
numbers are tra@@ cked by community . in 2015 there were approximately 238 concerns brought to the office of patient relations and that number has gone down to , i believe , 214 last fiscal year .
the number is quite close , but it just goes to show that people are aware of the office and do appreciate the work that &apos;s being done out of there .
i hope that answers the member &apos;s question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak : mr. speaker , in many jurisdictions , o@@ mb@@ u@@ d@@ sman offices or advocacy offices often have a mandate to support and protect the rights of specific groups , such as youth or the elderly or housing tenants , for example .
can the minister confirm whether or not the office of patient relations has a mandate to support and protect the rights of medical patients and other clients of nunavut &apos;s health care system ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of health , hon. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
i really do appreciate the member helping bring focus to this office and the good work that they do .
when we &apos;re talking about advoc@@ ating for patients , just some of the roles that are under the office of patient relations mandate is , like i said , to help those with questions or suggestions related to concerns about health care and services provided ; to assist patients and families to naviga@@ te the health care system itself .
it is also there to provide advice on conflict resolutions for patients , their families , and hospital or health centre personnel .
also like i stated earlier , it investiga@@ tes patient concerns and does provide follow @-@ up with the patient .
it also makes recommendations to improve the patient care following an investigation or concern so that we can continuously improve the services that we &apos;re providing to nunavummiut .
i think , when you &apos;re talking about a third party or an arm &apos;s @-@ length organization over@@ seeing , the office of patient relations does have a function there where we have a concern resolution committee .
if people aren &apos;t satisfied with the response that &apos;s provided through patient relations , it can get escal@@ ated to the regional executive director or even up to the assistant deputy minister .
like i said , the concern resolution committee , any escal@@ ated or very complicated cases can be examined by this committee , who looks at it from a ne@@ ut@@ ral perspective .
as of yet , just to show the good work that the office has been doing , that committee has , to my knowledge , never had to meet .
in answering the member &apos;s question , there is that oversight that &apos;s available to the office of patient relations and to nunavut health care patients .

mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker . i thank mr. enook for extending question period so that some others can get questions in .
my questions are for the premier and they concern his minister &apos;s statement from yesterday regarding the federal nutrition north canada program .
in his statement yesterday the premier indicated that he has met and been ex@@ changing correspondence with the federal minister of indigenous and northern affairs on this issue .
he also stated that the government of nunavut has made some specific recommendations to the federal government concerning how to fix or replace the nutrition north program .
mr. speaker , the nutrition north program is important to all nunavut communities . i ask : will the premier commit to tabling his recent exchange of correspondence in the house before the end of the current spring sitting ?
thank you , mr. speaker .

hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate the question from the member of sanikiluaq . first of all i want to thank his community members , the mayor and council .
we visited there with ministers hickes , peterson , and mike and we were welcomed from the people of sanikiluaq . we got treated like royal@@ ty , so we really appreciate that . again , we met with the hamlet council , the respective ministers to their respective offices and the people who work for their respective departments .
we really appreciate that and i thank you for that invitation .
mr. speaker , the nutrition north program is really critical to nunavummiut . as you know , around 60 percent of our residents of nunavut have food in@@ security . it was also stated in the conference board of canada .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s really critical to nunavummiut . that program was developed for northern communities such as all the territory of nunavut .
i believe there &apos;s only one community in the yukon that has access to this program .
mr. speaker , i have no problem tabling the letter to the house here .

the hon. premier of nunavut , mr. peter taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
i did make a hand@@ ful of recommendations to the minister of inac and of course it &apos;s six pages long .
if i read that , we will use up all the time for question period .
&gt; &gt; laughter
for example , there are reports out there from the auditor general &apos;s office that indicate that the system is not working .
we used some of those recommendations that the auditor general made public , including our own .
we do have to ensure that we find ways to assist the inac department in making sure that public money is used for public good and it &apos;s transparent .
at this point we don &apos;t know the amount of the savings passed on to the consumer .
if you don &apos;t know the landed cost , the freight costs , and the profit mar@@ gin , you don &apos;t know if the program is actually assisting nunavummiut .
that is one of the recommendations that i have made to ensure that the savings are passed on to the people in need as this program has been developed to assist nunavummiut .
at this point we just don &apos;t know if it &apos;s doing that .

while reviewing the hansard of the northwest territories , i noticed that on may 31 of 2017 the premier of the northwest territories stated in his legislative assembly that the government of the northwest territories has , and i quote , &quot; offered to take over the program if the accomp@@ an@@ ying money would be transferred with it . &quot;
has our premier made the same request to ottawa about taking over the delivery of this program in nunavut ?

hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
i haven &apos;t made that specific request , but you know , mr. speaker , there are many programs that we run and we &apos;re in a different situation than the northwest territories .

question 7@@ 73 - 4 ( 3 ) : number of children allowed by policy assigned to foster parents ( enook )
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question today to the minister of family services .
mr. speaker , people in nunavut are very grateful that there are many foster parents in the different communities .
unfortunately far too many of our youth need a safe place to go when family situations deterior@@ ate .
we are thankful that foster parents can provide a temporary safe haven . however , at times it seems as though some foster homes take in more foster children than they would reason@@ ably be expected to .
maybe it &apos;s because they &apos;re the only ones available .
can the minister clearly indicate what policies are in place with respect to the number of children that can be accommo@@ dated within a foster family and how his department ensures that the policies are followed ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of family services , mr. johnny mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank my colleague for asking that question .
i can &apos;t give you a number right now .
i would have to check into it first to see how many wards are allowed to be in each foster home . i will have to get the information and get back to the member .
unfortunately i can &apos;t answer that right now , mr. chairman .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
raising children is a challenge . it &apos;s not just raising kids .
parents must ensure that the home is safe and comfortable , that there is enough food to eat , and that the children are treated respec@@ t@@ fully and suppor@@ tively .
these challenges are also faced by foster parents .
can the minister clearly describe what measures are in place to provide oversight of foster home conditions to ensure that foster children receive the appropriate levels of care and support ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of family services , mr. johnny mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , family services is always looking for new foster parents .
foster parents that take very good care of children are usually the ones that are chosen . many of those who are eligible to be foster parents take part in hunting activities . the foster parents are encouraged to make sure that the children go to school .
that &apos;s the way things are done . when it is necessary for children to go to foster parents , we try to put them in a cal@@ mer environment that is suitable .
that is what the department of family services tries to do for them , and we are always looking for new foster parents that can take very good care of children .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i know that the overwhel@@ ming majority of foster parents provide the best of care and support to the children they take into their homes .
unfortunately it has been brought to my attention that a few foster parents provide this service primarily as a means to earn extra income .
the concern has been raised that the foster children in their care are not treated well and it is just as a means to earn money .
can the minister clarify whether he is aware of such situations and , if so , can he explain how his department deals with them ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of family services , mr. johnny mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
foster parents are selected if a child needs care and has to be moved to a foster home .
the first priority for family services is the immediate family of the foster child so that they can have a better place to be .
i can consider this matter further , either through requesting a briefing or in getting information provided to me .
since my colleague has provided this information about some foster parents only applying in order to der@@ ive income from foster children or the possibility of that occurring , i will need to carefully research this issue to see if that has occurred in the past .
i will also check into the process , as prospe@@ ctive foster parents should be ve@@ tted and it relates to their capacity to perform as adequate foster parents that handle the required responsibilities .
yes , i can consider that matter to see if some foster parents &quot; mo@@ tives include wanting to der@@ ive income from foster children .
yes , i can commit to informing the house if that happened to be the case .

question 7@@ 74 - 4 ( 3 ) : accountability for public funds ( angnakak )
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of family services .
mr. speaker , the mandate of the department of family services is , in part , to provide a range of support services for children and vulnerable adults who may require protection or other specialized support .
in many cases funding is actually provided through contracts , grants , or contributions to other parties to provide services on the government &apos;s behalf .
can the minister clearly explain how his department ensures that services provided with government funds are delivered in an appropriate and accountable manner ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of family services , hon. johnny mike .
hon. johnny mike : thank you , mr. speaker .
when we talk about contracts or contributions , we &apos;re dealing with public money , public funds , and we do our best to monitor all the contribution agreements and contracts that go to services .
( interpretation ) as i stated , the service providers must be monitored and taken care of properly to make sure they follow the conditions for using government funding .
the department of family services tries to use that properly with the ones that we have funding agreements with and we try to work well with other parties for those reasons , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary . ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
from time to time , constituents bring forward concerns related to the staffing , policies , or services at facilities which are operated under a contract or through a grant or contribution from the government .
can the minister clearly describe what steps are taken to follow up and address complaints and concerns about entities which provide support for vulnerable nunavummiut with funds allocated through his department ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of family services , mr. johnny mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
concerns may arise related to any of the services funded through the department of family services . when a concern is submitted , it would result in an investigation through the department of family services .
the investigation would determine what trans@@ pi@@ red and whether any concerns cro@@ pped up .
in particular , if considering investigations , it would include the department of finance and the department of justice . we partner with these departments when conducting investigations and collaborate on specific cases as required .
further , the agreement for this service has several requirements which we try to follow , such as the agreed @-@ to services provided , which all have mon@@ etary values that are the basis for the agreement .
this forms the agreement with the various areas listed that will be covered .
yes , the department of family services can indeed review this issue or any other issue whenever a concern ris@@ es . this can include the return of the child or submitting recommendations to dis@@ solve their foster parent status or deal with them in conjunction with the departments of justice or finance .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
that makes me think of a lot of questions i would like to ask to that response , but i &apos;ll keep to s@@ cri@@ pt here .
mr. speaker , it is very concerning to hear complaints or allegations about entities which provide services to vulnerable nunavummiut .
will the minister commit to ensuring that any entity which receives money from his department either through contract , grant , or contribution is made aware of its duty to provide adequate and appropriate services and be held completely accountable ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of family services , mr. mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
as a government and as the department of family services , our responsibility includes these funding agreements for provision of services .
now , if we require an investigation of any kind related to funding ir@@ regul@@ ari@@ ties , the agreements speak to the ethi@@ cal usage of these funds . because we require these services , whenever a question of impro@@ pri@@ ety arises , whether it is at a shelter , group , or elders facilities that we fund , if the managers are not providing the service which has been agreed to , then it would result in the penalties listed in the agreement due to its importance .
yes , any agreement we have includes provisions related to impro@@ pri@@ ety and investigations . any organization we have an agreement with requiring an investigation still has rights to be informed and to present a coun@@ ter argument to the expressed concern about funding issues . as well , we have to inform the clients receiving the service .
that is how it is structured .
if there &apos;s an agreement in place , the nunavut government and the department of family services have to follow the conditions of the agreement if they are agreed to and signed by the organization or the public .

mr. alexander sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister responsible for nunavut arctic college .
mr. speaker , the minister will recall that in february of this year , i asked when the carpentry program would be delivered at the rankin inlet trade school campus .
can the minister provide an update on the current status of the nunavut arctic college carpentry program ?

it will go ahead in the next new school year and that &apos;s when it will be provided .

hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
there are different programs that can be delivered at the trade school , not just for carpentry . there are heavy equipment operator courses and government management studies .
there are different trades courses that can be delivered at the rankin inlet campus and they have been successfully carried out . there will be some graduates from that school this year and i am proud of that .
the rankin inlet trade school is for trades training .
the various programs will have instructors and the programs that are required will proceed in the new school year .
as i stated earlier , the instructors will be moving from here . the programs that were available in iqaluit will be moved to rankin inlet and i expect that to proceed smoothly .
we plan a year ahead for what programs will be made available and we know one year in advance who the instructors will be for what programs .
those are already set .
i only expect this program to start successfully at the rankin inlet trade school .

question 7@@ 76 - 4 ( 3 ) : funding for community arena upgrades ( qirngnuq )
mr. qirngnuq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my questions to the minister of community and government services .
as the minister will recall , on february 29 , 2016 he and his federal counterparts jointly announced that more than $ 19 million in federal and territorial funding would be made available for &quot; upgrading community arenas &quot; in nunavut under the federal small communities fund .
during our recent winter sitting , my colleague , the member of aivilik , asked a number of questions concerning this funding .
in his response the minister indicated that his department was conducting an assessment of community arenas at that time to determine which arenas would be upgraded .
can the minister update the house today on the status of that assessment ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
the arenas are being evaluated and it &apos;s still about the same . we &apos;re going to spend the money where we can extend the season the most and where we can get the most out of our money .

committee report 029 - 4 ( 3 ) : report on the review of the information and privacy commissioner &apos;s 2016 report on the privacy audit of the qikiqtani general hospital ( angnakak )
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to present the report of the standing committee on public accounts , independent officers and other entities on its review of the information and privacy commissioner &apos;s 2016 report on her privacy audit of the qikiqtani general hospital .
the access to information and protection of privacy act and regulations were inherited from the northwest territories on april 1 , 1999 and it provides the commissioner of nunavut to appoint , on the recommendation of the legislative assembly , the information and privacy commissioner for a five @-@ year term of office .
ms. el@@ a@@ ine keen@@ an ben@@ g@@ ts was re@@ appointed on february 24 , 2015 for a five @-@ year term of office as nunavut &apos;s information and privacy commissioner .
she is currently serving her fourth term as information and privacy commissioner of nunavut . ms. keen@@ an ben@@ g@@ ts also serves as the information and privacy commissioner of the northwest territories .
between 1999 and 2012 a number of minor amendments to the legislation were made to address confli@@ cts with other territorial statutes .
mr. speaker , the legislative assembly passed bill 38 , an act to amend the access to information and protection of privacy act , on june 8 , 2012 .
the amendments made under bill 38 provided clear authority for the information and privacy commissioner to undertake privacy @-@ related reviews concerning personal information held by public bodies .
these amendments came into force on may 11 , 2013 .
in its report on the review of the information and privacy commissioner &apos;s 2012 @-@ 13 and 2013 @-@ 14 annual reports , which were presented to the legislative assembly on october 28 , 2014 , the standing committee recommended that &quot; the government of nunavut co@@ operate with the office of the information and privacy commissioner in undertaking at least one formal privacy audit of a department , crown agency or territorial corporation . &quot;
the information and privacy commissioner &apos;s report on the privacy audit of qikiqtani general was tabled in the house on november 8 , 2016 .
mr. speaker , the standing committee received the government &apos;s formal response to the information and privacy commissioner &apos;s report on may 3 , 2017 .
for the benefit of the vie@@ wing public , the government &apos;s formal response has been included as an appendix to the report that i am presenting today .
the information and privacy commissioner , along with her colleague mr. robert gary di@@ ck@@ son , appeared before the standing committee to answer questions regarding the office &apos;s report and privacy audit on may 10 to 11 , 2017 .
government officials from the department of health and the department of executive and intergovernmental affairs also appeared before the standing committee at that time .
the standing committee &apos;s hearings were televised live across the territory and were open to the public and news media to observe from the visitors &quot; gallery .
transcri@@ pts from the standing committee &apos;s hearings will be made available on the legislative assembly &apos;s website .
a number of themes and issues emerg@@ ed during the standing committee &apos;s review of the information and privacy commissioner &apos;s report on her first privacy audit of a government department .
as indicated in her report , the information and privacy commissioner &apos;s audit of the qikiqtani general hospital consist@@ ed of a thorough review of the government &apos;s policies and directives relating to privacy and protection of information , a number of interviews with government officials responsible for over@@ seeing and implementing privacy initiatives within the hospital , and a site visit to the hospital .
the standing committee appreci@@ ates the level of detail provided in the information and privacy commissioner &apos;s report and supports each of the recommendations that were included .
the standing committee is concerned that the findings of the audit highlight a significant need for increased and more coordinated efforts within the hospital to effectively protect the privacy of patients &quot; personal health information .
the standing committee notes that the government has made a number of efforts to address this need , including providing atipp training to hospital staff , developing some health @-@ specific privacy directives , and amending its procedures within the hospital to ensure the physical security of personal health information .
however , the standing committee is of the view that the department must provide more comprehensive and privacy @-@ specific policies and training for hospital staff in order for it to meet its obligations under the access to information and protection of privacy act and provide adequate safe@@ guards for the protection of the personal information that it colle@@ cts , uses , and dis@@ closes .
mr. speaker , while the standing committee recognizes that the scope of the information and privacy commissioner &apos;s audit focused on the practices of the qikiqtani general hospital , the standing committee is of the view that the findings of that audit reflect a number of challenges that are also currently being experienced by community health centres across the territory .
accordingly the standing committee makes the following recommendations :
that the government develop a su@@ ite of policies that establish mandatory requirements and responsibilities for the protection of personal health information that is collected , used , or dis@@ closed by the hospital , community health centres , and all other health service providers in the territory .
that the government develop a comprehensive and privacy @-@ specific training program for hospital and community health staff .
that the government clearly assi@@ gn the role and responsibilities of a privacy officer to a specific individual or a small number of individuals within the hospital until such a time as a privacy officer position can be filled .
in closing , mr. speaker , the standing committee commen@@ ds the information and privacy commissioner for her hard work in conducting this audit and looks forward to reading future reports on her office &apos;s future audits .
mr. speaker , i would note for the record that the standing committee is requesting that the government provide a comprehensive response to this report , pursuant to rule 91 ( 5 ) of the rules of the legislative assembly of nunavut .
with that , i move that the report of the standing committee be received by the house and entered into the record as read .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the member has moved that the report be received and entered into the record as read by the house .

mr. speaker , the number of correspondence that goes out of my office on a week@@ ly basis is quite exc@@ es@@ sive , and i should have rememb@@ ered at the time that i did respond to the member &apos;s question that she accus@@ ed me today of not responding to back on november 18 , 2016 .
there were some comments or sounds made after the question was raised that i did not respond to the question .
i know all members here are very aware and cogni@@ z@@ ant of how i deal with their requests for information , that i take them all very seriously .
basically i just don &apos;t appreciate the accus@@ ation that i didn &apos;t respond when it was very clear that i did respond to the member .
i would appreciate an apology .

ms. angnakak , to the point of order .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i wasn &apos;t really satisfied with this response because it didn &apos;t really answer all of the questions that i had .
it left out contract details that i wanted and i feel that it &apos;s really important to nunavummiut that they have that kind of information of how public dollars are being spent .
you talked a little bit about the os@@ h@@ ni case , but it didn &apos;t go into some of the questions that i was asking .
i thought it was important today to raise that again , that it &apos;s about contracts . i think it &apos;s really important that nunavummiut know how their money is being spent .
i am sorry .
i will apologize if i came across as ru@@ de or dis@@ respectful .
i apologize to the member , but at the same time i think it &apos;s really important that we get the answers that we &apos;re looking for , that we don &apos;t get half answers ; we get all of these answers that we are looking for . i think that &apos;s where i was coming from .

the objective of this legislation is to harmoni@@ ze the procedures and administration for elections to municipal councils and district education authorities under the authority of the nunavut elections act .
to the greatest extent possible , all elections for the municipal councils , district education authorities , and the legislative assembly itself will be conducted under the same set of rules and elections results for its institutions will be publicly posted on election nunavut &apos;s website .
the chief electoral officer will have overall responsibility for the conduct of local elections and his annual reports to the legislative assembly will account to the members of this house for elections nunavut &apos;s work in this area .
as members will recall , the first bill passed by the current legislative assembly introduced fixed election dates for territorial elections . the next general election will be held in october of this year .
bill 49 provides that all elections for the municipal councils and district education authorities will be held on the fourth monday of october . office @-@ holders will have a standard four @-@ year term .
as members will recognize , a transi@@ tional period is required to implement this legislation .
the transi@@ tional rules begin on october 1 , 2018 and all new rules begin on april 1 , 2019 .
consequ@@ ently there will be no elections for municipal councils in october , november , or december of 2018 .
all municipal councillors who hold office on october 1 , 2018 will have their terms automatically extended or shor@@ tened , depending on when their term ends , to noon on october 29 , 2019 , the date on which elections to municipal councils and district education authorities will be held across the territory in all communities .

introduction
the access to information and protection of privacy act provides for the commissioner of nunavut to appoint , on the recommendation of the legislative assembly , the information and privacy commissioner for a five @-@ year term of office .
ms. el@@ a@@ ine keen@@ an ben@@ g@@ ts was re@@ appointed on february 24 , 2015 , for a 5 @-@ year term of office as nunavut &apos;s information and privacy commissioner .
this is her fourth term as information and privacy commissioner of nunavut .
ms. keen@@ an ben@@ g@@ ts also serves as the information and privacy commissioner of the northwest territories .
the access to information and protection of privacy act and regulations made under the act were inherited from the northwest territories on april 1 , 1999 .
between 1999 and 2012 , a number of minor amendments to the legislation were made to address confli@@ cts with other territorial statutes .
bill 38 , an act to amend the access to information and protection of privacy act , received 1st reading on june 1 , 2012 .
bill 38 received assent on june 8 , 2012 .
these amendments provided clear authority for the information and privacy commissioner to undertake privacy @-@ related reviews concerning personal information held by public bodies .
the amendments came into force on may 11 , 2013 .
in its report on the review of the 2012 @-@ 2013 and 2013 @-@ 2014 annual reports of the information and privacy commissioner , which was presented to the legislative assembly on october 28 , 2014 , the standing committee recommended that &quot; the government of nunavut co @-@ operate with the office of the information and privacy commissioner in undertaking at least one formal privacy audit of a department , crown agency or territorial corporation during the 2015 @-@ 2016 fiscal year . &quot;
the information and privacy commissioner &apos;s report on the privacy audit of the qikiqtani general was tabled in the house on november 8 , 2016 .
the standing committee received a copy of the government &apos;s formal response to the information and privacy commissioner &apos;s report on may 3 , 2017 , entitled department of health responses to ip@@ c q@@ gh privacy audit recommendations ( appendix a ) .
the may 10 @-@ 11 , 2017 , appear@@ ances of the information and privacy commissioner and government of nunavut officials before the standing committee took place in the chamber of the legislative assembly .
the standing committee &apos;s hearings were televised live across the territory and were open to the public and news media to observe from the visitors &quot; gallery .
transcri@@ pts from the standing committee &apos;s hearings will be available on the legislative assembly &apos;s website .
observations and recommendations
issue : legislation and policy
in her 2016 report on the privacy audit of the qikiqtani general hospital , the information and privacy commissioner recommends that the government of nunavut develop health @-@ specific privacy legislation .
the information and privacy commissioner has been advoc@@ ating for the development of this legislation for over a decade .
in its may 3 , 2017 , formal response to the recommendations of the information and privacy commissioner , the government stated that :
&quot; health is leading a committee with representation from across the department and justice ; the committee is developing a legislative proposal ( l@@ p ) as well as developing a list of privacy related activities that can be undertaken in the absence of legislation .
it is anticipated that the legislative proposal will be submitted at the beginning of the next government . &quot;
the standing committee continues to encourage the department to work closely with the information and privacy commissioner on the development of health @-@ specific privacy legislation .
the standing committee is aware that it may be a number of years before health @-@ specific privacy legislation is passed and brought into force in nunavut .
in the meantime , there are a number of outstanding issues concerning the protection of patients &quot; privacy that the standing committee believes need to be addressed as soon as possible .
section 42 of the access to information and protection of privacy act mandates that :
42 .
the head of a public body shall protect personal information by making reasonable security arrangements against such risks as un@@ authorized access , collection , use , disclosure or disposal .
in her report , the information and privacy commissioner descri@@ bes various types of security arrangements and safe@@ guards that can be implemented to achieve that goal .
she states that :
&quot; safe@@ guards against brea@@ ches of privacy might be catego@@ ri@@ zed as so@@ ft or hard .
&apos;@@ so@@ ft &apos; safe@@ guards are things like requiring employees to provide a privacy ple@@ dge or o@@ ath , providing ro@@ bu@@ st training , providing staff with a comprehensive set of policies and procedures for privacy protection . &quot;
unfortunately , in her report , the information and privacy commissioner also states that :
&quot; what the audit further reve@@ aled is that there is no privacy management program which is up @-@ to @-@ date , comprehensive and widely understood and supported .
without such a privacy management program , the efforts we did find to promote privacy awareness and compliance tend to be fr@@ ag@@ men@@ ted , in@@ consistent , and not well understood by all staff at q@@ gh . &quot;
in her report , the information and privacy commissioner indicates that , during the course of her site visit to the qikiqtani general hospital , she wit@@ n@@ essed several cases where personal health information was being impro@@ per@@ ly collected and re@@ tained on the pre@@ mis@@ es .
during the standing committee &apos;s may 10 @-@ 11 , 2017 , televised hearing , government officials indicated that a number of procedures that are intended to ensure that personal health information is secured and protected are now being implemented .
some of these procedures include ti@@ med scre@@ en@@ sav@@ ers for the hospital &apos;s computers , newly secured offices with limited and electronic access , and the transfer of patient files from paper to electronic format .
the standing committee commen@@ ds the hospital for its efforts .
however , the standing committee is it is of the view that the hospital must develop and implement clear and comprehensive policies to ensure that all staff are adher@@ ing to those procedures and protecting patients &quot; personal health information to the greatest extent possible .
the standing committee is aware that the government has implemented a number of policies concerning access to information and privacy , and has produced a comprehensive privacy management manual , which may be accessed and used a resource by all government employees , including hospital staff .
in its introduction , this manual reads :
&quot; the privacy management manual ( p@@ m@@ m ) is a comprehensive set of tools and resources to be used by all employees of the government of nunavut to successfully implement the privacy provisions of the access to information and protection of privacy ( atipp ) act . all employees are required to famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with the p@@ m@@ m as the atipp act holds each employee accountable for the privacy of personal information under the custody and control of the government . &quot;
however , in her report , the information and privacy commissioner stated that her office &apos;s audit &quot; reve@@ aled very little famili@@ ar@@ ity with the manual within q@@ gh . &quot;
she also stated that :
&quot; despite the statement in section 8 of the man@@ u@@ al@@ . that the document is designed to &quot; assist the atipp manager and atipp coordinators in their efforts to prevent privacy incidents and privacy brea@@ ches by identifying existing gaps and weak@@ nesses in the systems , policies and practices of public bodies , &quot; we found no evidence that either privacy inspections or privacy compliance audits have been done in q@@ gh prior to this audit . &quot;
during the standing committee &apos;s may 10 @-@ 11 , 2017 , televised hearing , government officials did not provide much information on what , if any , privacy @-@ specific policies and procedures are currently in place at the hospital .
government officials did provide some information on seven specific directives related to electronic health information , but these directives were , according to the information and privacy commissioner , out @-@ of @-@ date and had not been implemented at the time of her audit .
during the standing committee &apos;s may 10 @-@ 11 , 2017 , televised hearing , government officials testi@@ fied that :
&quot; the question was for a list of the privacy .... i &apos;m not sure on the exact wording , but the directives and the policies and so on .
all of them are actually located in the report of the privacy commissioner .
she had already included them in the appendix .
the only thing that i would have to add to that is the privacy and security directives that guide employees , contractors and agents of the government of nunavut on matters concerning the management of e @-@ health systems , including the i@@ e@@ hr system and there are seven directives and i &apos;ll read them into the record . the seven directives include monitoring and audit of e @-@ health systems , e @-@ health information security , retention and disposal of electronic personal information , e @-@ health information privacy and pass@@ word management for e @-@ health systems , collection use and disclosure of personal information in e @-@ health systems and finally e @-@ health access control .
these are the directives that are being translated and will be tabled . &quot;
the standing committee is concerned that the department appears to only have prepared policies for personal health information that is collected , used and dis@@ closed through its &quot; e @-@ health systems , &quot; despite the fact that the hospital and community health centres are all operating on a hy@@ bri@@ d system where personal health information is currently being re@@ tained in both paper and electronic for@@ ma@@ ts .
while the standing committee recognizes that the department of health has made efforts to develop directives , policies and other materials to inform its employees of privacy best practices and expectations , these efforts need more coordination and monitoring .
standing committee recommendation # 1
the standing committee recommends that the government of nunavut provide , in its response to this report , a list of all formal policies that it currently has in place at the qikiqtani general hospital concerning the protection of privacy or access to information .
the standing committee further recommends that the government of nunavut develop a su@@ ite of policies that establish mandatory requirements and responsibilities for the protection of personal health information that is collected , used or dis@@ closed by the hospital , community health centres , and all other health service providers in the territory .
the standing committee further recommends that the government of nunavut , in its work to develop privacy @-@ specific policies for the hospital and community health centres , ensure that the following areas are addressed :
a definition of personal health information ;
a limited list of persons who may receive access to personal health information ; training that will be required of persons who are provided with access to personal health information ;
o@@ a@@ ths of confidentiality or standards of conduct that must be acknowledged and agreed to by persons who may receive access to personal health information ; a list of persons responsible for implementing privacy protection measures any and all guiding principles that must be acknowledged and agreed to by such persons ;
a list of the circumstances under which personal health information maybe accessed ;
established procedures and processes that may be used to retain or destro@@ y personal health information ;
specific measures that will be taken to monitor the implementation of legislation and policies concerning privacy protection ;
limits on the manner and scope that personal health information may be collected ;
limits on the use , disclosure and retention of personal health information ;
a list of security safe@@ guards that must be in place at each facility ;
an established process by which a person may access their information ;
established procedures or processes by which health care service providers or the department must inform patients of their right to access their own personal health information ;
an established process by which a person can submit complaints and in@@ qu@@ iri@@ es regarding their request to access their information ;
established procedures and processes for addressing privacy incident and brea@@ ches specific to the hospital and community health centres ;
established procedures or processes by which the hospital or community health centres will conduct privacy impact assessments ; and
established rules for the agreements under which a health service provider may share personal health information , including the responsibilities of any third party service providers who receive access to personal health information under such agreements .
the standing committee further recommends that the government of nunavut provide , in its response to this report , a detailed timeline by which it plans to have completed a su@@ ite of comprehensive policies for the protection of personal health information .
the standing committee further recommends that the government of nunavut makes all policies related to the protection of personal health information available to the public as early as practi@@ cable .
issue : training
in order to implement or administer any privacy @-@ related legislation or policy , the department of health ultimately re@@ lies on each individual employee in the hospital to understand and comply with appropriate practices and procedures concerning the collection , use and disclosure of personal health information .
in her report , the information and privacy commissioner raises concerns that the department is not providing hospital staff with sufficient information or training on privacy best practices .
in her report , the information and privacy commissioner stated that :
&quot; we found that there is no comprehensive privacy training program for new hires nor in @-@ service training on privacy best practices . &quot;
in her report , the information and privacy commissioner recommended that :
&quot; there should be comprehensive comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y privacy training with appropriate privacy training materials for all q@@ gh staff .
this should include training on the med@@ ite@@ ch system . &quot;
in its may 3 , 2017 , formal response to the information and privacy commissioner &apos;s report , the government did not clearly indicate if it agrees that comprehensive and privacy @-@ specific training should be comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y for all hospital staff .
instead , in response to this specific recommendation , the government only makes reference to &quot; training on the med@@ ite@@ ch system . &quot;
during the standing committee &apos;s may 10 @-@ 11 , 2017 , televised hearing , government officials did provide some information on the training that it is currently provided to hospital staff to inform them of privacy best practices and of their obligations under the access to information and protection of privacy act .
during the standing committee &apos;s televised hearing , the following exchange took place :
&quot; mr. rumbolt : thank you , madam chairperson .
one final question .
on page 41 of the report , the information and privacy commissioner states that she found sta@@ cks of patient files sitting on un@@ attended des@@ ks during the course of her audit .
what types of training does your department provide to hospital staff to inform them of privacy best practices ?
thank you , madam chairperson .
chairperson : thank you , mr. rumbolt .
ms. stock@@ ley .
ms. stock@@ ley : thank you , madam chairperson . again , it &apos;s an on @-@ the @-@ job type of training that is provided on orientation with periodi@@ c updates through directives coming from the department , new@@ s@@ letters , and updates shared with staff .
thank you , madam chairperson . &quot;
during the standing committee &apos;s may 10 @-@ 11 , 2017 , televised hearing , government officials also testi@@ fied that :
&quot; health provides periodi@@ c communications to its staff such as atipp coordinator guides on topics such as proper en@@ cr@@ y@@ ption of confidential information , sending and receiving electronic and physical mail , and how to properly save files to protected dri@@ ves .
information related to privacy protection is also dis@@ semin@@ ated though interdepartmental new@@ s@@ letters .
staff training opportunities around records management and atipp training are available and provided by the government of nunavut , as well as through presentations offered to community health staff groups during meetings and conferences . &quot;
during the standing committee &apos;s may 10 @-@ 11 , 2017 televised hearing , government officials also testi@@ fied that :
&quot; we do regular cir@@ cul@@ ation of privacy directives for staff and the expectation is that they will inform their patients , their clients .
we do consistent training and presentations for all staff .
we do standard orientation presentations for new frontline health care providers , and we do information dis@@ semin@@ ation through the two health internal new@@ s@@ letters called the pul@@ se and the connection that are distributed right throughout the territory to health care providers . &quot;
the standing committee is concerned that the training described by government officials is not sufficient to constitu@@ te comprehensive and privacy @-@ specific training , for a number of reasons .
first of all , there appears to be no expectation that all hospital staff should have privacy @-@ specific training . the official &apos;s testimony that the department does provide &quot; consistent training and presentations for all staff &quot; was not supplemen@@ ted by any clear description of what components are included in that training .
the official &apos;s testimony that &quot; standard orientation presentations &#91; are provided &#93; for new frontline health care providers &quot; does not explic@@ it@@ ly confirm that this &quot; orientation presentation &quot; includes clear and specific information related to privacy best practices .
secondly , if not all staff are required to take privacy @-@ specific training at this time , there still appears to be no clear policy , directive or guideline that speci@@ fies which hospital staff must have privacy @-@ specific training .
furthermore , in their testimony , government officials made no mention of any mechanism to track whether or not staff who are required to take privacy @-@ specific training do , in fact , take that training .
the standing committee recognizes that the department of health makes efforts to provide atipp training to hospital and community health centre staff .
however , in the same way that the access to information and protection of privacy act does not provide the necessary health @-@ specific legislative framework that the territory needs , the standing committee is of the view that the related atipp training does not provide the specific information that hospital and health centre staff need to know in order to protect the patients &quot; privacy to the greatest extent possible .
the standing committee is also concerned about the department &apos;s apparent reliance on the use of presentations and &quot; information dis@@ semin@@ ation &quot; in providing information and training on privacy best practices to hospital staff .
presentations do not measure the extent to which an individual is knowledgeable about a particular subject and while information dis@@ semin@@ ation , in forms such as new@@ s@@ letters , may be informa@@ tive , it is difficult to determine if the information dis@@ semin@@ ated is in fact being ab@@ sor@@ bed and used by the intended audience .
while the standing committee commen@@ ds the department of health for its efforts to inform and train hospital staff of privacy best practices , it agrees with the information and privacy commissioner that a comprehensive and privacy @-@ specific training program needs to be developed for all hospital and community health centre staff .
the standing committee is of the view that without comprehensive and privacy @-@ specific training for all staff , it will be very difficult for the hospital and community health centres to confi@@ dently assure their patients that they are equipped to protect personal health information .
standing committee recommendation # 2
the standing committee recommends that the government of nunavut develop a comprehensive training program for hospital and community health centre staff that includes , but is not limited to , the following components :
information and procedures related to the patient &apos;s right to access ;
information and procedures related to identifying and reporting privacy brea@@ ches and incidents ;
a specific list of individuals that staff may contact with concerns related to privacy protection in the hospital ;
implementing privacy best practices in the workplace , including ,
stor@@ ing , transferring and destro@@ ying paper and electronic files ,
use of email , fax , mobile and other electronic devices ,
having conversations in open spaces , and
sharing information with third parties ;
detailed training on all relevant policies , directives and procedures that may be in place at the facility at that time .
the standing committee recommends that the government of nunavut provide , in its response to this report , a detailed timeline by which it plans to complete this comprehensive training program .
the standing committee recommends that the government of nunavut make the above @-@ mentioned training program comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y for all employees who may have access to personal health information that is used , collected , or dis@@ closed by the government of nunavut .
the standing committee recommends that the government of nunavut implement a system to track and monitor all privacy @-@ specific training that is provided to staff , including any training related to the use of med@@ ite@@ ch .

the presence of privacy @-@ specific training programs and policies alone will not be sufficient to ensure that adequate safe@@ guards are in place to protect patients &quot; privacy .
these privacy training programs , policies and all other efforts will need to be focused , coordinated and monitored before privacy best practices are implemented at the hospital in a thorough and consistent manner .
in her report , the information and privacy commissioner recommended that the department appoint a privacy officer , who will have a designated leadership role in privacy compliance efforts within the hospital .
this privacy officer should also have the mandate to develop a comprehensive privacy management program , providing advice on privacy compliance to the regional and community health centres .
the information and privacy commissioner also recommended that this privacy officer be responsible for :
providing input on achieving good privacy compliance in new programs , new software and policies for the hospital and community health centres ;
developing a full su@@ ite of written policies and procedures for privacy compliance ;
over@@ seeing staff privacy training for all new hires , in @-@ service training for existing employees , as well as volunteers and contractors ;
ensuring that all out @-@ sour@@ cing contracts that involve significant volu@@ mes of personal health information include the necessary privacy prote@@ ctions ; and ,
ensuring that patients are made aware of their privacy rights .
the standing committee agrees with the information and privacy commissioner &apos;s recommendation and emphasi@@ ses that the department must make every effort to ensure that the above @-@ mentioned responsibilities are being ful@@ filled , even in the absence of a formal privacy officer .
during the standing committee &apos;s may 10 @-@ 11 , 2017 , televised hearing , government officials supplemen@@ ted that response and testi@@ fied that :
&quot; while we agree with that , we actually had a privacy officer position .
it went out for competition and was never successful in being filled .
i believe the first time it went out for competition was in 2011 .
instead of having nobody to do it , we now have two positions that share responsibilities for the job that one person would do in many other jurisdictions .
that is how we have tried to do what we could here in our territory . we have the responsibility for privacy divided between two positions .
one is a clinical advis@@ er and one is a quality assurance and risk management coordinator .
i &apos;m happy to say both of those positions are filled . &quot;
the standing committee recognizes that it may be a number of years yet before the department successfully f@@ ills a privacy officer position .
the standing committee encourages the department to identify a specific position or position ( s ) that will be responsible for providing that focus , coordination and monitoring until such a time as a privacy officer is appointed at the hospital .
standing committee recommendation # 3
the standing committee recommends that the government of nunavut provide , in its response to this report , a detailed timeline by which the department plans to open a privacy officer position for competition .
the standing committee recommends that the government of nunavut provide , in its response to this report , a detailed listing of the specific positions that will be responsible for each of the following tasks within the hospital and community health centres :
leading privacy compliance efforts ;
developing a comprehensive privacy management program ;
providing advice on privacy compliance to the regional and community health centres ; providing input on achieving good privacy compliance in new programs , new software and policies for the hospital and community health centres ;
developing a full su@@ ite of written policies and procedures for privacy compliance ;
over@@ seeing staff privacy training for all new hires , in @-@ service training for existing employees , as well as volunteers and contractors ;
ensuring that all out @-@ sour@@ cing contracts that involve significant volu@@ mes of personal health information include the necessary privacy prote@@ ctions ; and ,
ensuring that patients are made aware of their privacy rights .

department of health responses to ip@@ c q@@ gh privacy audit recommendations
ip@@ c recommendation # 1 :
that the q@@ gh and all other health facilities in nunavut be designated in the ati@@ ppa regulations as a &quot; public body . &quot;
health response : q@@ gh ( as all health centres ) is not a stand @-@ alone entity , but rather reports to the deputy minister of health through the assistant deputy minister , operations .
therefore , it is a public body under the oversight of the department of health and subject to the ati@@ ppa .
if the government of nunavut should , in the future , establish health authorities with separate governance authorities , this recommendation could be re@@ visited and applied to all health care facilities in the territory , as govern@@ ed by applicable legislation .
ip@@ c recommendation # 2 :
that the gn develop a stand @-@ alone health information law similar to such laws in other canadian jurisdictions .
health response : health is leading a committee with representation from across the department and justice ; the committee is developing a legislative proposal ( l@@ p ) as well as developing a list of privacy related activities that can be undertaken in the absence of legislation .
it is anticipated that the legislative proposal will be submitted at the beginning of the next government .
the committee is currently working to develop a culture of privacy within the department of health through the following activities :
regular cir@@ cul@@ ation of privacy directives for staff ;
consistent training and presentations for all staff ;
standard orientation presentations for new front @-@ line health care providers ; and
information dis@@ semin@@ ation through the pul@@ se and the connection ( health &apos;s internal new@@ s@@ letters ) .
ip@@ c recommendation # 3 :
focus should be on ensuring that the law is as straight @-@ forward and accessible as possible .
that should facilitate better understanding and ultimately higher levels of compliance at q@@ gh .
health response : a jurisdictional s@@ can was completed by the committee on specific privacy legislation with the aim of implementing legislation that is accessible and appropriate for nunavut .
ip@@ c recommendation # 4 :
that q@@ gh appoint a privacy officer with the following fe@@ atures :
designated leadership role to lead the privacy compliance efforts in q@@ gh ;
suf@@ fici@@ ently senior to be able to have ready access to the ceo and senior management ;
mandated to develop a comprehensive privacy management program ;
to provide input to the ceo and senior management on achieving good privacy compliance in new programs , new software and policies ;
to be responsible for developing a full su@@ ite of written policies and procedures for privacy compliance and to oversee staff privacy training both the orientation of new hires and in @-@ service training for existing employees as well as volunteers and contractors ;
to ensure proper privacy protection in out @-@ sour@@ cing contracts that involve significant volu@@ mes of personal health information ;
to be the key liaison between the q@@ gh and the office of the information and privacy commissioner ;
to be closely associated with the records department and the it department to ensure that privacy considerations are regularly and fully can@@ v@@ ass@@ ed by those departments in the course of their work ;
to consider how to ensure that information about patient &apos;s privacy rights are brought to the attention of patients and the public by means of bro@@ chu@@ res , posters and the q@@ gh website .
to take steps to ensure that the q@@ gh quality assurance coordinator and that officer &apos;s work do not in any way inter@@ f@@ ere , ob@@ stru@@ ct or imp@@ air the role and focus on the privacy officer and the privacy rights of patients and members of the public .
this would include at a minimum ensuring that the coordinator receives appropriate privacy training and that there is clear communication between the coordinator and the privacy officer .
health response : the department will give this recommendation serious consideration as it develop@@ s and imple@@ ments health specific privacy legislation .
the responsibility for privacy at q@@ gh is divided between the clinical advisor ( ca ) and the quality assurance and risk management coordinator ( qar@@ m ) .
the clinical advisor is accountable for the development of policy , procedures , practices , and guidelines for ih@@ s .
the ca is also accountable for the development of educational material related to privacy .
the qar@@ m is accountable for the quality , safety , and risk piece , which includes the reporting , analysis , review , capture , and reporting of events ( near mis@@ ses , incidents , and sen@@ tin@@ el events ) , as well as disclosure .
as part of this process , iqaluit health services is currently working on the development of a monthly events reporting and analysis report , which will provide an overview of all events , and will design@@ ate privacy brea@@ ches as a separate item on the report .
the atipp manager and atipp coordinator will be involved to ensure these processes are consistent with legislation and already established protocols .
ip@@ c recommendation # 5 :
that for purposes of dealing with privacy brea@@ ches in q@@ gh , all brea@@ ches be tra@@ cked and privacy incidents be understood to mean only apparent brea@@ ches that haven &apos;t yet been confirmed .
health response : the implementation of an electronic incident reporting system will not be pursu@@ ed until such time as the quality improvement ( q@@ i ) unit is staffed .
the preliminary work prior to the implementation of an electronic system will require the review , revision &amp; stream lin@@ ing of the paper based incident reporting system &amp; developing the business processes to support this implementation .
iqaluit health services is currently tracking all brea@@ ches as part of our events reporting and analysis process .
this means that privacy brea@@ ches are reported , analy@@ sed , reviewed , and cap@@ tured along with all other near mis@@ ses , events , incidents , sen@@ tin@@ el events , etc .
please also see note under item # 4 for more information on planned next steps .
ip@@ c recommendation # 6 :
that the q@@ gh develop a privacy management program to capture the role of a privacy officer , clear and accessible policies and procedures for the collection , use and disclosure of personal health information , staff privacy orientation and training and then , transparency of this program to the public .
a relevant and useful guide is provided by the 2013 coach guidelines for the protection of health information .
such a privacy management program might incorporate the relevant and appropriate provisions of the gn privacy management manual that we have reviewed , subject to our concerns already identified .
health response : health agrees with the need to further develop privacy management programming and has already commenced this initiative .
the department wants to achieve a system that will address the territorial health system , including q@@ gh .
ip@@ c recommendation # 7 :
that the privacy officer for the q@@ gh work with the office of patient relations and the quality improvement coordinator to develop protocols to ensure that the information privacy rights of patients are not in any way com@@ promised or di@@ minis@@ hed by the quality improvement initiative .
this would include ensuring that through posters , bro@@ chu@@ res and the q@@ gh , the public clearly understands the different roles of these offices .
health response : as noted under recommendation # 4 , the responsibility for privacy at q@@ gh is divided between the clinical advisor ( ca ) and the quality assurance and risk management coordinator ( qar@@ m ) .
the clinical advisor is accountable for the development of policy , procedures , practices , and guidelines for iqaluit health services .
the ca is also accountable for the development of educational material related to privacy .
the qar@@ m is accountable for the quality , safety , and risk piece , which includes the reporting , analysis , review , capture , and reporting of events ( near mis@@ ses , incidents , and sen@@ tin@@ el events ) , as well as disclosure .
as part of this process , iqaluit health services is currently working on the development of a monthly events reporting and analysis report , which will provide an overview of all events , and will design@@ ate privacy brea@@ ches as a separate item on the report .
the atipp manager and atipp coordinator will be involved to ensure these processes are consistent with legislation and already established protocols .
the department is exploring possible protocols within the office of patient relations as per this recommendation .
ip@@ c recommendation # 8 :
that the department of health proceed with its stated plan to consider implementing an electronic health record and ensure that the appropriate policies and procedures are in place to accommodate that .
health response : the department of health and department of community and government services have in place a comprehensive plan .
close to 50 % of em@@ r roll @-@ out has been completed and the remainder is anticipated to occur by the end of december 2017 .
ip@@ c recommendation # 9 :
ensure that all health records staff receive adequate training with respect to relevant requirements of ati@@ ppa as well as privacy best practices .
health response : health con@@ cur@@ s that this must be an important practice and standard .
health is committed to conducting an assessment of current practice to identify gaps and best practices .
ip@@ c recommendation # 10 :
that the health records office and operations be reviewed to determine improvements that can be made to security of the paper files , ensuring a sign out @-@ sign in procedure to ensure tracking of movement of the patient file within q@@ gh .
health response : health will commit to review current practices , identify gaps and areas for improvement .
ip@@ c recommendation # 11 :
implementation of a clean desk policy to prevent the accumul@@ ation of patient files on un@@ attended des@@ ks in the records department area .
health response : health does not currently have a clean desk policy for q@@ gh . health will review the current policies and ensure that this item is cap@@ tured .
health will also review scre@@ en lock / current time out within health centres and q@@ gh .
this will also assist in protecting patient files .
ip@@ c recommendation # 12 :
limit the opportunity for other hospital staff to access patient paper files without a clinical purpose .
health response : health supports this recommendation and will follow @-@ up on this recommendation to ensure safe@@ guards are in place to limit access .
the health information management office ( previously health records ) has developed an office access protocol .
access to the office is controlled by an access card , and an access rights list has been developed .
employees of the health information management office and iqaluit health services senior leaders ( executive director and directors ) , as well as nursing managers , have access to the office to ensure due dilig@@ ence in protecting the information , while allowing for access to the information when it is necessary for the purposes of the delivery of care .
ip@@ c recommendation # 13 :
consider how the health records office can provide more support to q@@ gh staff in adop@@ ting and following ati@@ ppa compliant procedures and privacy best practices as outlined in the 2013 guidelines of coach .
health response : health will commit to reviewing and evaluating this recommendation .
ip@@ c recommendation # 14 :
that q@@ gh develop a comprehensive plan including a deadline to complete the con@@ version of paper records to digital format including undertaking a security assessment of the process and the med@@ ite@@ ch system .
health response :
the department of health and department of community and government services have in place a comprehensive plan .
close to 50 % of em@@ r roll @-@ out is complete and the remainder is anticipated to be finalized by the end of december 2017 .
a pi@@ a and tr@@ a was completed prior to implementing med@@ ite@@ ch .
health intends to update the pi@@ a and tr@@ a prior to the end of 2017 .
results of these assessments will be app@@ ended to the original documents .
the i@@ e@@ hr steering committee will review and evaluate the recommendation to address e@@ hr con@@ version from paper to digital format .
ip@@ c recommendation # 15 :
that the q@@ gh consider developing a privacy charter mode@@ lled on the sam@@ ple in appendix b to the 2003 coach guidelines . this would be based on the q@@ gh &apos;s privacy and information handling policies and would be available to patients and the public .
health response : the department will consider this recommendation and how it can apply this initiative across the territory to include q@@ gh .
ip@@ c recommendation # 16 :
that q@@ gh develop and dis@@ semin@@ ate informa@@ tional bro@@ chu@@ res , posters and other educational materials for the general public outlining their rights with respect to access to their own personal health information and with respect to appropriate collection , use and disclosure of their ph@@ i and how they can address concerns about these things .
health response : this initiative is currently being addressed through the department &apos;s review of its patient relations division , the creation of the continuous quality improvement ( c@@ q@@ i ) unit and requirements as part of developing health specific privacy legislation .
ip@@ c recommendation # 17 :
there should be comprehensive comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y privacy training with appropriate privacy training materials for all q@@ gh staff .
this should include training on the med@@ ite@@ ch system .
health response : please see response under recommendation # 8 .
ip@@ c recommendation # 18 :
no employee should become an ac@@ credited user of med@@ ite@@ ch unless there is evidence they have successfully completed the privacy training .
health response : this recommendation is addressed through our current training program .
ip@@ c recommendation # 19 :
when any employee attempts to enter the med@@ ite@@ ch system , the scre@@ en should display a caution against any collection , use or disclosure without a legitimate need for that employee to know the subject ph@@ i .
health response : the department agrees with this recommendation and has commenced its work with med@@ ite@@ ch and our health@@ te@@ ch to complete this work .
it will become a standard message .
ip@@ c recommendation # 20
the &apos; reason to visit &apos; should be a required field for any employee entering the med@@ ite@@ ch system .
health response : this is a requirement on the registration scre@@ en ; however health will review the current format to ensure protection of client privacy .
ip@@ c recommendation # 21 :
q@@ gh should develop a mas@@ king option which would allow a patient to design@@ ate certain elements of their ph@@ i not to be accessible without the patient &apos;s express consent .
health response : this is a business solution that is available within med@@ ite@@ ch .
health agrees with this recommendation and will initiate the process to establish an appropriate policy .
ip@@ c recommendation # 22 :
the q@@ gh should ensure that access to med@@ ite@@ ch is closed immediately upon any employee no longer requires access whether by re@@ sign@@ ation , dis@@ mis@@ sal or change in position or for any other reason .
health response : currently when an employee leaves the employment of the gn , an employee clear@@ ance form is submitted to community and government services .
once submitted , gn @-@ health access is termin@@ ated and the employee can no longer access med@@ ite@@ ch .
once we@@ b @-@ based ambul@@ atory is introduced , health will also include a health it clear@@ ance form that will trigg@@ er the same actions when an employee no longer is employed by the gn @-@ health .
ip@@ c recommendation # 23 :
there should be a policy / procedure for su@@ spending med@@ ite@@ ch access privileges for anyone who has abused their user privileges .

health response : health will review and evaluate current policy to identify gaps and take steps to address this recommendation .
the events reporting and analysis process , which is the same process that is used to identify , analyze , track , and respond to all potential incidents also applied to mis@@ directed fa@@ xes .
as such , when a mis@@ directed fax is reported , it is treated like any other event that potentially constitu@@ tes an incident , and is handled in the exact same manner .
ip@@ c recommendation # 26 :
that q@@ gh ensure that fax machines are in secure areas of the facility not accessible to the general public .
health response : health is in agreement and will implement a plan to effect this requirement .
the department has evaluated the location of all fax machines at q@@ gh .

ip@@ c recommendation # 27
that q@@ gh develop an appropriate email / tex@@ ting policy that specifically addresses personal information and personal health information .
health response : health will review and evaluate current policy to identify gaps and take steps to address this recommendation .

health response : health will review and evaluate current policy to identify gaps and take steps to address this recommendation .
ip@@ c recommendation # 29 :
that q@@ gh ensure that any contracts that involve personal health information of patients of the q@@ gh specifically identify what can and cannot be done with that ph@@ i .
all such contracts should explic@@ it@@ ly incorporate by reference the privacy requirements imposed on any public body by ati@@ ppa .
health response :
&quot; health &amp; medical record &quot; is currently in all contract details outlining the type of records and its protection .
patient identification is also addressed , as well as the exchange of information .
confidentiality clauses are in all gn contracts to include health .
the department will request a review of all contracts to ensure they reference the privacy requirements as imposed by ati@@ ppa .
ip@@ c recommendation # 30 :
that the q@@ gh consider a che@@ ck@@ list for non @-@ consen@@ ted dis@@ closures of ph@@ i to third parties :
has the third party provided authority in writing of one of the 22 sub@@ sections of s . 48 of ati@@ ppa that might permit disclosure ?
is there authority in one of the 22 sub@@ sections of s . 48 of ati@@ ppa ?
is the request for disclosure properly documented so that the q@@ gh has a record of the request ?
is the purpose of the disclosure clear ?
have steps been taken to ensure that the least amount of personal information which is necessary for that purpose is dis@@ closed ?
has q@@ gh re@@ tained a record of the disclosure and relevant documentation ?
health response : health agrees with this recommendation and will conduct a review and develop a che@@ ck@@ list that can be used across the territory and with q@@ gh .
ip@@ c recommendation # 31 :

( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , as minister of executive and intergovernmental affairs , it gives me great pleasure to rise today to introduce a new education sponsor@@ ship program .
the ama@@ aqta@@ arniq education program will spons@@ or long @-@ term , post @-@ secondary education leave for government of nunavut inuit employees .
&quot; ama@@ aqta@@ arniq &quot; means a bu@@ d spre@@ ading roots .
mr. speaker , the aim of this new education sponsor@@ ship program is to remove barriers to post @-@ secondary education for eligible inuit employees and to help the government of nunavut fill professional and specialized positions .
we will establish an ama@@ aqta@@ arniq education program committee to review applications annually and priority will be given to degree @-@ gran@@ ting programs .
mr. speaker , any inuk employee of the government of nunavut will be eligible for this education program , whether they are casual , term , or indeterminate , provided they meet the eligibility criteria .
my department will work with the individuals approved for this program , including support from when they start their studies to when they return to work as government of nunavut public servants .
mr. speaker , the government of nunavut already supports public servants to take education leave to pursue post @-@ secondary studies .
the ama@@ aqta@@ arniq education program will supplement this with funds made available by the settlement agreement for government of nunavut and inuit employees .
mr. speaker , the government of nunavut recognizes the need for qualified inuit in professional and leadership roles within government .
to achieve our inuit employment goals , we are committed to providing programs like the ama@@ aqta@@ arniq education program . ( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .

hon. keith peterson : mr. speaker , my colleagues have heard me speak many times in this house about making the government of nunavut an employer of choice in nunavut .
i am sure that most will agree that we have put in place many positive changes to human resource policies and directives since 2013 .
mr. speaker , we all understand the added stress that having a baby can put on a family . returning to work during this time also ad@@ ds another level of stress and anxi@@ ety to the household .
that is why i am happy to announce another new directive that has been approved and added to our human resources manual .
that is directive 13@@ 08 ( a ) - accommo@@ dating b@@ reas@@ t@@ feeding .
this directive allows the government of nunavut to standardi@@ ze the approach of accommo@@ dating b@@ reas@@ t@@ feeding in the workplace and to handle b@@ reas@@ t@@ feeding accommodations consistently and fairly while demonstr@@ ating the government of nunavut &apos;s leadership and commitment to non @-@ discrimination and accommodation , diversi@@ ty and inclusion , and to the promotion of a harassment @-@ free workplace .

ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
good afternoon .
mr. speaker , i rise today to make a brief statement about the issue that arose between the minister of health and i during yesterday &apos;s sitting of the legislative assembly .
mr. speaker , i had some sympa@@ thy with the minister when he made reference to the &quot; exc@@ es@@ sive &quot; amount of correspondence that flow@@ s through his office .
i can &apos;t recall the last time that he dropped by my own office , but he would also see that neither of us is suffering from a shortage of paper .
mr. speaker , i again acknowledge that the minister did send me a short letter in november of last year after i asked questions in the house about the issue of service contracts outside of nunavut , so i also acknowledge that i could and should have noted that fact during the preamble to my questions yesterday .
however , the question of whether or not the minister &apos;s response fully answered the questions that i had asked him last fall is a matter of interpretation and debate between us .
in order to clear the matter up , i am sure that the minister will welcome the opportunity to respond to my upcoming written questions on this subject , which i will endeavour to pose before the end of our spring sitting .

mr. speaker , it is obvious we all agree that education is integral to a good future , h@@ ence our wishes to create opportunities for our children so that they may have a fru@@ it@@ ful life .

if my grand@@ daughter is watching , i just have three more sle@@ ep@@ s to see you .
&gt; &gt; laughter
i rise today to inform the house about a number of positive initiatives that are underway in gjoa haven .
mr. speaker , gjoa haven &apos;s local housing association has been taking the lead in identifying innovative ways of addressing housing issues in the community .
one of these initiatives is taking advantage of gjoa haven &apos;s most important resource : its own people .
mr. speaker , the lh@@ a has been building capacity in the community by providing opportunities for residents to gain important skills and experience by working on such projects as building ram@@ ps and por@@ ches , renovating existing buildings , and pain@@ ting many housing units .
mr. speaker , like a lot of communities , gjoa haven has experienced problems with vand@@ alism , especially on the part of trou@@ bled youth .
mr. speaker , the housing association has been working hard on identifying these youth and to help them turn their lives around .
instead of dama@@ ging homes and property , youth have been provided opportunities to make a positive difference by working for the lho to repair damage caused by vand@@ alism . that is good news .
mr. speaker , gjoa haven &apos;s housing association is also working on a pilot project called the &quot; ig@@ loo house solution . &quot;
mr. speaker , i seek unanimous consent to conclude my member &apos;s statement .

thank you to my colleagues .
mr. speaker , gjoa haven &apos;s housing association is also working on a pilot project called the &quot; ig@@ loo house solution . &quot;
i have been advised that the original idea for this &quot; tin@@ y house &quot; concept arose from input received from community residents , including elders .
mr. speaker , the housing association has been working with a number of partners , including the high school , nunavut arctic college , and the community men &apos;s group to develop a proto@@ type .
mr. speaker , the goal of the project is to have a low @-@ cost , one@@ - or two @-@ sto@@ re@@ y , single @-@ family d@@ wel@@ ling that can be quickly f@@ ab@@ ri@@ cated and assemb@@ led in the community using materials that are suitable for our arctic environment .
mr. speaker , i have been advised that the pilot project is now underway and is using surplus materials from completed construction projects as well as materials supplied by local businesses .
it is anticipated that the unit will be ready for occupancy this september .
the long @-@ term goal is to allow for more units to be built that will provide for shared mechanical resources while allowing for individual privacy and security for occup@@ ants .
mr. speaker , i wish to take this opportunity to recognize a number of individuals in the community whose hard work is making these positive initiatives a reality : mr. allen kal@@ o@@ on , ms. e@@ mma pauloosie , mr. ron k@@ ly@@ ne , ms. sarah oo@@ gak , mr. w@@ ally por@@ ter , mr. p@@ ats@@ y k@@ leng@@ en@@ berg , mr. ma@@ uri@@ ce tungi@@ lik , mr. mike co@@ us@@ ine@@ au , and mr. o &apos;@@ brian k@@ y@@ d@@ d .

today i wish to rise as i am here thanks to my constituents to whom i am e@@ ter@@ nally grateful . in my role , i represent all constituents who live in my riding and i wanted to first point that out .
also , i wish to move towards the previous announcement made by the minister responsible for nunavut arctic college and the questions raised by the member for iqaluit @-@ niaqunnguu . i thank her for that .
i am here also as a lawyer and an inuk .
inuit are very capable of achieving anything once we are committed to a goal . although we must represent the public , we are all aware that inuit still la@@ g behind and we need to focus on educating them .
i was a proponent of the program that allows our residents to take law courses over several years , and i am glad to hear that it will proceed .
nonetheless , in reading the minister &apos;s statements and responses , i regre@@ tted reading that as inuit , we continue to be kept in the lower r@@ ung@@ s as it per@@ tains to advan@@ cement in education .
i also know that many inuit who are quite capable submitted their applications to this program to be part of the solution and to assist their fellow residents .
this is where i harbour regre@@ ts as i know some of these applicants and their capabilities and i sense their desire to move forward .
i absolutely regret that they will not be part of this limited program .
it is stated that we should represent all constituents . even with that principle , why are inuit under @-@ represented ?
there were several capable inuit who applied and they must now wait for the next round of courses to be offered , possibly in many years from now , if they wish to take a law program .
i want to urge this government to re@@ me@@ dy this state of affairs . we , too , deserve a future that is ro@@ si@@ er and full of opportunities .

i say &quot; good day &quot; to the people of nunavut . to the people of quttiktuq who are watching the proceedings , welcome to the house , as well as our premier and my colleagues .
i am in a che@@ er@@ ful mo@@ od to share in the celebr@@ atory announcements made this afternoon .
mr. speaker , there are roughly only four months left in our term and today i am placing great emphasis on this matter .
i am getting concerned that what i have voiced over my term hasn &apos;t been completely understood .
that is indeed unfortunate and is very sad to see .
this is becoming stressful and it trou@@ bles me .
mr. speaker , what i keep hearing is this : i am a citizen of canada , so all legislation pertaining to canada is what i must adhere to .
this indeed is something i agree to .
however , when we try to adhere to legislation , nunavummiut have difficulty complying with the legislation .
our people are getting shot .
our people are being found frozen outside in the cold .
our people are d@@ ying via traffic acci@@ dents .
this is due to not following the legislation we ought to abide by .
mr. speaker , this legislation we are trying to abide by isn &apos;t what i am against , but rather the fact that i am a canadian citizen and when i am told of my citiz@@ en@@ ry , i can &apos;t always agree since inuit have lost their cultural foundations in our modern lives .
this is very critical and inuit culture isn &apos;t reflected , there@@ by causing inuit to break certain laws .
i have many important things to say , so i would like to ask for unanimous consent to conclude my statement .
speaker ( interpretation ) : the member for the high arctic is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement . are there any nays ?
there are none .
mr. shooyook , please proceed .
mr. shooyook ( interpretation ) : thank you , my colleagues , for allowing me to conclude my statement . i won &apos;t make it too long , but i will try to make it clearly understandable .
mr. speaker , i am quite capable of speaking for a whole day on this subject if i was to try to make everyone understand and it would continue onto the next day as well .
i don &apos;t want to be misunderstood by the public watching on television , my fellow canadian citizens , and my legislative colleagues here .
what i am ad@@ am@@ antly advoc@@ ating is to have the canadian constitu@@ tion recognize inuit traditional knowledge to ensure that i can abide by the legislation without any concerns about my cultural foundations . i want to get approval to have inuit traditional knowledge incorporated into federal legislation , as this would allow official recognition .
with pe@@ tty crimes such as ar@@ son of school buildings and vand@@ alism , if this was approved in one or two years , improvements would slowly materi@@ alize .
this is a critical issue and is the reason for the breakdown in our culture .
i will try to keep it conc@@ ise , as the first circumstances of traditional inuit lifestyles being impacted was when inuit were her@@ ded into communities and our children were taken from us to residential school .
this was the first separ@@ ation from inuit traditional life when our children &apos;s historical connections were broken . apologies were announced about that cultural sup@@ pres@@ sion and compensation was provided to the victims .
the other aspect happened in the 19@@ 60s with a true loss of inuit freedom when our dogs were s@@ lau@@ gh@@ tered by our government over@@ lor@@ ds .
this occurred from 19@@ 67 to the early &apos; 7@@ 0s , where inuit means of independence were s@@ lau@@ gh@@ tered without any compensation .
although many inuit hunters were extremely prote@@ ctive of their dogs , since this was a legal directive , inuit at the time were unable to stop the k@@ illing or get compensated .
this is the biggest reason inuit lives and culture were broken apart .
mr. speaker , with that being the case today , our legislated terms have d@@ win@@ d@@ led to four months , so we have no more room to make changes .
where can this subject i referenced , the legislation and official in@@ corporation of inuit traditional knowledge , come from ?
here i talk about the inuit traditional social resolution rules .
we have no room left to man@@ o@@ e@@ uv@@ re and perhaps after the next round of elections this subject will be completely abandoned .
that is so unfortunate !
i don &apos;t want to see that .
the issues i am speaking to are the social inter@@ active rules of inuit , rcmp inter@@ actions and the court system , which is predi@@ cated upon our canadian court system .
in trying to abide by these ali@@ en criminal laws , inuit are suffering since it is culturally in@@ appropriate to adhere to ali@@ en concep@@ ts .
this is very dis@@ concer@@ ting to my being .
mr. speaker , i ask : where can we co@@ operate and to whom can we direct our efforts towards ?
if the executive council members and lawyers wish to learn , all you need to do is come and ask me about inuit issues and i will gla@@ dly explain the issues and not just be pain@@ ted as the un@@ rul@@ y elder
* see appendix for full text of return to oral question 7@@ 29 - 4 ( 3 ) .
who dis@@ agrees . i can clearly provide the basis for my argu@@ ments .
nonetheless , it is only in the lat@@ ter stages where i have started to get questions about issues and the canadian constitu@@ tion . incorporating traditional inuit knowledge seems to be our only option , as we can &apos;t sid@@ es@@ tep it any further .
i would like to see work on incorporating this as a priority . i want to see that today .
with the importance of this matter and with our culture and lives deterior@@ ating , outsi@@ ders will again suggest that inuit have no laws .
mr. speaker , we have many laws .
these laws are already alive and if accepted , then these laws can be re@@ invi@@ gor@@ ated .
this is an extremely important matter which i want to discuss prior to the completion of our term .
there are still many issues to voice that speak to the sub@@ tle efforts to kill our culture .

mr. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
good day to the people of nunavut and pangnirtung .
i rise to announce that although i spoke yesterday about graduates , today i am speaking about three nunavut sivuniksavut graduates from pangnirtung .
the first year graduate is li@@ ly kilabuk and the second year graduates are av@@ ery keenainak and lynn mike .
i want to share my pride in their accomplishments as numerous students have attended the nunavut sivuniksavut program since its inc@@ eption and pangnirtung alu@@ m@@ ni are many , i believe , ever since the program first opened in 19@@ 85 .
many youth from pangnirtung have taken the nunavut sivuniksavut program where they learned about inuit issues , graduated the course , and gained further capabilities .
many of them are quite independent now as they are taught to be self @-@ sufficient students , even if it is evident from the start .
the students i just mentioned who graduated from nunavut sivuniksavut have had their future bri@@ gh@@ tened .

question 7@@ 77 - 4 ( 3 ) : changes to income support ( rumbolt )
mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of family services .
mr. speaker , yesterday the minister announced some upcoming changes to income support assistance that will take effect on july 1 of 2017 .
can the minister indicate what steps have been taken to inform and explain to income support clients exactly what changes they should expect with respect to the income assistance benefits they will receive after july 1 ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : minister of family services , mr. johnny mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the member for raising that question .
the department of family services , along with the department of economic development and transportation , funded a study . in actu@@ ality it was our government that funded a study on the legislation related to the income support program . i will focus on that aspect in my response here .
at the conclusion of the study and with the presentation of the report , several priority recommendations were made specific to the review related to income support clients served by our department and also to improve the program benefits .
this , along with the sivumut abluqta mandate , was the reason for the review of services provided by our department to assist our residents who require these programs such as income support . this was prioritized as the key measure to improve the program and it was undertaken .
this being the fourth year of our term , reviewing it from above has been quite challenging . we anticipate we will start implementing these changes by july 1 , where improvements will be forthcoming for our clients served by the department of family services within the income support program .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. rumbolt .
mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker .
i am aware there were a lot of changes that needed to be made to income support .
my question was what efforts were made to explain it to the income support recipients in our communities and i don &apos;t think the minister answered it that way .
i &apos;m moving on to my next question .
i appreciate that the income assistance re@@ forms will permit income support clients to earn more income before having their benefits reduced .
can the minister provide more detail on the specific amount of money a client can earn from employment while on income assistance and not have their benefits reduced ?
if the minister does not have that level of detail with him today , can he indicate where nunavut residents can access this information ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of family services , mr. johnny mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i tried to be clear in my response on some of the improvements as to what further work is required to implement them .
the changes to the program are based on the existing criteria for our clients .
as it is right now , if clients accru@@ e some income through various means , such as seasonal employment , carving , or other types of income generation , the income is immediately deduc@@ ted from their monthly income assistance .
this will start to change .
starting july 1 , if a client is single and they earn income through employment , carving , or other means , the limit will now jump to $ 500 .
even if the client rea@@ ches this amount , they will still be eligible for income support .
this was previously c@@ la@@ wed back if their income passed the threshold . this has increased from $ 200 .
for family clients or couples , the income limit threshold has been increased to $ 1,000 . clients will be able to create some dis@@ po@@ sa@@ ble income through savings .
this means that they can still receive benefits through family services . the clients can still make some money up to this new limit of $ 1,000 and continue to be clients under this program .
furthermore , respecting our disabled residents who live in our territory who have qualified for funding through other programs , they used to receive up to $ 175 monthly . this has been increased to $ 250 monthly .
as well , our government will offer a new program of $ 125 per month specific to an emergency temporary work disability assistance program for a period of 6 to 12 months if they suffer an in@@ ability to work and if they are resi@@ ding with another disabled person .
these are the improvements to date which will be implemented by july 1 .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. rumbolt .
mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker .
it has long been a concern of mine that the department of family services is permitted to access the banking information of its income support clients .
i note that one of the income assistance re@@ forms announced by the minister will allow clients to save money in their bank accounts instead of being forced to spend all of their savings in order to qualify for social assistance .
i understand that the minister just announced some limits of the amount they can earn .
can the minister indicate whether there will be any limits on the amount of money that income support clients will be permitted to save in their bank accounts and , if there are , how will he ensure that the relevant information about those limits is provided to income support clients ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of family services , mr. mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
as per my previous outline , we will need to be aware of the clients &quot; ability to save monies from income g@@ arn@@ ered outside of the income support program .
that can only be done by monitoring and working with the client .
the income support workers in the communities will receive training on the new rules and practise filling the new forms with these changes .
with respect to the member &apos;s question about clients being able to save money in their bank accounts , with this new allowance , clients have the capacity to save by increasing the limit . the purpose of this c@@ law back of income had nothing to do with preparing clients for employment .
to focus more on preparing them for employment , these changes are now attempting to look at assisting the clients of our department and give them the ability to save by not having every cent of their hard @-@ earned monies deduc@@ ted from their income support .
we want income support clients to be able to save funds as this can allow a person to get back on their feet and re@@ gain their independence .
this is the purpose and intention . as i identified earlier , the reason is to allow people to re@@ gain their independence and gain meaningful employment , which we want to encourage . that is the main reason .
as to the monitoring of client bank accounts , it is obvious that the workers will have to abide by the proper procedures tou@@ ching upon banking information and privacy .
i am aware of my colleague &apos;s concern related to that and that is why i have responded to his question in this way .

question 7@@ 78 - 4 ( 3 ) : runway extension for naujaat ( mapsalak )
mr. mapsalak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of economic development and transportation .
mr. speaker , when we were in winnipeg , manitoba at the ( interpretation ends ) round @-@ table session ... .
when we were there , the president of calm air had an opportunity to speak . he stated that if the naujaat airport landing stri@@ p was extended by 100 feet , then they could carry 6,000 l@@ b@@ s. more on their aircraft .
mr. speaker , the naujaat airport landing stri@@ p is already very short , yet i have heard that when the terminal was being improved , they shor@@ tened the lights .
mr. speaker , i would like to ask the minister because i know that it will help a great deal if the landing stri@@ p was extended by 100 feet .
sometimes cargo and passengers can &apos;t get on the flight because there is a load limit on the aircraft based on the length of the airstrip .
can the minister ask her officials to find out how difficult it would be to extend our airstrip by 100 feet ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank the member .
we can have our officials review that matter .
currently the naujaat airstrip is , as you know , 3,@@ 400 feet by 98 feet .
an en@@ quir@@ y can be made to the airlines that have aircraft landing in the community to see whether the 100 @-@ foot extension would make any appreci@@ able difference .
the main aircraft that land in most communities is the at@@ r @-@ 42 model and many communities are served by that model here in nunavut .
we would have to en@@ quir@@ e if a larger aircraft would be able to land at the airstrip with that min@@ ima@@ l extension . i have no idea , but we can ask our officials to review this matter .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. mapsalak .
mr. mapsalak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank the minister for agreeing to that .
mr. speaker , it would help a great deal . often when people have a lot of personal items or if they bought big @-@ ticket items like snowmobiles , at@@ vs , and summer equipment , they have to wait a very long time to get them due to how long it currently takes for cargo to make its way to naujaat .
can the minister have this looked into soon or some time this summer ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank the member .
as to what exactly we will be doing , i will just talk to my department about this concern and try to see how difficult it will be to do . i will let my colleague know .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. mapsalak .
mr. mapsalak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . indeed that may be , but when someone responds that way ... .
calm air is the sole airline serving our community . there are no other airlines serving the communities that i represent , especially naujaat . as well , naujaat is the only community in the kivalliq region where the airline can &apos;t accommodate he@@ avi@@ er cargo due to the limited length of the airstrip .
with that being the situation , can the minister agree to have this looked into this summer to determine the comple@@ x@@ ity ?
i would like to at least have a study , even if the work doesn &apos;t proceed , as obviously it would be an expensive extension .
what i ask is that she have this looked into by having an official travel to the community in the summer .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. minister ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. speaker . i also thank the member for asking about that matter .

question 7@@ 79 - 4 ( 3 ) : accounts pay@@ able ( angnakak )
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the minister of finance .
mr. speaker , i am confident that the minister will agree with me when i say that it is important that the government pay its bills on time , especially when we &apos;re talking about small businesses here in nunavut .
as the minister will be well aware , financial administration manual directive 8@@ 03 @-@ 3 provides that , and i quote , &quot; the standard payment term for suppliers listed on the inuit firm registry or the nunavut business registry is 20 calendar days , whereas , it is 30 calendar days for other suppliers . &quot;
can the minister confirm whether or not this standard is currently being met across government ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of finance , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : mr. speaker , i &apos;m not involved in the day @-@ to @-@ day paying of bills to suppliers across nunavut or down south . i do know that the department makes every effort . when the department of finance gets all the bills with the proper documentation , they make every effort to pay the bills according to the directive .
there are situations that occur when proper documentation is not received .
i don &apos;t have the specific details of all invoi@@ ces . i &apos;m sure there are invoi@@ ces that don &apos;t get paid within the 20 days . there are probably invoi@@ ces that are paid way sooner than 15 days .
if ms. angnakak has specific concerns with someone &apos;s bill that wasn &apos;t paid , i would be more than happy to take that information and follow up .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , ms. pat angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker . i thank the minister for his kind invitation .
i will take advantage of that .
i am sure that i am not the only mla who has received concerns from businesses regarding the length of time that it can take to get paid by the government .
although i recognize that every situation is unique , i would hope that the department of finance is keeping a careful eye on whether or not some departments are experiencing more problems than others .
can the minister clarify how the department of finance ensures that the f@@ am @-@ mandated timelines for payment are being met across government ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of finance , mr. keith peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
again , as i said earlier , i &apos;ve got constituents of my own who have come to me with concerns and i have followed up .
i don &apos;t want to name names , so i won &apos;t , but after following up , we determined that the invoi@@ ces never got to the right place .
they were sending invoi@@ ces in late or without the documentation .
the departments are required to follow up . we &apos;re not going to just pay a bill based on &quot; pay me $ 20,000 . &quot; it &apos;s got to have some proper documentation so we know that the services were ordered or provided .
there has to be confirmation that the services were received . the department of finance can &apos;t initiate payment on an invoi@@ ce unless the department s@@ ends us the paperwork .
it is incumb@@ ent on the departments to ensure that when they get an invoi@@ ce from a ven@@ dor , they make sure it &apos;s complete and then they send it to us , and then our internal systems will track and confirm that it &apos;s on schedule to be paid .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker . i thank the minister for his response .
it &apos;s not always the ven@@ dor who is at fault ; sometimes the government is .
for the benefit of our constituents following today &apos;s proceedings , can the minister clarify what steps a business should take if it is not being paid on time by the government ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of finance , mr. peterson .
hon. keith peterson : thank you , mr. speaker .
ven@@ dors can follow up with their mlas or follow up with the deputy ministers in our department .
i think they are all listed publicly .
i have received emails and phone calls myself from ven@@ dors .
i have to caution , if people think they aren &apos;t being paid on time and then we follow up and it turns out that they didn &apos;t submit the paperwork , the documentation , we are going to ask them to do that .
go back to the ven@@ dor . go back to the person who contracted them or sent them the purchase order and start the process that way and tell them that you haven &apos;t been paid . within the department i &apos;m sure there are mechanisms to allow the ven@@ dor or the supplier to follow up with &quot; where is my payment ? &quot;

question 7@@ 80 - 4 ( 3 ) : inuit employment plans ( joanasie )
mr. joanasie ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the premier .
last week the premier announced that the government is close to finalizing a &quot; master inuit employment plan . &quot; can our premier confirm today when this new plan will be publicly released ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. premier of nunavut , hon. peter taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker . i appreciate the question from the member .
mr. speaker , when we started out our mandate here in 2013 @-@ 14 , we had indicated that we wanted to increase the numbers for inuit employment .
i know in the past it was very difficult , going back to 1999 , when the funding that we got from the federal government was very small , approximately $ 10,000 a year .
through hard work we managed to increase our funding from the federal government and through the nunavut settlement agreement .
this is the first time ever that we are coming up with an overall gn plan and it is something that is very near completion . i can say that i &apos;m hoping that i could either sign it today or tomorrow .
it &apos;s something that we have to continue to carry on and this is more or less a first generation inuit employment plan that includes every department , every corporation , in fact 15 al@@ together , 15 departments and corporations .
this master plan is going to be something that &apos;s going to be adhered to by the departments .
again , in the past , when there was more or less a sho@@ t@@ gun approach to the inuit employment plan , it wasn &apos;t based on actual data . since 2015 we have data . we have historical data that we can actually use and base our decisions on that in our strategy .
this is something i &apos;m very proud of because again i &apos;ve got to say that you don &apos;t increase inuit employment in the government by having hot@@ dog parties . this is something that we &apos;re going to take very seriously .
with this plan , it &apos;s the first of its kind and i &apos;m hoping i could do it within this week .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. joanasie .
mr. joanasie ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) i have spoken before in this house about the importance of clearly identifying the number of positions in the government that need to be filled by inuit in order to achieve a representative workforce .
for example , the government &apos;s most recently tabled quarterly employment report indicates that only 348 out of 1,7@@ 38 professional level positions in the public service are currently filled by inuit .
in order to achieve an 85 percent employment level , approximately 1,@@ 130 inuit employees will need to be hired over time in order to fill the present gap .
that number is almost the size of clyde river .
can the premier confirm that the government &apos;s new master inuit employment plan will include these kinds of detailed analy@@ ses ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
premier of nunavut , mr. taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
since 1993 , through the rati@@ fication of the nunavut land claims agreement , article 23 has been a process since 1999 , where we &apos;re trying to increase the number of inuit employment within the territorial government . there are obligations too for the federal government to increase those numbers .
i &apos;ve got to say that there have never been so many training programs and assistance for the ones that are employed now to increase the level of supervisor , manag@@ er@@ ial and professional positions within the government .
we have many training programs and the programs are certainly increasing .
with that we certainly hope to get to a representative number , but keep in mind that as things evol@@ ve in nunavut , there are other things that are evol@@ ving economi@@ cally . there are other jobs out there that didn &apos;t exist previously .
again , there &apos;s a fairly high number of training programs that we administer through arctic college and through eia , again , with the help of nti and an advisory committee . also , mr. speaker , as you know with the 2015 nunavut settlement agreement with canada , we have opportunities there too for long @-@ term training , for professional inuit to be trained so that they can gain employment , not just in the territory but everywhere . first and foremost we want those inuit to work within our territory and close to home .
mr. speaker , the opportunities are there . minister quassa and i both sit on the maki@@ giaq@@ ta training corporation , which is run by nunavut tunngavik incorporated . there are opportunities there for every level of organization to access funding from there to train inuit .
it &apos;s specific to inuit only . again , the inuit employment training plans , yes , there are those obligations and strategies to include those .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. joanasie .
mr. joanasie ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
the premier &apos;s statement about the government &apos;s master inuit employment plan did not make any reference to the work of the maki@@ giaq@@ ta inuit training corporation . as he stated , both the premier and the minister of education sit on this entity &apos;s board of directors .
can the premier clarify the role of the maki@@ giaq@@ ta inuit training corporation in developing and supporting the government &apos;s master inuit employment plan ?
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. speaker , in 2015 , when the settlement agreement was signed with canada , nunavut tunngavik incorporated , and the government of nunavut , there were obligations and sti@@ pul@@ ations within the agreement to set up such training entities as the maki@@ giaq@@ ta training corporation and to have government representatives on the board .
mr. speaker , we work with in conjunction with nti to maximize the training opportunities . we want to make sure that we don &apos;t dupli@@ cate the training programs , whether the government is doing that or nunavut tunngavik incorporated through the maki@@ giaq@@ ta inuit training corporation , and we &apos;re aware of that .
i am not the head of the inuit maki@@ giaq@@ ta training corporation , but we work very closely with nti through that board to ensure that funds expended maximize the benefit of training inuit for employment going into the future .
thank you , mr. speaker .

question 7@@ 81 - 4 ( 3 ) : qulliq energy corporation activities in taloyoak ( qirngnuq )
mr. qirngnuq : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ) i say &quot; good day &quot; to my fellow residents of kugaaruk , the people of taloyoak , and my colleagues .
( interpretation ends ) my questions are for the minister responsible for the qulliq energy corporation .
in november of last year taloyoak &apos;s new power plant was completed .
as the minister will be aware , the mayor of taloyoak wrote a letter to the minister in april of this year .
in his letter the mayor requested an update on the status of de@@ commission@@ ing the community &apos;s old power plant .
can the minister update me today on the status of de@@ commission@@ ing the old power plant in taloyoak ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister responsible for the qulliq energy corporation , hon. johnny mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;ll have to look into the present status as i am not aware of it .

we will proceed onto the next item . ( interpretation ) oral questions .

question 7@@ 82 - 4 ( 3 ) : issues with medical travel ( sammurtok , a )
mr. alexander sammurtok ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
good day to my fellow residents of rankin inlet and nunavummiut .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , i would like to direct my questions to the minister of health .
mr. speaker , in the winter sitting my colleague from baker lake raised the issue of elders being st@@ ran@@ ded at the rankin inlet airport .
the minister indicated that his department was looking into the flexibility and the options that are available in rankin inlet to address this type of situation .
can the minister provide an update on what kinds of options are provided for rest and res@@ pite to medical clients in rankin inlet that have been considered to date ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of health , mr. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
when we &apos;re talking about boarding homes in rankin inlet and in addition to that cambridge bay , it is something that has been looked at and analy@@ zed . there are discussions with health canada , who assists us with setting up these types of facilities .
that being said , there are reco@@ ur@@ ses available and i would never want to see anyone , especially an elder , having to han@@ g out in the airport for hours on time or not have a place or a safe place to go to .
we do have availability of day@@ rooms that can be arranged at hotels .
we also have like a patient relations office or medical travel people can get a hotel room for people if their stay gets extended or if there &apos;s a delay in their flight .
right now there are procedures in place to find some type of an accommodation for all medical travel trav@@ ell@@ ers if there &apos;s any type of flight delay .
as far as negotiations or discussions with health canada , those are ongoing , so i wouldn &apos;t be able to say anything firm today .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. alexander sammurtok .
mr. sammurtok : thank you , mr. speaker .
the minister in part answered the question that i was going to ask , but i &apos;m going to go ahead with my question .
mr. speaker , in his previous response on this issue the minister of health indicated that in case of extended delays for medical travel clients , his department negotiated day@@ rooms in rankin inlet hotels so that individuals who are going to be in the community for a period of time can have a safe and clean place to rest .
can the minister clearly describe how his department determines when a day@@ room of this type is needed and what steps are necessary to make the necessary arrangements ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of health , mr. hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate the member raising this . it gives me an opportunity again . if somebody is delayed for longer than two hours , they can contact their medical travel contact and arrange to have a day@@ room set up .
that being said , not everyone wants or needs that type of service , so it is initiated by the patient travelling .
if they know that their flight is going to be delayed for more than two hours , they can contact medical travel and they will arrange accommodations for people to go to .
a number of people have family in the area or friends where they may wish to han@@ g out , if you want to call it that , with family and friends if there &apos;s a delay . it is a patient @-@ initiated request and those requests are dealt with immediately .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. alexander sammurtok .
mr. sammurtok ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) i am sure the minister would agree that having a permanent , full @-@ time boarding home would make it much easier to provide a safe and comfortable place for medical travel clients to go to , whether they are st@@ ran@@ ded in the community for an extended period of time or whether they are in the community for other medical reasons .
a local company , pi@@ tuk supplies and services , has already submitted a proposal to establish such a facility in rankin inlet .
can the minister confirm whether this proposal is one of the options being considered by his department to address the need for the boarding home services in rankin inlet ? if not , why not ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of health , hon. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
as i responded earlier , discussions with health canada are needed . as they help fund boarding homes and help establish rates , any type of discussions have to include health canada .
with regard to the specific proposal that the member has raised , i &apos;m not aware of it . maybe it has been sent to my officials and it &apos;s under analysis . it &apos;s something i &apos;ll look into and i &apos;ll get back to the member .
thank you .

oral questions .
member for tununiq , joe enook .
question 7@@ 83 - 4 ( 3 ) : status of decentralization ( enook )
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions today are for the minister of executive and intergovernmental affairs .
last week the minister tabled his response to my recent written question concerning the status of decentralization .
his response indicated , and i &apos;ll say this slowly as i don &apos;t want to make mistakes in the number , that 14 of the government &apos;s decentralized positions in pond inlet were vacant as of march 31 , 2017 .
six of those positions had been vacant for more than six months or more , and five of those vacancies were all in the department of community and government services .
mr. speaker , recognizing the leadership role that the premier has with respect to ensuring the success of decentralization , i would like to ask him : can you indicate what direction you have given to the minister of community and government services to prioritize and acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate the recruitment process for these vacant positions ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of executive and intergovernmental affairs , hon. peter taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate the question from the member .
mr. speaker , there are many vacant positions throughout the government and throughout our communities .
specifically to his question , we have always instructed our department of finance to ensure that these positions are filled as quickly as practical . there are a lot of positions that aren &apos;t filled and some are filled with casuals and some with term . those don &apos;t necessarily reflect the numbers of the positions being filled , but i certainly sympa@@ thi@@ ze with the member .
it &apos;s not just within his community ; there are many communities that are affected .
mr. speaker , as i look at the data here , the numbers of un@@ filled positions are going down throughout the territory , so that &apos;s a good step forward .
we want to ensure that these numbers continually go down .
as indicated previously , there are many un@@ filled positions , but as you can see on the chart there , these numbers are continually dro@@ pping . it &apos;s a trend that hopefully continues on .
mr. speaker , specific to the cgs positions , i &apos;ll have to speak with the minister responsible and get detailed information on the specifics of that and possibly get back to the member specific to that question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
one of the ex@@ cuses that i am often given for why vacant positions in pond inlet cannot be filled in a timely manner is that there are problems with the availability of staff housing .
the minister &apos;s response to my recent written question indicated that the government &apos;s current review of the staff housing policy will re @-@ examine the &quot; category rating system used to prioritize staff housing by position . &quot;
his response also indicated that the review is &quot; expected to be complete by july 2017 . &quot;
mr. speaker , we all know that it &apos;s now june .
will the minister commit to tabling the conclu@@ sions from this review during our september sitting of the legislative assembly ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
premier and minister of executive and intergovernmental affairs , mr. taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
again i thank the member for that question . mr. speaker , again , that &apos;s one of the things that we had indicated that we &apos;re going to be doing , doing the reviews on programs and such things as policies and other matters .
that included a lot of different things within our departments and our corporations .
once i have the detailed information in front of me , i &apos;ll be certain to make sure that the member from mittimatalik knows exactly when i can table that document .
again , as we indicated in the past , we are hoping to complete all of the review and have all the information available for the members before the end of this term . i &apos;ll certainly look into that and make sure that information gets passed on down to the member .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
we will also expect that information . i know the review will be completed before july 2017 and i expect it to be completed and ready for the fall session .
mr. speaker , the minister &apos;s response to my recent written question concerning the status of decentralization indicated that the federal government will , and i quote , &quot; complete a nunavut inuit labour force analysis report in the last quarter of 2017 @-@ 18 in consultation with the gn and nti . &quot;
can the minister clarify what role the government of nunavut is playing in this process ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of executive and intergovernmental affairs , hon. peter taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
i sure hope that we have the same documents of returns or responses to the written question , but i &apos;ll certainly look into that .
it &apos;s something that we want to ensure the right things are done , especially when it comes to employment in our smaller communities . again , decentralization is a plan that we want to adhere to .
as you know , we want to maintain the 60 percent of the number of employees outside of iqaluit . that &apos;s one of the things we want to maintain .
again , in the past i have indicated that we &apos;re working hard with our hr people and our hr negoti@@ ators when it comes to devolution .
those numbers are going to change dr@@ as@@ tically . mr. speaker , we want to ensure that we &apos;re prepared for that type of situation .
again , we want to ensure that these positions within the smaller communities are looked at seriously and filled .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
oral questions .
member for iqaluit @-@ sinaa , mr. paul okalik .
question 7@@ 84 - 4 ( 3 ) : removing social promotion in nunavut schools ( okalik )
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) we all agreed that education would be a priority during this term through sivumut abluqta .
in our earlier session i quoted the premier about his prior commitment to removing social promotion in the classroom in the territory .
yesterday i tabled a document that had been signed by the previous premier , which opened the doors for social promotion formally .
the premier mentioned that this issue would be addressed in the amendments to the education act that were being put forward when he responded to me last .
in looking at the proposed amendments that were put forward , there is no mention of social promotion being removed .
i ask again : when will the premier honour his promise and remove social promotion from the classroom in the territory ?
( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker : the hon. premier of nunavut , mr. taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
again , i did answer that question previously , but as you know , there are difficulties within the amendments to the education act . mr. speaker , since this is going to be operational , i &apos;ll defer the question to the minister of education to explain the operational side of that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of education , mr. paul quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
since he spoke in english , i &apos;ll be speaking in english .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , i would like to point out that the directive is dated 2013 and at no point does it endor@@ se or support the concept of the term &quot; social promotion . &quot;
my department does not support in any way the term &quot; social promotion &quot; and never has . the directive see@@ ks to explain the cooperative roles of various school staff , deas , and parents when seeking to determining student achievement and communicating to parents .
mr. speaker , the government of nunavut is committed to providing nunavut students with the best learning opportunities available .
as a minister , my role is to ensure that all students receive the highest quality of education possible and that student outcomes are the main focus of our school , our work , and partnerships . ( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. okalik .
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) you can choose to call it any other way you want , but it &apos;s social promotion .
it &apos;s passing students on to the next grade when they haven &apos;t met the competen@@ cies outlined in this actual directive .
you can call it whatever name you want , but it still continues today .
i ask the premier once again : when will he honour his promise and remove this artificial education system ?
( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. premier of nunavut , mr. peter taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna : thank you , mr. speaker .
again , i &apos;ll simply say that i &apos;ll pass on operational discussions to the minister responsible for that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of education , mr. paul quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i want members to understand that the issue under discussion is not one we believe in nor does it exist . there is no policy to that effect .
there are no policies directing this idea the member is suggesting and the term he is using . i don &apos;t understand nor do i have any idea where the term emerg@@ ed from .
the practice today , to ensure all of us understand , is our students are taught the grade level they are at , whether they pass or fail the grade . this is what is used .
within our schools , partnerships e@@ mer@@ ge between the affected parties as to what future each student has . the parties are the school principal or vice @-@ principle , including other staff such as counsellors or advis@@ ors and the parents .
they work together to determine the future of the student and whether they will pass to the next grade or remain in the grade .
these are the practices we use . the way a student is kept in a grade isn &apos;t done without planning .
i am unsure if my colleague has actual examples where he has seen that , as i have never seen that practice myself .
as i stated earlier , once all students have completed their grade competen@@ cies , they are graduated to the higher grade .
if any doubt exists , then what i stated would apply with respect to the operational procedures .
i just want to repeat here with respect to this word used today in english , which i don &apos;t think has an equiv@@ al@@ ency in inuktitut .
with respect to this word my colleague used in his first comment , there is nothing written about whether we support or disagree with that concept in the document he tabled to the house .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. okalik .
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) i turn to page 4 of 15 of the document that i tabled , it &apos;s titled &quot; social promotion , &quot; is &quot; allowing a student to proceed from one grade to the next without achieving the required competen@@ cies and without a learning plan that supports remediation or growth . &quot;
this is the actual directive that i tabled yesterday .
i ask the premier once again : when will he rever@@ se this directive that was issued on the last days of the previous government , and can the premier commit to honour@@ ing his commitment to removing this directive ?
( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of education , mr. paul quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
this was given out as a directive in 2013 .
as the minister of education , i have maintained my position while in this role that this directive is not in effect nor will it be referred to or even the concep@@ tual con@@ no@@ tations will not be used .
we have already announced and the premier had previously stated that this is what we are following now .
however , what i want to clarify here related to the member &apos;s question is the connection to bill 37 . it still hasn &apos;t entered the legislature . if he did have a concern , we can discuss it with him open@@ ly if he wishes to change the wording .
further , i want to repeat here that there is no such policy in the government related to that matter which the member referenced .
it was a previous government that enacted that policy .
nonetheless , we as a government have maintained that we don &apos;t believe in that concept nor do we want to see such a practice .
i explained the process where students are promoted to a higher grade and how this promotion is approved . how the parties work together is clearly highlighted , including the parents who must be involved .
the parent has to know exactly what will happen to their child and whether or not they will move on to the next grade .
we have no interim policy in place anywhere .

question 7@@ 85 - 4 ( 3 ) : fur pricing program ( keyootak )
mr. keyootak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of environment .
mr. speaker , during our winter session i asked the minister about furs sent out for auction , specifically polar bear hi@@ des . i believe these polar bear hi@@ des have sat at the auction house for quite a long time .
mr. speaker , i keep asking this question due to some of my constituents &quot; wishes to clearly understand the current situation as they have pati@@ ently wa@@ ited for results . many hunters have had their furs sit without being bought .
mr. speaker , during the winter session the minister &apos;s response was an auction would occur in the springtime .
does the minister know if any furs that were previously sent down get sold during that auction ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of environment , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i can inform my colleague that some of these polar bear hi@@ des have been sold , but roughly 300 hi@@ des have yet to be sold .
there are two main reasons for this .
back when the hi@@ des were sent down , the market prices were quite high and the hunters received a commen@@ sur@@ ate ap@@ portion of the expected price when they sent the hi@@ des down for the auction .
when the market dropped , the interest in purchasing the hi@@ des also dis@@ appeared .
secondly , some of the polar bear hi@@ des can &apos;t be ex@@ por@@ ted outside of canada . the canadian government has stated that certain polar bear hi@@ des from the baffin region can &apos;t be ex@@ por@@ ted outside of canada .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. keyootak .
mr. keyootak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank the minister for clarifying that .
mr. speaker , i wonder if the minister can indicate for the benefit of the public when the next auction sale is or if it is too difficult to ascertain whether another auction would be held .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of environment , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
it is unfortunate that i didn &apos;t really understand his question . was he asking when another auction would be open ?
can my colleague clarify his question as to what exactly he is referring to ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
member for uqqummiut , please clarify your question .
mr. keyootak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
during our winter session the minister indicated that an auction would be held in april for the fur auction house .
now with april having already come and gone , does the minister have information as to the next scheduled fur auction for the hi@@ des that were sent ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of environment , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank the member for clarifying that .
yes , an auction was held in april and i am unsure when the dates are for the next auction , but i believe it is scheduled for june .
however , the polar bear hi@@ des currently there are available for sale at any time , as any person can go to that store any@@ time to purchase a hi@@ de , if they agree to the sale price . these hi@@ des can be bought at any time .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. keyootak .
mr. keyootak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
the hunters who sent out their hi@@ des were paid a specific amount based on the expected price if their furs are bought . since they received a pre @-@ payment , some hunters received a substantial amount based on the percentages at the time of shipping the hi@@ de .
now , if these hi@@ des can &apos;t be sold , will the hunters who received the pre @-@ payments receive an invoi@@ ce for the hi@@ des ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of environment , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
this winter he asked the same question and i responded by saying that those hunters will not receive a bill or be required to pay money back if their furs are not sold at auction . now , if the furs are sold and the price was lower than what the government paid initially , then yes , according to the government regulations , an invoi@@ ce would be sent for the over@@ age .
we know that the market price for polar bears is low and some hi@@ des haven &apos;t sold in quite some time .
we anticipate working with the people who run the au@@ ctions or consider returning the hi@@ des to nunavut if they haven &apos;t sold in some time . perhaps we can return them for purchase and use here by coming to an agreement with the hunter and if agreed to , then the pre @-@ payment amount would be all they receive .
however , no decisions have been made as to how the process for that would be laid out .

question 7@@ 86 - 4 ( 3 ) : summer studies at nunavut arctic college ( angnakak )
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my next question to the minister responsible for nunavut arctic college .
mr. speaker , the nunavut arctic college campus generally closes down during the summer months .
i feel that this is an unfortunate loss of opportunity for students , college students , high school students , and even part @-@ time students who are trying to upgrade their skills and qualifications to catch up on academic work .
one year ago about or a little over , june 3 , the minister indicated that he was looking into options to keep the college open during the summer .
the minister has had a year to review and approve these options .
can the minister provide an update on what steps are being taken to keep nunavut arctic college open for courses during the summer ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister responsible for nunavut arctic college , mr. paul quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank my colleague for her question on that matter .
as it stands , we presented a report on that as we conducted a review starting with piqqusilirivvik .
piqqusilirivvik is sometimes open in the summer since the operations are based on inuit traditions and some classes are specific to the summer seas@@ ons , so it is open at certain times .
that is why the review started with piqqusilirivvik .
we are currently reviewing the larger community learning centres and regional campuses to see how we can use them during these periods .
with respect to the inuit language , many of our government workers are unable to speak in inuktitut . due to that reason , we have contempl@@ ated summer classes that would be open for specific subjects within our campuses in the larger communities .
we are thinking of offering inuktitut courses for public servants wishing to learn inuktitut , as they are our priority . this is part of our deliberations .
further , parts of the programs offered at piqqusilirivvik could be offered in smaller communities , either in the summer or when it is conveni@@ ent . all communities are different and each community has their own i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ cra@@ si@@ es of culture , such as ways of hunting and building things .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re focusing on right now . if we can get it started this summer and it runs smoothly , then we can build on it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate that keeping our college campus open during the summer months will also incur additional costs and expenses for operating the facility and providing classrooms and staff .
however , by not investing in the ongoing education of nunavummiut , the costs to our society may be even greater in the future .
can the minister clearly describe what kind of cost analysis has been applied to deciding whether or not to open nunavut arctic college during the summer months ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of arctic college , hon. quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
as to how much that would cost , it is being looked at right now . we can &apos;t open up anything just like that .
i explained the first steps that need to be done . we have enough resources right now to get it started , but then we will have to find out actually how much it &apos;s going to cost .
after we start the first program , we will be able to get a good idea of how much it will cost . right now i can &apos;t give you an actual figure as to how much it will cost . we ask for new funding every year .
at the moment we are going to try to do it with the budget that we have now . we will only find out how much it is going to cost after we do the initial trial run this coming summer .
we are really trying to get that started because it would be a good fit .
it is understandable that in the sum@@ mer@@ time a lot of people want to go on holidays and our teachers also want holidays in the sum@@ mer@@ time .
we will have to try to figure out a way to do that . will we be ordering teachers to come ?
those are some of the things we will have to consider .

question 7@@ 87 - 4 ( 3 ) : staff housing ( rumbolt )
mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation .
as the minister had the opportunity to see with his own eyes when he visited sanikiluaq earlier this year , the community continues to suffer from a shortage of staff housing , a problem which impacts the ability of the government to fill such essential positions in the fields of health care and education .
last fall the legislative assembly approved $ 5.@@ 0 million in capital funding towards the construction of new staff housing units during the current 2017 @-@ 18 fiscal year , including two new units for sanikiluaq .
can the minister update the house today on the status of the tender for this construction ?

mr. speaker , i don &apos;t have current information on where it &apos;s at on the question about our staff housing work .
i have the information that was given to me on may 25 .
i &apos;m sure more work has been done since then .
the construction of staff housing units in sanikiluaq was 99 percent complete in may , and they may be occupied today .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. rumbolt .
mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;m not sure where the minister is getting his information , but from my understanding this is new construction coming this year and the ships haven &apos;t even arrived . i &apos;m not sure how he can say it &apos;s 99 percent complete .
mr. speaker , moving on , last fall the legislative assembly approved $ 500,000 in capital funding for modernization and improvement of staff housing units across the territory .
on average that works out to just $ 20,000 per community .
can the minister indicate if this amount is adequate ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation , mr. george kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
i want to apologize to the member because i thought he was referring to the ones that were built earlier .
if i can go back in regard to staff housing for sanikiluaq and what the status is for this construction , the contract was awarded to build a du@@ plex in march .
i do apologize to the member for giving the wrong response .
again , for the supplementary question , i can &apos;t remember because of the mistake i made .
mr. speaker , with your permission , i would like to ask the member to repeat his second question so that i can respond accordingly .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
the minister would like you to rephrase your question . mr. rumbolt .
mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the minister for his clarification on my first question .
my second question was asking about the $ 500,000 in capital funding that was approved for staff housing repairs , which works out to only $ 20,000 per community in nunavut .
i asked the minister if this amount is adequate in order to maintain the current staff housing .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation , mr. kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
i also thank the member for his question .
in regard to the $ 500,000 for modernization and improvement of staff housing units , i agree that this amount is not nearly enough . however , we can reconsider the amount because we need to provide funding for modernization and improvement of staff housing and public housing units .
as long as we continue to make do with inadequate amounts of money , we will continue to lobby the canada mortgage and housing corporation or the federal government for more funding .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. rumbolt .
mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker .
i am aware of at least one staff housing unit in sanikiluaq that has been vacant for almost a year because the unit needs repairs .
can the minister assure me today that this unit will be repaired before the end of the summer and the start of the new school year ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation , mr. kuksuk .
hon. george kuksuk ( interpretation ) : thank you very much , mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t have the information on the vacant unit that he is referring to . i will look into it . i know that my officials at the housing corporation are watching and listening .
if it &apos;s possible , i would be very happy to have that information before the end of this session . if it &apos;s not possible , then i will make sure that i provide the information to him at a later date .
thank you , mr. speaker .

oral questions .
member for tununiq , mr. joe enook .
question 7@@ 88 - 4 ( 3 ) : foster parenting for profit ( enook )
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
my question today is for the minister of family services , my angaju@@ ks@@ akuluk .
i was questioning minister mike yesterday and i would like to go back and make a reference to his responses . i will follow the blues for june 6 , 2017 and i do know that they are not the final hansard .
mr. speaker , yesterday when i was asking questions to the minister , we were discussing whether or not people are taking in foster children just to make money .
in his response he indicated that he will look into it and review it carefully to make sure that there were no instances of that kind .
mr. speaker , my question is this : was the minister saying that he has not heard of foster parents just taking in children for the money ?
is that what he said ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of family services , mr. johnny mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
personally i have never heard of such cases .
i have received correspondence from his constituency and we &apos;re looking into the matter . i have directed my staff to review it and then from there we will see if there are any people taking in foster children just for the money . i can respond by saying that my staff are currently looking into the matter , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
further , for the benefit of my angaju@@ ks@@ akuluk , my question has no relev@@ ance or relationship to the correspondence you mentioned as having recently received .
this has nothing to do with my question whatsoever .
now , the minister stated that he had never heard of any cases .
let me ask him this : if any such case were to surface , and in the past stories of this happening have fil@@ tered down to some of us , what policies do you have in place to ensure this never happens ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of family services , hon. johnny mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you .
if there were such cases , then social services workers would look into it . if there was a need for a review , then our rules would apply .
i wasn &apos;t expecting to hear such a question , but i can say that the social workers in our communities know about everything that happens in their communities and they would look into it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i know that family services officials would conduct a review .
what i am trying to ask here with my question is : are there existing policies in place should such a case e@@ mer@@ ge that provide guidelines or procedures to put a stop to this type of behaviour ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of family services , mr. mike .
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : this would immediately be stopped once a case came to the attention of the officials .
it is obvious that the reason would be to ensure the safety and protection of the child . also , if we find cases where foster parents applied only for the revenue generated by having foster children placed in their homes , it would be a griev@@ ous act .
that is why this type of case couldn &apos;t be handled by existing policies .
if a case emerg@@ ed , then it is obvious that it would impact the foster child and the family . it would also impact the status of the foster parent .
if that occurred , it would obviously be dealt with by utilizing existing departmental policies and legislation , including the over@@ ar@@ ching need to protect the foster child . these would be the only avenues .
if that was the case , then the first priority is to ensure the child &apos;s safety .
that is the usual practice .
it would involve the with@@ draw@@ al of their status as foster parents if that was ever determined to be the case .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
oral questions .
member for aivilik . mr. steve mapsalak .
question 7@@ 89 - 4 ( 3 ) : community access road program ( mapsalak )
mr. mapsalak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i will direct my question to the minister of economic development and transportation .
mr. speaker , over the past winter funds were ear@@ marked for the access road program and breakwater repairs . this fund was increased , which was grati@@ fying to hear , as many people depend on this fund in my constituency .
mr. speaker , i wonder if the minister can respond to my question . with the set increase in this fund , will it include a cap on each community application under this program , either for access road or breakwater repairs ? will there be a cap set for applications ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
with respect to the recent appropriations approved for the program , i am unsure whether a cap or limit will be set . his question was whether this additional funding will result in a cap for community applications .
mr. speaker , i can only respond that this additional funding approved resulted in an increase of $ 2.5 million and it was specific for the 2017 @-@ 18 fiscal year . it was what we call ( interpretation ends ) one @-@ time funding . ( interpretation ) however , our future government may have to contempl@@ ate their options , if any . if they are also encouraged to increase these funds , as you have , they may deliberate those options .
what i can state now is that this fund received many applications , but i don &apos;t have the information on the funds that were approved last year .
this fund will allow us to partially catch up with the demand , as many applications are sent . to date the total amount of all the applications has sur@@ passed the available amount that was approved by the members .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. mapsalak .
mr. mapsalak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i apologize if i was not clear with my question about whether a cap was contempl@@ ated .
the reason for my question is my other constituency community of coral harbour absolutely depends on this funding . the road is now quite dist@@ ant as it takes about five hours to reach the current site where they are building the access road to . it is obvious that a lot of funding is used just to reach the site .
having seen their local project first hand , which the minister has seen as well , they are progressing quite fast . it also allows opportunities for development , which will be beneficial to the residents of coral harbour .
the reason i asked is because this is one @-@ time funding .
has a funding limit has been placed for each application ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank my colleague for that question .
yes , this project underway near coral harbour , as per the member &apos;s comments , is quite far from the community that falls into the area where they want to construct an access road . we had anticipated them reaching their goal this summer , at least from s@@ nip@@ pe@@ ts of information .
with the way this fund is set up now , it doesn &apos;t have a limit in place for each application , but it &apos;s more in terms of the amount of funding required based on the percentage of the funds we now have . i believe , with the increase , it will still require allocations regi@@ onally to the communities as some communities will apply for more funding while others have smaller amounts .
we will carefully review each case .
some communities may be asked to submit a two @-@ year funding application to ensure that only the priority section of the project can be completed while the other parts can be applied for at a later date . that is another option we have .
officials consult with the applicants on the actual needs without setting a limit and our officials then negotiate with the applicant on the type of funding they would receive .
we want to have as many projects funded as possible .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. mapsalak .
mr. mapsalak ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank the minister for her response .
i think i understood her response that many communities apply for the fund and it &apos;s obvious that many communities do apply for these funds .
is the minister saying that when they are negotiating the funding agreements , it results in real progress and incremental improvement for these communities ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of economic development and transportation , ms. monica ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i also thank the member .
applications for this funding are processed in this manner : the feasibility of the project is reviewed , along with the overall goal of the access road and ( interpretation ends ) objectives ( interpretation ) of the community , and their capability to complete the project . this includes whether they have the capacity and personnel to complete their project .
as well , it can be per@@ ce@@ ived as an economic development project if they provide employment for loc@@ als , as well as what equipment is provided for the project . the finances and in @-@ kind contributions each applicant can provide are included in the review , either the number of employees or machines each community alloc@@ ates for the projects .
these types of details are included in the review when assessing the feasibility of each project .

item 9 : replies to opening address
reply to opening address 001 - 4 ( 3 ) : mr. paul quassa ( quassa )
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to respond to the hon. commissioner &apos;s opening address to the legislature and nunavummiut at the opening of this current session on june 2 , 2015 .
mr. speaker , in her speech the commissioner under@@ lin@@ ed the importance of education to the current mandate of this government , particularly our work on language and literacy . those were her priorities according to her speech .
i am pleased to say that updated curriculum for inuit language arts from kindergarten to grade 6 is almost ready for ro@@ l@@ lout .
this curriculum , which is based on a significant amount of research and development , will dr@@ as@@ tically improve the way that inuktitut is taught and delivered in all of our schools .
the final review and preparation for implementation will happen in the current fiscal year .
this includes preparing inuktitut @-@ speaking teachers and principals to use the curriculum effectively .
we expect full ro@@ l@@ lout to happen in the 2018 @-@ 19 school year .
mr. speaker , the commissioner also spoke of the vital work to develop and launch the inuktitut guided reading program as part of the ongoing balanced literacy initiative .
the guided reading series was developed in consultation with experts in education and the inuit language to ensure that they are well foun@@ ded and relevant to student development in the nunavut context .
mr. speaker , the guided reading series is the first of its kind for nunavut and represents the highest quality literacy materials developed to date for the inuit language .
i would like to update my fellow members about the objectives of this vital project . over the next three years it is expected that the guided reading program will be developed at least to grade 7 in inuktitut and to grade 4 in inuinnaqtun , along with associated teacher training materials to ensure effective implementation in the classroom .
by 2020 we &apos;re expecting that there will be over 500 level@@ led books available in inuktitut and approximately 300 books in inuinnaqtun , with associated teacher resources to support reading , writing and word work , which are important to our schools .
mr. speaker , the guided reading series will improve the literacy outcomes for students across the territory in their first language , inuktitut and inuinnaqtun . this in turn will improve their learning outcomes across all programs of study by ensuring that student progress is accurately assessed by teachers and reported clearly to parents .
development and implementation of the guided reading program and the updated inuktitut language arts curriculum represents an en@@ or@@ mous amount of work on the part of my department .
this is a no@@ te@@ worthy and exciting moment for education in nunavut that will have a positive impact for our students .
these projects are something we can be very proud of as a territory and will contribute to establishing a strong bilingual program .
in addition to curriculum and resource work , my department is also addressing the issue of human resources .
my department is currently working on a rev@@ amp@@ ed inuit employment plan in collaboration with nunavut tunngavik incorporated .
the plan will be developed within 2017 and it will contain short@@ - , medi@@ um@@ - and long @-@ term goals and strategies .
this forward @-@ thinking plan will focus on the entire employment cycle , which includes pre @-@ employment , orientation , mentor@@ ship , retention , professional development , and promotion .
the plan will aim to reduce training and recruitment barriers for inuit for all roles within schools and at the department , including leadership roles .
the plan will increase the number of inuit educators prepared to use inuktitut as a language of instruction .
this is essential in achieving the legislated objectives of delivering a fully bilingual education system and graduating students fully pro@@ ficient in the inuit language .
this work , along with the ongoing review of the nunavut teacher education program , is an important step to ensure we have the human resources and inuit educators in place for a truly bilingual system .
we must always remember though that the challenge we face in achieving our goal of a fully bilingual education system from kindergarten to grade 12 is not just a lack of inuktitut @-@ speaking teachers . to create curriculum , assessments , and resources , we need a standardized inuit language and education @-@ specific vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary .
some of this work has happened to date . however , this ongoing priority has been met with a lack of political will for many years now , despite recognition of its importance to improving educational outcomes .
as minister of education , i need the support of the members of this house on this issue . this question does not get the attention it deser@@ ves , despite the fact that a standardized vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary is the foundation that we need to make inuktitut the first language in our schools , our government , and our businesses here in nunavut .
without standardization of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary , other efforts to improve our system will not be effective . we will not be able to achieve our goals .
standardi@@ zing vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary will take time , especially for upp@@ er level secondary courses . standardization does not mean losing local dialects .
we know from lessons with other languages , green@@ lan@@ di@@ c for example , that it is possible to teach a standardized version while maintaining the strength of community and regional dialects .
the department of education plans to make this a priority moving forward , and we need to support the writing system and standardization of the inuktitut vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary . it &apos;s going to benefit through this .
i &apos;ll be speaking in english , mr. speaker .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , all of the work that i have described is part of the implementation of sivumut abluqta and its priorities and objectives .
as you know , sivumut abluqta states that &quot; education is the foundation for employment and self @-@ reliance of individuals and families .
government , communities , teachers , parents , and students share responsibility for improving education outcomes to provide the best possible opportunities for the future . &quot;
the review and improvement of the education act is a central objective of sivumut abluqta .
this was the purpose of the work of the special committee to review the education act in 2014 and 2015 .
i was pleased to join my fellow mlas , george hickes , simeon mikkungwak , ms. pat angnakak , and mr. joe savikataaq as we tou@@ red nunavut and spoke with stakeholders for over a year .
the special committee acted as a voice for this legislative assembly . it made 23 recommendations with respect to student outcomes and operations , and directed that certain priority amendments be dealt with in the life of this government .
the recommendations focused on how to make our education system better , including making the delivery of programming more consistent to improve student outcomes no matter where they live in the territory or if they have moved between communities .
mr. speaker , by introducing bill 37 , the government is working to meet the recommendations of the special committee .
prior to the review of the special committee , the office of the auditor general conducted a review of the implementation of the education act .
the findings of the report and its recommendations were comprehensive , and my department and i agreed in full with the changes that needed to be made .
in response to the recommendations , we have made great stri@@ des in our policies and programming with respect to curriculum , balanced literacy , and parental engagement .
however , there is still more to do and some of the work that was identified by the auditor general requires legislative changes .
bill 37 represents the changes needed to improve the implementation of the education act by making vital changes to how the system operates .
these operational improvements are common sense and based on the logi@@ c that students need a system that is consistently delivered , but also where there are clear avenues for local input , priorities and know @-@ how .
( interpretation ) in addition to the work of the special committee and the auditor general , government consultation in 2016 guided the development of bill 37 and resulted in major al@@ ter@@ ations to the proposals that were consulted on .
public consultation is essential and i thank all members of the public , the district education authorities , and our education partners who participated .
the department hosted 10 public meetings in all regions of the territory .
by september 2016 the department had met with dea representatives from across all regions and the vast majority of deas took the opportunity to send representatives to attend two separate consultation meetings .
all stake@@ holder organizations were consulted with during this time .
officials from nunavut tunngavik incorporated and my department had lengthy and productive discussions over the course of the summer of 2016 .
nti made a series of formal written comments in regard to the work we were doing . my officials responded fully to nti &apos;s written submissions and many of their ideas are included in bill 37 .
we noted that many of nti &apos;s recommendations are non @-@ legislative . my department has indicated to nti that a ro@@ bu@@ st and continuing working relationship will be required moving forward in order to collaborate on programming and policy initiatives .
this includes the ongoing work to develop an updated inuit employment plan for educators and the implementation of that plan .
mr. speaker , the 2016 consultations made a difference and the feedback was incorporated throughout bill 37 . feedback resulted in new proposals being added to the bill .
many of the original proposals were modi@@ fied to reflect local priorities and concerns , and some proposals were dropped al@@ together based on the second consultation process .
mr. speaker , we have made an effort to listen and learn from what we heard and bill 37 responds to many concerns heard during the consultations .
new ideas that were incorporated include the creation of the dea council to improve supports for deas and additional clarity about the purpose of locally driven enhancements to the education program , additional clarity about the purpose of locally @-@ driven enhancements to the education program , additional clarity with respect to the processes and timelines for individual student support plans and related parental rights , as well as increased government accountability in reporting and communication with nunavummiut on how the government is meeting the needs of students .
mr. speaker , i am not just speaking to the people of nunavut ; i &apos;m speaking to my colleagues here as well .
as mlas we have to properly review proposed legislation .
mr. speaker , i want to speak for a moment about why amendments to the education act are necessary .
we all know the purpose is to address and fix operational challenges that have exis@@ ted since 2008 , but also to establish an act that is forward @-@ looking . we also know that our government is big and we always have to keep that in mind .
the changes being proposed will increase consistency of delivery across the territory . increased consistency in schools will improve the quality of education , resource development , and the ability to properly assess students and student outcomes .
currently schools do not have the direction they need to effectively implement the bilingual education models .
schools can choose how to deliver the model .
this lack of direction creates an unacceptable level of in@@ consistency between different schools , which im@@ pe@@ des the delivery of the curriculum and impacts on how resource materials are developed , all of which impacts on student outcomes .
bill 37 addresses this issue by providing a mechanism to the minister of education , working with the deas , so that the minister can give directions on how each bilingual education model is delivered . these directions will involve assi@@ g@@ ning the language of instruction for each grade and program of study , and it will help achieve much @-@ needed consistency .
currently in nunavut we do not have standardized instruction minutes , which is the time spent on each program of study each week . it &apos;s not explained very well in the present legislation . bill 37 provides a mechanism to do this , which is an important step towards having better assessments to help track student progress and teaching quality .
there would be a lot less confusion if it &apos;s set up properly like this . that is what bill 37 is trying to do . being able to properly track student progress and teaching quality is fundamental so that we will know where our students are at .
bill 37 also provides a mechanism to make school calend@@ ars more standardized than they are now . that &apos;s what bill 37 tries to do , but let us be aware that it does not take all control away from local communities in the development of their calend@@ ars .
it simply ensures that there are consistent and efficient opportunities to do high @-@ quality teacher orien@@ tations and professional development . teachers need to upgrade their skills as well . that would give us an opportunity to do that .
we have also known that grade 12 graduation day is not the same day across nunavut .
we &apos;re trying to see how we can set it up so that they can have gradu@@ ations during the same time period .
( interpretation ends ) bill 37 ensures that there are clear roles and responsibilities for everyone working in the education system .
my staff and i recognized the consultation feedback that we did not propose the right balance of responsibilities between the district education authorities , schools , and department .
we have made many changes to our proposals so that bill 37 strik@@ es a better balance .
in response to the recommendations of the special committee and the auditor general of canada , the proposed amendments find an appropriate balance with respect to capacity , training , and specialized expertise for the roles assigned by the education act .
this will improve how our system functions and does not in@@ appropriately constra@@ in local input . instead it focuses the work of deas ( district education authorities ) on the functions that their input is needed on : programs that will ensure local schools reflect local needs , priorities and values .
bill 37 shi@@ fts responsibility to the principals for the implementation of the inclusive education provisions in schools .
principals are expected to have the expertise needed to manage oversight .
deas , or district education authorities , are still given vital roles in ensuring parental rights for student supports .
bill 37 also ensures that deas will know what is happening in their schools with respect to meeting the needs of their students so that they can advocate for their communities when the student needs are not being met .
another example of a common @-@ sense shift in responsibility is the proposal to make the department responsible for the administration of principal and vice @-@ principal appointment panels .
principals and vice @-@ principals are government employees . their employment rights are established in the public service act , the government human resources manual , and the nunavut teachers association collective agreement .
the minister is responsible for compliance with all of these rules and therefore it is logi@@ cal and common sense for the department &apos;s human resource professionals to manage the administration of appointment panels to ensure that all rules are followed .
bill 37 ensures that advocacy and capacity is strength@@ ened for deas by establishing the dea council , which will have the staff and funding needed to carry out enhanced responsibilities , including dea training and support .
by establishing this organization in the legislation , there is an opportunity to ensure increased accountability for the spending of public funds and accountability for important issues , such as records management , protection of privacy , and council elections .
( interpretation ) the department recognizes the hard work of district education authorities while at the same time no@@ ting the significant capacity and administrative challenges they face in our communities .
legislative amendments will address this imb@@ al@@ ance between responsibility and capacity while also respecting the benefit of local impact on schools and students .
this will improve operations across the territory in schools and at dea meeting tables .
language of instruction has been a much @-@ discussed topic with respect to bill 37 . i recognize the concern amongst nunavummiut , partners , and stakeholders that the amendments in bill 37 will have an impact on the implementation of inuktut as a language of instruction in the nunavut education system . i want to briefly go over some of the reasons why i am proposing changes to the education act and the inuit language protection act .
bill 37 establish@@ es that a parent has the right for their child to be educated using inuktitut as the language of instruction during the majority of instru@@ ctional time .
if this change is made to the inuit language protection act , it means that more than 50 percent of instru@@ ctional time must be in inuktitut .
that &apos;s what bill 37 is proposing to do . it identifies what percentage of instru@@ ctional time must be in inuktitut .
this change is proposed for several reasons .
the proposed change provides a clear entit@@ le@@ ment for inuit language rights for nunavut students , that being the right to have the majority of instruction in inuktitut as the language of instruction .
part of the purpose of this right is to make this right clear to all parents .
while we &apos;re on this subject , for example , we will be increasing the use of inuktitut as the language of instruction following the increasing number of inuit teachers in the school system .
i &apos;ll be speaking in english .
( interpretation ends ) in nunavut we have a bilingual education system and two languages of instruction in the classroom .
this is established in the 2008 education act and is a core policy recommendation in the 2000 bathurst mandate , the 2006 ber@@ ger report , and the 2015 report of the special committee to review the education act .
the proposed changes to the inuit language protection act establish the proper legal foundation for a bilingual education system that supports graduating students who are fluent in the inuit language .
nunavut &apos;s bilingual education system is not quite ready for full ro@@ l@@ lout across all grades .
to address this , the department of education continued to work to rev@@ am@@ p the nunavut teacher education program in collaboration with nunavut arctic college ; the ongoing development of an updated inuit employment plan in collaboration with nti ; and the implementation of that plan , which will increase the number of inuit educators in our territory .
finally , to establish standardized vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary for programs of study at all grade levels , particularly the upp@@ er secondary course level , standardized vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary is a central building block for inuktitut instruction .
( interpretation ) there are some important changes in bill 37 that have not received much attention in public conversations or coverage about the bill .
i want to bring attention to the practical aspects of the bill that have been ignored and that i fear may not be considered fully . these aspects are the following :
the proposed amendments increase government accountability by ensuring that the government is consistently and thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly reporting on its work with respect to the implementation of bilingual education and inclusive education , and how it is meeting the language rights and support needs of students .
those have not been considered fully .
it would be up to us to ensure that the information gets out there .
bill 37 , in response to consultation feedback from the representative for children and youth , ad@@ ds an affir@@ mation to the education act of the territory &apos;s commitment in the public education system and to the united nations convention on the rights of the child .
bill 37 expan@@ ds the role of skilled inuit cultural experts to include people of all ages , not only elders .
the younger people , for example , can teach about hunting or sewing and they are now knowledgeable in all other aspects of the inuit culture .
this measure will offer an avenue of increased employment in the communities and increased engagement , especially of young men and women who have mas@@ tered traditional skills .
consultation feedback indicated that the role of the department in supporting the development of local education program enhancements must be clearly established in the legislation . the amendments do this and also bring greater clarity to the purpose and structure of local education program enhancements , something the 2008 legislation does not do . this will help guide the deas in their work to identify and develop these programs .
bill 37 establish@@ es clear timelines for development of individual student support plans .
an amendment in bill 37 establish@@ es that the minister , in addition to being required to establish territory @-@ wide assessments of numer@@ acy and literacy skills , would have the discretion to establish territory @-@ wide assessments on any other learning outcome .
there were a lot of discussions taking place in regard to bill 37 and there are still quite a number of questions . i would like everyone to know and i have indicated earlier that we are open . we have to be very open to the people out there before the bills are given assent .
i can say in english that ( interpretation ends ) i continue to be fully prepared to discuss and com@@ promise on the proposed amendments .
i made this very clear in our letter to the standing committee of may 9 , 2017 .
at a minimum we should be able to say to nunavummiut that we made an effort as a legislature to improve the education act .
( interpretation ) i would also like everyone to know that there was a wide variety of discussion when it came to the review of the legislation and the recommendations of the auditor general of canada and the special committee to review the education act . i &apos;m just reiter@@ ating that we are open and as we indicated earlier , it still applies today that education is of utmost importance .
this is something we wanted to accomplish and we agreed that we would review the education act . we would like this to go ahead so that we can improve the education act . the people of nunavut also wanted to see an improved education act .
we have to work together to create a better education system that operates efficiently and effectively . we can improve student outcomes to prepare young nunavummiut to become social , economic and cultural leaders .
while we have this opportunity , let &apos;s all try to take this issue seriously .
thank you .

you can now proceed with your opening comments , mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. chairman .
bill 25 , an act to amend the consumer protection act , is the result of an ongoing commitment by the department of community and government services to update nunavut &apos;s consumer protection legislation so that nunavummiut are provided the same level of consumer protection as consumers in other canadian jurisdictions .
i have worked closely with the standing committee on legislation to ensure that any concerns that they may have , have been addressed . i am happy to have the opportunity to outline the proposed changes in this bill before the house today .
the major changes to the legislation under these amendments include cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fees and unfair business practices .
at this time i would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much . ( interpretation ends ) does the chair of the standing committee have opening comments ?
mr. t. sammurtok .
mr. tom sammurtok : thank you , mr. chairman .
as chair of the standing committee on legislation , i wish to make some opening comments as the committee of the whole begins its consideration of bill 25 , an act to amend the consumer protection act .
as members will recall , bill 25 received second reading on october 25 , 2016 and was referred to the standing committee on legislation for consideration .
mr. chairman , bill 25 proposes to introduce new provisions to the current legislation that are intended to provide further protection for consumers in the following areas : relief from un@@ cons@@ ci@@ on@@ able loan transa@@ ctions , protection from unfair business practices , and regulation of cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fees .
for a number of years the department has been planning to introduce amendments that would provide for the regulation of cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fees .
members of the standing committee appreciate that the department also took this opportunity to bring the current legislation up to par with similar legislation in other jurisdictions by introducing those new provisions that will allow nunavummiut to seek relief from un@@ cons@@ ci@@ on@@ able loans and protection from unfair business practices .
mr. chairman , bill 25 will provide the minister with the power to introduce regulations that may limit or prohi@@ bit cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fees in nunavut .
the department has indicated that it plans to introduce regulations that would limit cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fees for government cheques .
the standing committee emphasi@@ zes that any regulated cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fee must take into account the financial reality and needs of nunavut residents , specifically the high cost of living that nunavut residents experience .
the standing committee also emphasi@@ zes that government cheques should be defined to include local housing organizations , and therefore is in full support of an amendment to clause 4 of bill 25 .
mr. chairman , that concludes my opening comments .
the standing committee recommends the passage of bill 25 , as amended , to all members .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
general comments .
i don &apos;t see anyone raise their hand . ( interpretation ends ) i have no more members on my list for general comments .
we will now proceed with the clause @-@ by @-@ clause review of bill 25 .
i believe everybody has their legislation binders now . ( interpretation ) bill 25 , ( interpretation ends ) an act to amend the consumer protection act . clause 1 .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
when the minister was done with his opening comments , i was supposed to ask this question then . minister savikataaq , welcome and good afternoon .
i would like to get clarification on cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fees . we usually go to the co @-@ op store and the northern .
those are the two stores that are very pro@@ min@@ ent in our communities . they are the largest stores .
i &apos;m not sure about your community , but they are the largest retailers in my community .
currently we have federal legislation for cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fees and i believe there are no fees for cas@@ hing federal cheques .
what about fees for government of nunavut cheques ? what is the process for them here ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. chairman .
my understanding is that there are no actual regulations on government of nunavut cheques . some retailers do not charge for cas@@ hing government cheques , but there are no regulations . the regulations that are in place for cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fees are federally regulated and they are aimed at the banks and not the retailers .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
obviously you do consultations once you feel the new legislation is ready for public presentation and you take into consideration what you hear from the public , whom we represent , and we are obli@@ ged to take into consideration what we hear from the public before we consider any legislation .
have you ever considered that there are no fees for cas@@ hing nunavut government cheques , especially in the larger stores such as the co @-@ ops and northern ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. chairman .
yes , it was part of the consultation process . if i can re@@ direct this question to ms. jo@@ d@@ i dur@@ dle @-@ awa because she was directly involved in the consultation process .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman : thank you .
ms. awa .
ms. dur@@ dle @-@ awa : it is something that we have considered .
it wasn &apos;t brought up in terms of feedback from the general public , but it is something that we have considered .
the feedback we did receive from the retailers indicated that they &apos;re not in favour of any sort of limit to what cheques fees can be applied to .
it is certainly something that we would be willing to consider . we haven &apos;t started the regulation process yet and that will be forthcoming once we &apos;re completed this bill .
thank you .
chairman : thank you .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you .
the stores like the co @-@ op and northern would not be in support of this in order not to have cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fees for government cheques , which leads me to my next question .
as we are all aware , we have co @-@ op stores in the majority of the communities in nunavut . our co @-@ ops are our own stores ; we own the stores . we control the stores and they &apos;re not controlled by outsi@@ ders .
each co @-@ op can make regulations or policies on their own for anything because this store is owned and operated at the community level . they &apos;re not controlled by outsi@@ ders .
have you consulted with all the co @-@ op stores in each community ? were the responses similar to each other or were they totally different from each other ?
did you consult with each co @-@ op store in nunavut ? i &apos;m not talking about the northern stores because they &apos;re out of our control , but the co @-@ op stores are our own .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. chairman .
as this is part of the consultation process again , i will pass this one on to ms. jo@@ d@@ i dur@@ dle @-@ awa , as she was directly involved in the consultation process .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman : thank you .
ms. dur@@ dle @-@ awa .
ms. dur@@ dle @-@ awa : thank you .
appendix c of the last correspondence we had with the standing committee includes the report on consultations .
we started with letters to the retailers , to their headquarters in winnipeg . we did do phone surveys of the local co @-@ ops and it &apos;s outlined on page 2 of the appendi@@ ces .
we were able to contact a total of 17 co @-@ ops . we had trouble getting any information from some of the co @-@ ops .
each co @-@ op , as the member suggested , has their own rules and so they differ in terms of the fees that they charge . all the information that we collected is outlined in the appendi@@ ces .
six of the co @-@ ops charge no fees on government cheques . one charged a f@@ lat fee of $ 2.@@ 50 for non @-@ co @-@ op members .
six co @-@ ops charged f@@ lat fees for all cheque cas@@ hing and their prices rang@@ ed from $ 2 to $ 10 . two of these would waive the fee if part of the cheque &apos;s value went into a particular co @-@ op service .
one co @-@ op specified that it has to be 10 percent of the cheque &apos;s value . one co @-@ op would only cash cheques that were deposi@@ ted at the co @-@ op and would only allow with@@ draw@@ als of $ 200 per day .
two co @-@ ops charged percentage @-@ based fees and 1 percent for non @-@ government cheques and 1.5 percent for government cheques .
two co @-@ ops used a two @-@ ti@@ ered fee system rang@@ ing in price from $ 2.@@ 50 to a maximum of $ 15 or 2 percent depending on the value of the cheque .
thank you .
chairman : thank you .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
i &apos;m a bit confused now , as usual . for example , in pond inlet we have the co @-@ op that we control , operate , and own .
why is winnipeg included ? is the co @-@ op owned by nunavummiut or are we members of the winnipeg one even though the co @-@ ops are independent ?
if i can ask another question at the same time , although i hear that there are various cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fees in different co @-@ op stores , i note that the northern stores are included , but i &apos;m not asking questions about northern stores because we don &apos;t own and control them and we can &apos;t do anything about them , at least me personally .
the co @-@ ops charge different fees . i was asking about what you said that you would like to do .
what was the input from each of the co @-@ ops in the communities ?
did they agree or make any recommendations during the consultations as community @-@ owned co @-@ ops ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. chairman .
the reason ac@@ l in winnipeg would have been in contact and consulted with is because , i believe , all the arctic co @-@ ops in nunavut are part of ac@@ l .
i don &apos;t know the exact relationship in terms of what they dicta@@ te to the ac@@ ls .
i guess the clos@@ est way to try to explain it in my view is the ac@@ l is the mother company of all the arctic co @-@ ops in nunavut . that &apos;s how i see it .
the cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fee has been brought up many times and we have heard that where there are elders or people who are not well off are getting charged huge amounts for cas@@ hing cheques .
this is one of the reasons why we are dealing with it . how we &apos;re going to deal with it is once the amendments are passed to the act , we can make regulations limi@@ ting what people can charge for cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fees .
we are t@@ reading a fine line here because , during the consultations , the retailers said that this is a service they provide for nunavummiut .
they don &apos;t have to cash cheques if they don &apos;t want to and they said that if it becomes too financially bur@@ den@@ ed or too cumber@@ some , then they may stop providing the service .
when the regulations come out , we will be t@@ reading a fine line and coming up with a balanced approach to regul@@ ate the cheque @-@ cas@@ hing fees .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
thank you for that explanation .
i just wanted to get clarification .
since you are t@@ reading through a fine line here , do i understand that our co @-@ op stores that we own in our communities are saying , &quot; if you do this , we will stop cas@@ hing cheques &quot; ?
did you hear that coming from our co @-@ op stores in nunavut ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. chairman .
my understanding is that recommendation came from ac@@ l and other retailers , but the ones from the co @-@ op came from ac@@ l that it &apos;s a service that is provided and if it becomes too financially bur@@ den@@ ed , then they wouldn &apos;t do it .
they said that what they want to avoid is liabilities in terms of they take people &apos;s cheques , give cash out , and then they have to bring more cash in if the cash leaves the community .
that is a liability . it &apos;s just something that they &apos;re willing to keep char@@ ging roughly what they charge now .
right now the average for northern retailers is $ 3 a cheque or 1.5 percent of the cheque value .
that &apos;s the average right now . some charge more and some charge less , but that is the average currently .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
lastly , do i understand , when you were doing the consultations , our co @-@ ops in the communities themselves were not able to talk to you on their own ? were they not able to express their opinions and you had to get it from winnipeg instead in terms of what they can do ? it wasn &apos;t our co @-@ ops up here that said that , the ones that we operate or manage , and it was ac@@ l in winnipeg that said that .
do i understand that correctly ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. chairman .
the member is correct .
the local co @-@ ops gave what they charge , but none of the local co @-@ ops put forward a recommendation .
thank you , mr. chairman .

mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .

item 2 : ministers &quot; statements
minister &apos;s statement 333 - 4 ( 3 ) : educational upgrade program ( hickes )
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
increasing inuit employment , retention and development is important for the department of health to build a stronger , self @-@ reliant health system .
further , the department is committed to the development of a supportive inuit employment plan that encourages and develop@@ s nunavut inuit . to this end , the department of health has developed an educational upgrade program that provides educational opportunities to support and increase the number of inuit public health workers in nunavut .
mr. speaker , the educational upgrade program offers nunavut inuit exciting opportunities for career advan@@ cement and promotion , and to be active participants in their career choices .
to be eligible for the program , employees will hold either a high school diploma or mature student status .
the educational upgrade program uses a la@@ d@@ dering approach to educational advan@@ cement ( i.@@ e@@ . moving from a certificate qualification to diploma and eventually atta@@ ining a university degree ) .
students who successfully complete this diploma program will have an opportunity to transfer credits to thompson rivers university in british columbia to complete the bachelor &apos;s degree in health sci@@ ences .
mr. speaker , currently 15 health employees are enrolled in the diploma program in community health promotion at the n@@ ative education and training college ( net@@ c ) in ontario .
students are expected to graduate from the program by january 2019 .
mr. speaker , measures and supports are in place to promote student success .
academic tu@@ tors have been recru@@ ited and are providing comprehensive academic support to our students .
recently the students completed a five @-@ day final examination pre@@ p course here in iqaluit to support and prepare them for their first se@@ mes@@ ter exams .
mr. speaker , education was targeted as a key commitment and priority of our government , as outlined in our sivumut abluqta four @-@ year mandate .
i am extremely pleased that the department of health is working to advance career opportunities for nunavut inuit in health . going forward , the department of health has identified mental health and addiction as the priority area for the next academic training in preparation for the september 2017 in@@ take .
thank you , mr. speaker .

hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
good day to the residents of my community and fellow members .
mr. speaker , i stand before you and my fellow members today because i wish to express my pride in our young people and my thanks for the dedication of our educators and educational staff across the territory .
every day our young people are working towards achieving excellence in their education , and they are being supported by a dedicated team of educators and staff .
earlier this week we recognized and celebrated a young student from iqaluit , who is on a fast @-@ track to medical school , and with the close of this school year igloolik , sanikiluaq , and clyde river will see the highest graduation rates in their schools &quot; histori@@ es .
mr. speaker , all of the people that work in our education system are focused on the success of our students .
together we are implementing key tools to support students and continually improve the quality of our education system and resources .
for example , we are proud of the development of over 300 inuktitut books for our guided reading program , the initi@@ ation of the development of the guided reading program in inuinnaqtun , and the upcoming implementation of our updated k to 6 inuktitut language arts curriculum .
mr. speaker , i appreciate this opportunity to stand before the house and recognize all the success of our students and the positive work of our staff and educators across our great territory . we often hear negative comments about our education system or the loss of our language and our culture , but i want us to remember our successes too .
i want our children to know we are working hard for their futures , and i want to make sure that we don &apos;t forget how important it is to encourage each other as we work towards achieving all our dreams for the future of nunavut .
i am grateful to work with such de@@ voted people and to par@@ take in celebrating the success of our students .
mr. speaker , i think we can all look forward to the positive contributions our students will make to our communities in the future .
thank you , mr. speaker .

premier and minister of executive and intergovernmental affairs , mr. peter taptuna .
minister &apos;s statement 335 - 4 ( 3 ) : new policy development program for public servants ( taptuna )
hon. peter taptuna ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
good afternoon , my colleagues , nunavummiut , and kuglukturmiut .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , as minister of executive and intergovernmental affairs , i rise today to introduce to my fellow members a new comprehensive policy development program for government of nunavut employees .
government of nunavut policy @-@ makers must have the knowledge , skills , and cultural compe@@ tence to develop legislation , policies , and programs that respond to and reflect the unique circumstances and needs of nunavummiut .
policy @-@ makers must also enable a healthy , culturally att@@ un@@ ed work environment in nunavut &apos;s public service . we must develop inuit to become policy @-@ makers through a combination of training and career development programs .
mr. speaker , this policy development program will provide modul@@ ar , classroom @-@ based learning in three series :
policy foundations - for inuit employees interested in exploring a career in policy ;
policy training - for policy professionals and policy managers ; and
policy leadership - for senior leaders who provide oversight for policy development and implementation .
mr. speaker , my department issued a request for proposals in january to design and deliver the policy development program and awarded to p@@ g@@ f consultants incorporated and the institute on governance .
we are currently in the curriculum design phase and aim to launch the program for its first in@@ take in the fall of 2017 .
dalhousie university will also review the program for consideration towards advanced standing accredi@@ tations to some of their post @-@ secondary programs .
mr. speaker , the new policy development program supports the fourth assembly &apos;s mandate , sivumut abluqta , by developing public policy @-@ makers to enable a strong , sustainable , and representative public service in nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
minister &apos;s statement 336 - 4 ( 3 ) : spot devices ( savikataaq )
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i want to remind people that they have a responsibility to be prepared when going on the land .
it is important to have a trip plan and that you let your family members know where you are going and when you expect to return . you need to bring extra fuel and supplies and it would be wise to know how to fix your machine if it breaks down . if you are new to travelling on the land , go with someone who is experienced .
mr. speaker , satellite phones are expensive , so i don &apos;t expect that everyone would have access to them . that &apos;s why my department provides spot devices that are available in every community free of charge . when you sign one out , you are responsible for bringing it back so that others can make use of it on their travels .
mr. speaker , as leaders in our communities , we have a responsibility to share the message of being prepared . we should do this to support search and rescue volunteers because the more we are prepared , the less pressure is on the overall system from the ground up .
mr. speaker , we all play a role in that system . we all are responsible for taking care of ourselves and our fellow nunavummiut .
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister responsible for the qulliq energy corporation , mr. johnny mike .
minister &apos;s statement 337 - 4 ( 3 ) : energy wise campaign ( mike )
hon. johnny mike ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
good day to the people of nunavut and pangnirtung .
i am pleased to announce that the qulliq energy corporation has partn@@ ered with the government of nunavut &apos;s climate change secretariat and the nunavut housing corporation to launch a new energy wise campaign .
( interpretation ends ) the energy wise campaign ai@@ ms to encourage nunavummiut to become more aware of the energy we use and the impact of our energy consumption on our environment .
by reducing our energy consumption , we can lower the amount of fossil fuel we burn and decrease the amount of greenhouse ga@@ ses we release into the environment and in turn lessen our impact on the changing climate .
( interpretation ) in addition to helping the environment , saving energy at home also means saving money .
small energy savings add up quickly to make a difference in reducing our energy bills .
the qec continually looks for ways to op@@ timi@@ ze its energy use through energy @-@ efficient technologies and practices .
its partnership with the nunavut housing corporation and climate change secretariat to promote energy awareness supports the qec &apos;s vision to provide a sustainable energy supply to nunavummiut and the government of nunavut &apos;s goal in the prudent use of our resources .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , i invite nunavummiut to visit the energy wise nunavut face@@ book page or our website to read about ways to save energy , save money , and help protect our environment .
remember to power down , head outside and enjoy our territory . ( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .

hon. keith peterson : mr. speaker , this marks the 60@@ th anniversary for the northwest and nunavut territories annual mine rescue competition held in yellowknife .
this annual event allows mines to evaluate and compare the effectiveness and quality of their mine rescue training programs .
teams participate in the spirit of competition and collaboration to understand how other teams work while testing their own mine rescue skills . judges evaluate each event , which range from safety equipment checks to simul@@ ated disas@@ ters .
there are eight teams competing this year and nunavut is represented by three teams , hope bay gold mine ( t@@ ma@@ c resources in@@ c . ) , me@@ ad@@ ow bank gold mine , and me@@ li@@ ad@@ ine gold project ( agnico eagle mines l@@ td . ) .

as minister responsible for the workers &quot; safety and compensation commission in nunavut , i ask my colleagues to join me in wishing all com@@ peti@@ tors , especially those representing nunavut , good luck in their events .

mr. enook ( interpretation ) : good afternoon to the people of pond inlet and our fellow nunavummiut .
mr. speaker , i rise today to make a brief statement .
mr. speaker , later today at the appropriate time i will be tabling a copy of the petition that has been signed by a significant number of inuit residents of nunavut communities , including many of my own constituents in pond inlet , calling for the establishment of a new north baffin inuit organization .
mr. speaker , although this petition is not directed towards the government itself , i believe that it is important for all members of the legislative assembly to be aware of the concerns and frustr@@ ations that have been expressed by a significant number of inuit in north baffin communities .
mr. speaker , when you and other members review the petition with care , you will note that the pe@@ titi@@ oners have expressed concerns regarding such matters as the management of inuit @-@ owned lands and the sharing of benefits from major development projects with those communities most affected by them .
mr. speaker , these issues will ultimately be resolved by the inuit of this region .
however , i believe that it is important for all of us to be clearly aware of these issues and i am glad to have had the opportunity to draw the attention of the house to them .

good afternoon , colleagues , nunavummiut , community of gjoa haven , and my friends and family watching .
thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to speak about the importance of volunteers to our communities .
mr. speaker , i spoke this week about the excellent work that a number of my constituents in gjoa haven are doing to improve housing in the community .
in my community many individuals volunteer on a monthly , week@@ ly , and even daily basis to make gjoa haven a better place for all of its residents .
mr. speaker , like most communities , gjoa haven &apos;s firefighters are mostly volunteers , as are the people who also risk their lives when a search and rescue operation becomes necessary .
mr. speaker , other residents volunteer their time in schools , at spor@@ ting events , and in a thousand other ways that do not necessarily attract recognition .
mr. speaker , i believe that our government can and should support volunte@@ er@@ ism in nunavut wherever possible .
i ask all members to join me today in paying tribute to the volunteers of nunavut .

( interpretation ends ) thank you , mr. speaker . i rise today to address an issue that is faced by many of my constituents as well as many young athletes from across nunavut : the lack of funds and the lack of support for training .
mr. speaker , we say that we want our youth to be healthy . this is also important for our family members and all of our community . promoting physical activity and a healthy lifestyle ensures that our youth will be in the best shape to become our future leaders .
mr. speaker , i believe more could be done to help our youth to stay fit and healthy and to improve their fit@@ ness by training for sports and being involved in spor@@ ting activities .

it is important that our government ensures that adequate support is provided to encourage our youth in their sport activities .
at the appropriate time i will have questions on this issue .

the reason i rise today is due to my initial feelings of des@@ pon@@ dency , but my heart seems to be filling with happ@@ iness because inuit qaujimajatuqangit is under discussion , as it is fundamental .
it &apos;s also a very serious issue here in nunavut .
mr. speaker , nowadays the common ref@@ rain we hear is that our youth require support .
let &apos;s put words into action by providing a better foundation .
this issue that i keep reiter@@ ating has love as its basis .
this is based on true love .
with that being the case , i want my colleagues to understand the reason for my enthusi@@ as@@ m on this subject .
it is only with the commitment of all residents and people of nunavut and all mlas here that challenges , especially with pe@@ tty crimin@@ ality issues , will be resolved by providing a very strong foundation based on inuit qaujimajatuqangit . only by using this foundation will corrections be made to our social ills .
following the grand@@ fa@@ thered legislation from the nwt has resulted in cultural de@@ gra@@ dation today and it is not geared towards inuit home@@ lands .
this is why i am trying with all i must to work towards seeing this realized where the promises under the nunavut agreement are implemented , both through government and the in@@ corporation of inuit traditions .
we must also stop beli@@ tt@@ ling our own culture and we must take pride in it .
progress is possible . since this is the case , i have spoken on many occasions about incorporating the strengths of inuit culture into our territorial legislation .
let it be taught since , as an elder and having practi@@ sed the traditional lifestyle ... .
mr. speaker , i seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
the member for quttiktuq is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement . are there any nays ?
there are none .
mr. shooyook , please proceed .
mr. shooyook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . i appreciate my colleagues for providing this opportunity to complete my statement .
as i was saying , because of the importance of this issue , it is critical to begin this today .
if we keep putting it aside , we will be too late .
that would be unfortunate .
when nunavut was created , we were informed , much like those watching us today , and what we believed was that eventually things would evol@@ ve towards inuit culture .
inuit were told to take pride in their lands and that eventually inuit culture would do@@ min@@ ate the territory .
to date , with many original witnesses no longer with us today , they passed on still having expectations of this .
this still hasn &apos;t been implemented fully .
mr. speaker , where can we start to begin creating solutions and to whom do we direct our concerns to , to incorporate inuit traditional knowledge ? where will we start ?
when i asked this government , i received hol@@ low words from the ministers voi@@ cing full support for my statements .
initially i believed them , but in looking back over these four years , i see nothing tangible .
this is very regre@@ t@@ table and when i have the opportunity , i will en@@ quir@@ e about this matter .
thank you , mr. speaker .

we take great pride in our graduates and some of us are en@@ vi@@ ous of their accomplishments as they now have choices as to what further studies they may want to pursue .
grade 12 isn &apos;t the ending but rather the start of one &apos;s life choices and further education .

thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to acknowledge and express my appreciation for those hunting families who share their catch with others on a regular basis .
mr. speaker , recently constituents of mine shared some pre@@ cious seal meat with my family .
i don &apos;t know how this worked out , but she actually wal@@ ked in the house and i had no idea that she was coming in today and i was going to do this member &apos;s statement . i would like to thank mi@@ ch@@ eline kilabuk c@@ ô@@ te . i also understand it &apos;s her birthday today , so happy birthday , mi@@ ch@@ eline .
&gt; &gt; applause
my family in pangnirtung also sent us some seal meat and i just want to take this opportunity to thank people for their kind g@@ es@@ tures . it was greatly appreciated .
mr. speaker , the sharing of food happens all across nunavut on a daily basis .
it is a deep @-@ roo@@ ted activity and one of the many aspects of inuit culture that is so impres@@ sive , so effective in strengthening society , and so demonstr@@ ative of great kin@@ d@@ ness and caring for others .
mr. speaker , as you know well , hunting is a great challenge . many hunters struggle to keep up with the cost of equipment , fuel , and am@@ muni@@ tion . in addition , today &apos;s hunters need to keep aware of new dangers that appear in the environment as a result of ongoing changes to our arctic climate .
our hunters today must constantly learn new ways to g@@ au@@ ge the safety of their activities and their surro@@ un@@ dings .
mr. speaker , hunting will always be a part of inuit culture . the re@@ wards of the hunt are not just in the bo@@ un@@ ty that is harvested but in sharing experiences with our families , learning skills from family members , celebrating first cat@@ ches , preparing skins , sewing gar@@ ments from those skins , and of course sharing the catch with others .
mr. speaker , i seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement today .

ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you to my colleagues for allowing me to continue .
mr. speaker , these activities bring families and communities closer together , making us strong and resi@@ li@@ ent by supporting each other .
mr. speaker , we need to encourage and support hunting across nunavut . we need to support our hunters financially and with the tools that will make them safe and successful out on the land and on the water .
mr. speaker , it is important that our children continue to learn the ways of hunting , about the changing environment , and about the importance of contributing to our families and our communities .
mr. speaker , i wish to recognize and applaud the many families who keep up the tradition of hunting and the sharing of their catch .
it is your contribution and your kin@@ d@@ ness and thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful@@ ness which help to create and maintain a strong community .

good day to the people of nunavut and pangnirtung , as well as my children and grandchildren in pangnirtung .
thank you for this opportunity today and i will speak to ... . i apologize . let me start by welcoming the visitors in the gallery to the house .
today i will speak to the local economic development initiatives in pangnirtung through the local hto board and its members .
the pangnirtung hto is very active and is also part owner of the fishery alliance in this region , specifically the ( interpretation ends ) baffin fisheries coalition and cumberland sound fisheries l@@ td . , ( interpretation ) where they are one of the instrumental bodies providing opportunities .
when they have been involved , they have created seasonal jobs and support for various community infrastructure projects , as well as food security and provision of country food .
what i will announce today is that the pangnirtung hto and board have completed another project . they completed their new office building within pangnirtung .
it is finished , with two sto@@ re@@ ys and a total of 16 brand @-@ new offices .
due to the size of this office building , which is 3,@@ 600 square feet , it is quite sp@@ ac@@ i@@ ous . it houses a conference room , kitch@@ en , wash@@ rooms , and built @-@ in phone jac@@ ks and internet lin@@ ks .
this building also has two entr@@ ances .
the total price of the construction project was $ 1.4 million .
the office building will require tenants . currently two offices have been identified for some workers for the hto .
this is a cause for celebration for the residents of pangnirtung , as local economic development comes from initiatives begun locally .
that is the main purpose of the building . i take immen@@ se grati@@ fication in the fact that the community is focused on creating self @-@ suf@@ ficiency through local initiatives by meeting some of the demand for office space . thank you , mr. speaker .

return to oral question 7@@ 76 - 4 ( 3 ) : funding for community arena upgrades ( savikataaq )
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
a return to an oral question asked by mr. qirngnuq , asked of hon. joe savikataaq , no. 7@@ 76 - 4 ( 3 ) , date asked tuesday , june 6 , 2017 , and the subject was funding for community arena upgrades .
question :
as the minister will recall , on february 29 , 2016 he and his federal counterparts jointly announced that more than $ 19 million in federal and territorial funding would be made available for &quot; upgrading community arenas &quot; in nunavut under the federal small communities fund .
during our recent winter sitting , my colleague , the member for aivilik , asked a number of questions concerning this funding .
in his response the minister indicated that his department was conducting an assessment of community arenas at that time to determine which arenas would be upgraded .
first question :
can the minister update the house today on the status of the assessment ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
first answer :
there are 10 community arenas without concrete flo@@ ors that require assessments .
three arenas have been identified and assessments of these will be completed by the fall of 2017 . the three arenas identified are gjoa haven , chesterfield inlet , and arctic bay .
question 2 :
&quot; can the minister indicate if his department has conducted site visits to determine this information ? &quot;
facility assessments were completed by cg &amp; s staff for each of the 10 arenas to assess the condition of the arenas that require upgrades . these assessments were completed from condition reports on file ( asset plann@@ er ) .
on @-@ site investigation and geo@@ technical assessments for the three identified communities will take place this summer of 2017 .
third one :
will the minister commit to formally announcing a list of recipient arenas that will be upgraded through the funding once the final decisions have been made ?
the answer :
gjoa haven , arctic bay , and chesterfield inlet will have the design in 2017 and construction tendered and completed between 2018 and 2020 .
the seven remaining arenas that currently do not have concrete pa@@ ds with ther@@ mo@@ si@@ ph@@ ons are baker lake , cape dorset , clyde river , hall beach , kimmirut , kugaaruk , and naujaat and they will under@@ go design , tender , and construction between 2019 and 20@@ 24 .

item 6 : oral questions
question 7@@ 90 - 4 ( 3 ) : need for inuktitut daycare in baker lake ( mikkungwak )
mr. mikkungwak : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ) i would like to direct my question to the minister of education .
mr. speaker , the community of baker lake is growing . the need for daycare spaces is growing .
the department of education &apos;s policy has always been to include space for a daycare in any new school it buil@@ ds .
however , the new school project for baker lake was removed from the government &apos;s capital plan .
can the minister clarify what assistance his department can provide to the community of baker lake in its efforts to establish a new daycare ?
thank you very much , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of education , mr. paul quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank the member for asking about that matter , as our children require adequate daycare space wherever they are in nunavut .
i want to explain to my colleague that i just sent a letter to rich@@ ard aksa@@ w@@ ne@@ e , the vice @-@ chair of the local dea in baker lake , tack@@ ling that issue .
i also informed him that our department can provide support and are open to doing that .
however , i also identified other matters since we know that baker lake only has one daycare .
after reviewing the circumstances as they stood in the community , we were made aware that 20 spaces are for pre@@ school@@ ers rang@@ ing from ages 2 to 6 .
with that information , we also noted a waiting list and we can only inform them that space is available for all the children on the waiting list when the daycare opens in august .
additional space will also be available .
this is what i was briefed on , so i wanted further information on this file .
further , as we know , in order to determine if a daycare will have adequate space or not depends on finding out further details . as per my earlier comments , the dea was sent a letter responding to their request and we are entirely open to working with them .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak ( interpretation ) : mr. speaker , i recognize that delivering inuktitut language early childhood education is part@@ ly the responsibility of the district education authorities .
however , that responsibility falls under the current education act , which is also the minister &apos;s responsibility .
can the minister clarify what steps are being taken to ensure that inuit language early childhood education programs are being delivered in nunavut &apos;s communities ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of education , mr. quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank my colleague for requesting further details on this issue .
i am quite ec@@ stati@@ c to announce , if our colleagues remember , last year we recently set up a resource centre specifically for the early childhood education program within a portable ta@@ b@@ let written entirely in inuktitut , program@@ med for learning to speak in the language . the i@@ pa@@ ds have had this program installed and all daycares have been sent one to work on learning to speak inuktitut specific to daycares that can be used everywhere .
this was our latest venture where we created that program .
as well , ( interpretation ends ) early childhood workers ( interpretation ) are the ones who would receive the training , as we can make them available and we have provided training in the past through arctic college . further , it is emphasi@@ zed that inuktitut must be the found@@ ational language and we are trying to ensure that it is delivered as inuktitut is the mother ton@@ gue and requires promotion .
what i can state here is that our department has tried to under@@ s@@ core the fact that we are open to ai@@ ding the daycares through various programs , especially related to these primary inuktitut speaking lessons . these are available and all daycares should have their ta@@ b@@ let being shipped to them , as all daycares that are open were sent a version .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak ( interpretation ) : mr. speaker , the community of baker lake needs support and assistance in setting up an inuktitut language daycare .
will the minister commit to providing the necessary supports and assistance so that desperately needed daycare spaces can be provided in the community of baker lake ?
thank you very much , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of education , hon. paul quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
related to baker lake , as per my prior remarks , i have written a letter on that issue to the dea where@@ in i also provided advice for determining the exact number of people on the daycare waiting list , as i am not fully aware of the exact situation in baker lake .
perhaps what i did ask for was the exact number of the daycare spaces and people on the waiting list to determine how many children who require daycare services would not have room .
as well , if we are going to open a new daycare or a daycare anywhere in nunavut , the current daycare , even as a single operation , may be impacted .
these are the types of details i had asked for from the dea board after i wrote to the vice @-@ chair .
the inuktitut language has to be used in our communities within nunavut due to the fact that these daycares are instrumental and we support them . when they ask for assistance for inuktitut programming or other resources , the dea can request it .
we now have staff dedicated entirely to this category and this position was created two years ago . we have provided further resources through this position and we use this position as our liaison .
further , deas can work with their regional worker to deal with issues specific to their community on the early childhood education program .
yes , we fully support the use of the inuktitut language , which is very important to us .

question 7@@ 91 - 4 ( 3 ) : contracting processes ( enook )
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) my questions are for the minister of community and government services .
the department of community and government services issues notices of award following tender and rfp processes .
as the minister is aware , the government &apos;s new nni policy came into effect on april 1 , 2017 .
can the minister confirm if all notices of award that have been issued by the department of community and government services since april 1 , 2017 have provided clear information to un@@ successful bid@@ ders and proponents regarding their right to submit a challenge to the new nni tribunal ?
( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
let me just elaborate a little bit on the member &apos;s question on the old nni and the new nni policy .
any contract that was dealt with before march 31 , even if it &apos;s for after april 1 , 2017 , would have been old nni , if it was dealt with and awarded before march 31 , &#91; 2017 &#93; because the new nni is effective april 1 , 2017 .
any contracts that are dealt with the evaluation process after april 1 would be the new nni .
as for the appeal process , i would think that all of these companies know that they can appeal because even in the old nni policy , they were capable of appe@@ aling .
it &apos;s just a different system now , but under the old nni and the new nni they both have the right to appeal the decisions .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) in cases where an un@@ successful bid@@ der or proponent has submitted a challenge to the nni tribunal regarding a contract award , does the department of community and government services su@@ spend the final contract award until the tribunal has ren@@ dered its decision in the matter ?
( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
the nni secretariat deals with nni matters , but to the member &apos;s point , each case is different and it would be jud@@ ged on its merit .
the procurement department would get a legal opinion from justice and then that would determine whether they go ahead or not .
in some cases , if it &apos;s a big contract and it means dela@@ ying that project for a year , there are pretty huge consequences for that .
each contract would be jud@@ ged on its own merit and the cause , and that would be after an opinion from justice .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker . ( interpretation ends ) section 9.1 of the new nni policy provides that the nni tribunal shall , and i quote , &quot; be established to hear and decide on complaints regarding the application of the nni &#91; policy &#93; in the award of any contracts covered by the nni &#91; policy &#93; ... the tribunal shall not review any aspect of a procurement process other than the application of the nni &#91; policy &#93; . &quot;
my question for the minister is : in cases where an un@@ successful bid@@ der or proponent has broader concerns about a contract award that go beyond the application of the nni policy , what appeal rights do they have ?
( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of community and government services , hon. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
if someone doesn &apos;t like the process , they can appeal it to the procurement department and if they &apos;re still un@@ satisfied , then these proponents have legal options that they can exercise .
everyone who dis@@ agrees with anything , whether it is procurement or someone &apos;s comments , all have legal choices they can make . in the end , if there are people who are not satisfied with the outcome , if they so choose , they can go through the legal route .

mr. speaker , in my member &apos;s statement today i spoke about the importance of encouraging volunte@@ er@@ ism in nunavut .
as i noted , i think that the government has a role to play .
article 2@@ 1.@@ 02 of the government &apos;s current collective agreement with the nunavut employees union provides that , and i quote , &quot; an employee ... may be granted leave with or without pay for a period of up to a maximum of fifteen ( 15 ) days per fiscal year to do public service work which is in the interest of the employer or nunavut . &quot;
mr. speaker , participation in firefigh@@ ting and search and rescue training and missions is covered by this provision .

mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker .
good afternoon to the people of sanikiluaq .
mr. speaker , my questions today are for the minister of community and government services .
mr. speaker , during the summer of 2016 sanikiluaq experienced increased so@@ di@@ um levels in its drinking water .
as the minister will recall , i asked him a number of questions regarding sanikiluaq &apos;s water supply during the fall sitting last year .
in his response the minister indicated that his department was , at that time , conducting an analysis of the situation .
can the minister tell us what the results of that analysis were and can he clarify what factors led to the high levels of so@@ di@@ um in sanikiluaq &apos;s drinking water last summer ?
thank you , mr. speaker .

hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
the analysis was done and yes , the so@@ di@@ um is high , but we can &apos;t figure out why the so@@ di@@ um is high .
to date we have not figured that out . we just know that it is and we have put in the ro@@ s and looking at other options .
all i can tell the member is that no , we do not know why the so@@ di@@ um levels increased in their water supply .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. rumbolt .
mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker .
given the number of issues with sanikiluaq &apos;s water last summer , residents in the community are concerned about the ongoing vi@@ ability of sanikiluaq &apos;s current water source .
can the minister tell me what options his department is currently considering as an alternative water source for sanikiluaq ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
we are looking at another water source . the member would be more familiar with this lake as i have not been to sanikiluaq . the lake is called win@@ dy lake .
it &apos;s approximately nine or ten kilo@@ metres away from town . we &apos;re going to do studies for the che@@ mi@@ cal analysis of the water , the bi@@ o@@ me@@ tri@@ cs of the water , and the re@@ charge rate of the water . that is one of the lakes that we are looking at for an alternative water source .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. rumbolt .
mr. rumbolt : thank you , mr. speaker .
i am aware of the lake that he &apos;s talking about . it &apos;s also known as win@@ dy lake and it &apos;s my understanding that there may be issues with the water coming from that lake as well .
i would like to know what options sanikiluaq will have if the need for a new water source arises and there is no water source close enough to the community .
it is my understanding that a new method of water treatment is being employed in arviat , for example .
whatever the decision , i hope that a permanent solution to sanikiluaq &apos;s water wo@@ es can be implemented soon .
can the minister tell us today : when will a decision regarding a permanent solution to the water issues in sanikiluaq be made ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of community and government services , mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
the water situation in sanikiluaq is unique in terms of its so@@ di@@ um .
it &apos;s not any organi@@ c matter in the water or any fil@@ tr@@ ation problem . it &apos;s because the so@@ di@@ um level is high , so it &apos;s unique and will have to be dealt that way .
we are designing a water treatment system right now to be designed this year to go sanikiluaq .
i can &apos;t tell the member exactly what &apos;s en@@ tail@@ ed in what the design will have , but people have to have safe drinking water .
we are going to look at solutions for sanikiluaq . we want the people of sanikiluaq to be able to drink the water that comes out of the ta@@ p without rever@@ se os@@ mo@@ sis .
all i can tell the member is we don &apos;t have a definite plan of exactly what we will do , but we do have a plan that we will give them safe drinking water in the future .

( interpretation ) mr. speaker , in my member &apos;s statement i spoke of the need to support our youth to stay healthy . our athletes need adequate funding to be able to train and to be able to attend competitions .
can the minister provide an update on what specific kinds of funding are provided by his department to community groups to support youth participating in activities to stay in shape ?

hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. program .
sorry ...
&gt; &gt; laughter
... mr. speaker .
there are many programs that we do have in each community , but the major ones that people recognize the most and that get the most amount of funding are that happen when the time comes .
for instance , we fund the arctic winter games . it &apos;s a major expense that we have because it has a whole lot of athletes from nunavut that participate .
we have the inuit summer games . we fund those too . we fund any teams or participants that are going to the canada summer games or the north american indigenous games .
those are the major ones that we fund .
each community does get funding through sport nunavut to fund certain programs and they can talk to the people from sport nunavut to ask .
if they &apos;re not sure what funding is available , pick up the phone and ask .
thank you , mr. speaker .

it is important that our youth are able to keep physically active and train on a regular basis .
it is also important for them to participate in competitions . we as community members also like to see our youth competing and representing our territory .
can the minister provide an update on what specific kinds of funding are provided by his department to support youth to travel to attend competitions in other regions or jurisdictions ?
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister of community and government services , mr. savikataaq .

as i stated earlier , what we call the major games , we fund athletes to go there ; the arctic winter games .
we fund inuit summer games and we usually send if there are any teams or athletes going to the canada summer games or the north american indigenous games .
we give parti@@ al funding for regional hockey tournaments and stuff like that . there is an application process for it . i &apos;m not sure exactly what they fund , but if you &apos;re not sure , put an application in and it will be deemed whether it fits the criteria to get the funding or not .
we want people of nunavut to be in shape and fit because people are hap@@ pi@@ er and healthier when they &apos;re in shape .

( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , in march of this year the assembly provided over $ 3.5 million for the sport and recreation administration division under the department of community and government services .
will the minister indicate how much of this funding will be provided at the community level to support our athletes in the near future ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of community and government services , mr. joe savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t have that level of detail with me , but i know that all the communities get funding . we also fund regional things like we fund volleyball association types , soccer types , and hockey . we fund many different things in communities .
i can &apos;t tell him how much each community gets because some of these programs are applicant @-@ case funding , which means there is a pot of money and people apply to get that pot of money for whatever sports that their community or region is interested in .
i can &apos;t answer that question other than there is a pot of money .
if you &apos;re not sure , just get in contact with sport nunavut and they will guide you through all the ho@@ ops to get funding if the funding criteria fit what you want to do .

my questions are for the minister responsible for the nunavut business credit corporation .
both the nunavut business credit corporation &apos;s board of directors and the standing committee of this legislative assembly which held televised hearings on the nbcc &apos;s annual reports have supported the recommendation to amend section 37 of the nunavut business credit corporation &apos;s enab@@ ling legislation to increase its maximum loan limit from $ 1.@@ 0 million to $ 2.0 million .

some of the expectations to the nunavut business credit corporation , of course , include the comprehensive report of all the procurement , contracting and leasing activities undertaken by the nbcc .
other things are asking them to look into the sectors across nunavut as well as other ventures that could possibly happen .
some of the ideas i heard from the board are that they want to have an economic type meeting amongst the boards , such as the nbcc , the bb@@ dc , and atuqtuarvik to get together to discuss what possibilities can be done for nunavummiut .

mr. shooyook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
today is our last sitting for the spring , so my questions are for the premier .
i have expressed many frustr@@ ations about the slow pace of integr@@ ating inuit qaujimajatuqangit across the government , especially in the areas of family counselling and services .
the inuit qaujimajatuqangit katimajiit was established to provide advice to government about how to integrate inuit qaujimajatuqangit into its laws and policies .
can the premier provide me with some examples of how the territorial government of nunavut has been actually listening to the advice provided by the inuit qaujimajatuqangit katimajiit ?

speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. premier of nunavut , hon. premier taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the member for asking about that matter .
mr. speaker , when the government is reviewing bills for en@@ ac@@ tment , they refer to this committee he mentioned . we meet with the representatives to develop ideas on how to incorporate inuit qaujimajatuqangit into legislation and that is the process .
sometimes the committee provides advice to the government , for example , on the requests while other times bodies such as nunavut tunngavik incorporated are our partners in working on the draft legislation .
with respect to article 32 , we are aware of the ( interpretation ends ) nunavut land claims agreement ( interpretation ) and the various provisions of article 32 . when we are working on draft legislation as a government , this is how we try to incorporate inuit qaujimajatuqangit principles by meeting with this committee . it is debated and sometimes a different outcome from the meeting results in changing draft legislation to ensure that inuit don &apos;t en@@ dur@@ e hardships due to the in@@ ability to adhere to it .
it is hard to review every law as we can only change a few pieces of legislation as a government .
thank you , mr. chairman .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . your first supplementary , mr. shooyook .
mr. shooyook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the premier for his hard work in trying to implement part of my expectations for this government and i am proud of his efforts .
i believe that it is also important for the federal government to respect inuit qaujimajatuqangit when it is making laws and policies that affect inuit in nunavut .
does the premier raise this issue when he is meeting with the prime minister or other federal officials on nunavut &apos;s behalf ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
premier of nunavut , mr. taptuna .
hon. peter taptuna ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
absolutely . i would like to thank the member for asking about that issue .
yes , whenever we hold meetings or whenever i meet with the prime minister of canada , i speak about that matter , and we do have a process for discussing that .
as inuit , our culture is foreign to the law@@ makers . ( interpretation ends ) indigenous and northern affairs canada ( interpretation ) is where we also explain what our culture is when meeting with the minister responsible .
i maintain that when we try to practise our lifestyles and culture traditionally , we run into trouble with the law because legislation in canada is designed for sou@@ thern@@ ers and a different culture . we have a culture different from our law@@ makers . when i am meeting and discussing northern issues with them , this is what we try to voice .
this includes discussions on the future as our own lands change due to climate change and we want to be involved due to our experience in facing that daily in our cultural practices .
most of us were born on the land and here we sit .
meetings are held with our provincial counterparts or the federal government on future impacts like with provinces such as british columbia or other provinces . whenever the leaders of the northern territories of the nwt and yukon along with nunavut meet , either to respond to the prime minister or other leaders that the north is experiencing the biggest change , our goal is to be able to make our own decisions now and in the future . we maintain that position .
although we do talk about the fact that we are a part of canada and should not be forgotten , the federal government is starting to learn that we want to be self @-@ determining in planning for our future while incorporating our culture .

prior to upcoming elections , the government prepar@@ es a priority pl@@ at@@ form for each department , what was being worked on , and what else needs work , for example , my office at eia .
this would include a written report and the issues requiring further work , either for the government or for the department .
with the den@@ es@@ ul@@ ine file , over@@ la@@ p work has been performed , including many other files .

the introduction of learning coaches will likely have had an impact on how the education system has been delivered in nunavut &apos;s communities .
can the minister describe how his department has been evaluating the effectiveness of learning coach positions in nunavut &apos;s schools ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of education , hon. paul quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , they help a great deal in our school , quite obviously .
the main reason for creating them is to see how we can strengthen literacy in our schools .
the learning coaches are more like assistants to the teachers than anything else .
we have also heard that the learning coaches are very helpful in the schools because we all know teachers need to be able to teach different discipl@@ ines like math or reading and different subjects like that .
the main purpose for the learning coaches is to help the teachers strengthen literacy .
they help our teachers a great deal in nunavut .

i looked into this issue this morning , but the office of the fire marshal in rankin inlet has not completed their final report yet and that &apos;s why i cannot respond to the member &apos;s question at his time . we will have to get the final report from the office of the fire marshal before i can provide any further information .

as i indicated earlier , we are waiting for the final report from the fire marshal , which will be provided after the investigation has been completed .
we will take steps on rep@@ air@@ ing those units .
once we have the opportunity , we will assess the unit to determine what resources we will need to make that unit available .
it &apos;s pretty heavily damaged , but it can be renovated to be occupied again .
if there are no materials in rankin inlet , we would have to consider ordering and decide whether we &apos;re going to be contracting out for the renovation or if we will do it locally .
if there is a need to order materials , we will have to wait for the annual sealift to arrive in rankin inlet , but we hope to have it completed within a year .

question 8@@ 01 - 4 ( 3 ) : expansion of martha talir@@ uq centre ( mikkungwak )
mr. mikkungwak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of health .
mr. speaker , on april 1 , 2017 the department of health took over responsibility from the department of family services for providing support and resources for three elders facilities which are operated by independent societies , including the martha talir@@ uq centre in baker lake .
can the minister provide an update on the transition of these responsibilities from the department of family services to his department and tell us what the next steps will be ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of health , mr. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
when those three facilities were transferred over april 1 to the department of health , it was the final step in taking over responsibility .
that being said , from the report that led to the determination that that would be a more efficient and effective way for making sure people can age in a place appropriately , for providing a continu@@ um of care for our elders across the territory , making sure that our policies are ali@@ gned to make sure that we &apos;re providing the full service to nunavut elders , those &quot; measu@@ ra@@ bles &quot; are still going to be analy@@ zed on an ongoing basis .
as far as taking over responsibilities for the facilities , it was completed april 1 .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your final supplementary , mr. mikkungwak .
mr. mikkungwak : mr. speaker , the martha talir@@ uq elders centre accommo@@ dates a number of elders and unfortunately the need for additional spaces is growing .
can the minister indicate how his department evalu@@ ates the space , services , and level of care for elders at such facilities as the martha talir@@ uq centre ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of health , hon. george hickes .
hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
when the department of health and social services was de@@ vol@@ ved into two separate departments , department of health and department of family services , with that division came a division of some of the infrastructure or responsibilities for elders .
by coordinating that responsibility back together again , it took a little bit of work to make sure that there was an actual team of professionals that were tasked with making sure that the transition would be smooth , just as it was back when through the separ@@ ation of the departments , making sure that there was , again , a task force then on separ@@ ating the responsibilities .
it did take a period of time to make sure that there would be a continu@@ um of services .
that being said , part of that evaluation , there were health care professionals from the department of health , including the clinical side of things , coordinated with cgs , who do facility evaluations or checks of infrastructure across the territory .
from the clinical side we sent over part of our team , continuing care , to make sure that the facility was able to be able to meet the needs on the level of care that was expected to be delivered , and to make sure that the residents there are in an appropriate facility for one .
there was and is a lot of work into basically making sure that we have that continu@@ um of care for elders .
it was ongoing by health care professionals , including the clini@@ cians , to make sure that the level of care was appropriate to the residents .
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. mikkungwak : mr. speaker , i have visited with the elders at the martha talir@@ uq centre and some of them have indicated to me that they find it a bit clau@@ stro@@ pho@@ bi@@ c at the centre .

question 8@@ 02 - 4 ( 3 ) : inuit curriculum lost ( okalik )
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
yesterday i tabled a document on the funding provided for curriculum development and as i was reading the blues , i noted the member for south baffin asked the minister of education about the ma@@ ke@@ up of the inuktitut curriculum .
part of the response indicated that previous work was lost , so i ask the minister if he had a review done .
where is the work put together by elders that were designed as pa@@ th@@ ways to learning for inuit ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you . ( interpretation ends ) the hon. minister of education , hon. paul quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i also thank my colleague for that question about the curriculum that was developed back then . in relation to the older curriculum work , i had a review done on that previous work .
mind you it was back in 2003 @-@ 04 . it is slightly over 20 years now that , i believe , is the subject here .
the initial attempts to create inuktitut curriculum back in the initial days are still in use today .
further , during the work to create the work as part of this review , it was specific to the higher grades .
for example , ( interpretation ends ) junior and secondary years , ( interpretation ) so i mean those grades when i say higher grades .
further , curriculum work isn &apos;t just incorporated into school curri@@ cul@@ a and if any person makes lessons , then you can learn immediately as that is not the case in our schools .
instead it has to follow the stre@@ ams approved .
because of that , i want to first thank those who initiated this work back in the day and the work created previously for the curriculum to be used in the schools .
it didn &apos;t follow the guidelines for learning within the schools and required additional work prior to being introduced into the curriculum .
as per my previous statement , some curri@@ cul@@ a are still used .
nonetheless , some of the material has been stored now , but there are many examples of written materials that were created .
i just received correspondence from a@@ y@@ a@@ ya communications today that 250 pieces of materials were in their files from the previous work done .
the 250 files currently held by a@@ y@@ a@@ ya are being incorporated into the curriculum and they are a resource to us when we start to develop curriculum .
i just want to repeat , for example , that we are quite sele@@ ctive in our choices as we prefer pieces that are well laid out which can be used in our schools and produced in inuktitut , english , or french .
that &apos;s the information in regard to the 2003 @-@ 04 school curri@@ cul@@ a that were produced at that time . i am sure he re@@ members that as he was the premier when they were produced .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
your first supplementary , mr. okalik .
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i would also like to thank the minister for finding the curriculum that was developed in the past .
nevertheless , some of the material is very applicable to what we are trying to incorporate , al@@ be@@ it much of it isn &apos;t used today . however , they can lay the foundation culturally and they can also be used today .
even if these created works won &apos;t be incorporated into the curriculum , they should not just be shel@@ ved but be used in another avenue outside of the school system , perhaps in other departments of this government .
i wonder if they can be made available as it cost money to develop them and the government owns the rights and they are book@@ ed for storage .
i want to ask the minister again to reconsider it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of education , mr. quassa .
hon. paul quassa ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
indeed , this is what we want to see with material designed for our schools .
yes , there are various types of materials created and this process will continue as we receive new material every year .
further , the materials , ir@@ respective of when they were developed , obviously will become used . as per my earlier comments , this work is still underway to date .
it has taken quite a while to develop a comprehensive set and the different materials from 2003 to date as more materials are under development for school curriculum , particularly those for inuktitut classes .
yes , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to be .
we will utilize the written materials that we can develop . i want to let all of my fellow members know that we &apos;re developing the curriculum . as i stated earlier , there are over 300 inuit language materials that are being used in our schools .
i know that we will continue to develop those reading materials for the schools . i thank those individuals who develop the curriculum material in the past so that they can be used for our schools .

question 8@@ 03 - 4 ( 3 ) : activities of the climate change secretariat ( angnakak )
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
my questions are for the minister of environment .
as the minister will recall , in november of last year he announced the creation of the climate change secretariat , which is now responsible for managing climate change adaptation and mitiga@@ tion programs and policies for the government of nunavut .
during that time the minister also stated that the climate change secretariat would ab@@ sor@@ b the positions and responsibilities of the previously named energy secretariat .
can the minister describe what specific work the climate change secretariat has completed , including any new programs or policies that it may have been developed , since its creation ?

hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
this is a very new secretariat and it takes a while to set up when you ab@@ sor@@ b two different secretari@@ ats , i guess .
we &apos;re still in the process of filling the positions . some had no bodies in the person and some were filled by casuals .
all i can tell the member is that we &apos;re still trying to build up the secretariat . we &apos;re just trying to set up shop .
to the best of my knowledge , we have not developed any new policies yet other than the existing policies that were already in place .
we &apos;re just setting up shop .

on june 8 , 2017 the minister of economic development and transportation tabled the comprehensive report on the activities and expenditures of the energy secretariat , 2015 @-@ 16 .
this report provided updates on a number of ongoing projects , related costs , and future plans of the energy secretariat .
will the minister commit his department to completing a similar report on the activities of the climate change secretariat covering the 2016 @-@ 17 fiscal year ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of environment , mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;ll go back to the first question . some of the projects that were done and we can talk about it some more , but some of the things they have done is they have incorporated climate change into the nunavut environmental assessment process .
they put on climate change adaptation courses and that is ongoing . that course is to government departments so that they can plan for either if the permafrost is more active or less of it .
that &apos;s what that course is about . they have done some permafrost ma@@ pping in communities , where communities should build and places where they are recommended not to build .
the list goes on here and i can share it with the member rather than going on .
these are projects that are ongoing and were already on before the secretariat came up . the capabilities of the secretariat will be enhanced now that it has gone from , i believe , it was four positions to seven or three to four . i can &apos;t remember the exact numbers , but total positions are four .
they have meetings with the federal government . there are all kinds of funding available now for climate change and we are doing our best to ta@@ p into those funds .

your final supplementary , ms. angnakak .
ms. angnakak : thank you , mr. speaker .
i didn &apos;t hear a commitment for completing a similar report on the activities of the climate change secretariat .
i &apos;m sure he will agree to that . i &apos;ll go on to my next question . in his answer , his response , thank you very much .
it leads into my third question .
in that report the energy secretariat indicated that &quot; information gathered from previous energy audits will be analy@@ zed and may be used to study the feasibility of a targeted energy efficiency incentive program . &quot;
mr. speaker , the government currently does not provide any incentives or programs in support of homeowners and businesses who may wish to use renewable energy or energy @-@ efficient technology .
can the minister tell us if the government is currently exploring the feasibility of introducing any such incentives in nunavut ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minister of environment , mr. savikataaq .
hon. joe savikataaq : thank you , mr. speaker .
the qec introduced a net me@@ tering program and i &apos;m not aware if it &apos;s rolled out yet , but that would be one incentive where homeowners could subsidize or supplement their power bill through renewable energy once that program is up and running and in@@ ta@@ ct .
we &apos;re not looking at any programs right now if homeowners want to buy so@@ lar panels or wind generators or other renewable energy @-@ producing devices .
once the net me@@ tering is fully functional , the government may want to look at that , but currently we don &apos;t offer any incentives to buy renewal energy products for the homeowner .
i &apos;m not aware if there are any funds available from the federal government , but there might be .
as to the member , currently , no , we &apos;re not doing that right now .

my question is to the minister of health .
last week i had some questions in regard to patients wanting to stay longer just to do some sho@@ pping .
in his response he said that they would have to find their own place if they wanted to do that .

hon. george hickes : thank you , mr. speaker .
medical travel organized 26,000 medical travel trips last year . has there been an occasion where somebody stayed an extra day or two in the larga ?
i can &apos;t answer that .
there are any numbers of reasons why people can be forced to stay ; there are mechanical delays and flight delays .
there are times , i know for a fact , that people just haven &apos;t been quite up to travelling the day after a procedure is done . we send people home at the earliest available time .
to me , for somebody to stay down in a government @-@ paid boarding home to go sho@@ pping , i &apos;m not aware of any situations like that . that &apos;s all i can give the member information on today .

mr. okalik .
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman . ( interpretation ends ) i want to follow up on the line of questioning that my colleague for tununiq was asking in relation to cheque processing .
we have quite a few number of communities that have government employees , for example , and where there are no banking services offered at this time .
we know that these stores and out@@ lets that charge fees take a risk in processing cheques , but when it comes to government of canada cheques , they aren &apos;t allowed to charge fees .
they &apos;re not going to be taking a risk by cas@@ hing a government of nunavut cheque from what i understand .
can the department or the minister ask that these fees be wai@@ ved as these cheques won &apos;t bo@@ un@@ ce and they will likely spend the money in the store where it &apos;s being cas@@ hed , for example ?
can the department reconsider this piece of legislation in relation to cas@@ hing government cheques ?

hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you .
good afternoon .
i am very happy to appear before you today to introduce bill 29 , an act to amend the motor vehicles act .
( interpretation ends ) bill 29 meets a long @-@ standing and strategic objective of the government . it reflects sivumut abluqta &apos;s commitment to healthy families and communities by putting safety at the heart of the proposed amendments .
this bill will change the name of the act to the traffic safety act .
in addition , it updates nunavut &apos;s legislation and ali@@ g@@ ns it with other canadian jurisdictions while respecting nunavut &apos;s environment and the interests of our communities and residents .
besides a few consequ@@ ential amendments , the act has not been amended since before division from the nwt .
nunavut needs an act that reflects current realities and impro@@ ves safety for all nunavummiut , whether they are drivers , passengers , or pe@@ des@@ tri@@ ans .
we all rely on our roads and road safety affects us all .
we also need to ensure that nunavut meets its commitment under national agreements to ensure continued reci@@ proc@@ ity with other jurisdictions .
reci@@ proc@@ ity in this case means the ability for a licensed driver from nunavut to be recognized in another province or territory . ( interpretation ) mr. chairman , this is important to nunavummiut who want to drive a c@@ ar outside the territory , whether it &apos;s renting a c@@ ar in winnipeg or youth enro@@ lling in training programs in the south .
these basic activities are only possible because our licence continues to be recognized outside of nunavut .
( interpretation ends ) the need for updated legislation is clear in light of the rate of traffic incidents and inju@@ ries in nunavut . according to statistics compiled by transport canada using accident data gathered in nunavut by the rcmp , our rates of f@@ ata@@ li@@ ties and inju@@ ries are much higher than the canadian average on most measures .
nunavut @-@ wide consultations were held during the winter and spring of 2015 @-@ 16 .
this included a we@@ b @-@ based survey , targeted interviews with organizations like the nunavut association of municipal administrators , inuit organizations , and the rcmp .
we listened closely to nunavummiut and nunavut organizations when developing the amendments in the proposed bill .
we heard clearly that while nunavummiut were generally supportive of the proposed graduated licensing system , they were concerned that no one should suffer un@@ reasonable delays in moving through the licensing process , particularly in smaller communities .
as a result , the bill was changed to enable government liaison officers to carry out written exams . this will allow exam@@ iners to spend more time on road tests .
in addition , i am personally committed to ensuring that before any graduated driver &apos;s licence regulations come into force , the government ensures that it has the resources in place to provide equal access to licensing services for all nunavummiut .
as i have said , the key objective of this bill is to improve driver , passeng@@ er and pe@@ des@@ tri@@ an safety . this will be achieved by delivering the following key amendments :
increasing penalties for imp@@ aired driving , including up to 90 @-@ day ro@@ ad@@ side suspen@@ sions for repeat offenders , and zero blood @-@ alcohol limits for no@@ vice drivers ;
a prohi@@ bition against dis@@ tra@@ cted driving , specifically the use of hand @-@ held electronic devices ; and
a regulation @-@ making power allowing for the introduction of a graduated driving licensing system to support new driver safety through additional testing prior to obtaining a full licence .
in addition to these changes &#91; which &#93; have a primary focus on safety , we propose other amendments to provide additional protection for nunavummiut , for example , by licensing motor vehicle deal@@ ers operating in nunavut and requiring deal@@ ers to provide a used vehicle information package when selling a second @-@ hand vehicle .
i am confident that this act meets the interests of the territory and will improve driver , passeng@@ er and pe@@ des@@ tri@@ an safety on nunavut roads .
i welcome the deliberations on this bill and look forward to the opportunity to explain its provisions in greater detail . ( interpretation ) thank you .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much . ( interpretation ends ) does the chair of the standing committee have opening comments ?
mr. t. sammurtok .
mr. tom sammurtok : thank you , mr. chairman .
as chair of the standing committee on legislation , i am pleased to make opening comments as the committee of the whole begins its consideration of bill 29 , an act to amend the motor vehicles act .
as members will recall , bill 29 received second reading on november 8 , 2016 and was referred to the standing committee on legislation for consideration .
the standing committee supports the intent of the bill , which the minister has described in her own opening comments .
i am pleased to note that the standing committee and the minister have undertaken a productive dialogue concerning bill 29 .
mr. chairman , during the minister &apos;s recent appearance before the standing committee on the occasion of its clause @-@ by @-@ clause consideration of bill 29 , a total of 12 motions were moved to amend the bill , all of which received ministerial con@@ currence .
in addition to a number of technical amendments , bill 29 was also amended to address a number of concerns regarding the safe@@ gu@@ arding of personal information in respect to information @-@ sharing agreements entered into by the government .
the standing committee was pleased to receive a commitment from the minister that the forms used by nunavummiut who are applying for driver &apos;s licences and general identification cards will be reviewed in this area .
the standing committee was also pleased to have received a formal commitment from the minister that she will introduce a short , stand @-@ alone bill during the upcoming final sitting of the current legislative assembly to provide for statutory reporting requirements under the legislation .
as members are aware , the parliament of canada is presently considering proposed legislation to lega@@ li@@ ze cann@@ ab@@ is in this country .
another theme that emerg@@ ed during the standing committee &apos;s deliberations was the need for the territorial government to be prepared to introduce further amendments to the motor vehicles act to address the issue of drug @-@ imp@@ aired driving in nunavut .
the standing committee also urges the government to be mind@@ ful of the practical realities of small communities when it is developing regulations to implement the new graduated driver &apos;s licence system .
the standing committee also looks forward to the introduction of comprehensive amendments to the all @-@ terrain vehicles act during the next legislative assembly .
mr. chairman , i anticipate that one motion will be moved during today &apos;s proceedings regarding the coming into force dates for bill 29 .
mr. chairman , that concludes my opening comments . the standing committee recommends the passage of bill 29 , as amended and rep@@ rin@@ ted , to all members .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman : thank you .
the floor is now open for general comments . ( interpretation ) please raise your hand so that i can recognize you .
mr. okalik .
mr. okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman . i would like to welcome the minister and her officials .
when we were dealing with the draft bill , i was grateful to her department for the way they drafted the legislation , as we are behind in some ways , such as handicapped par@@ king lots .
i was pleased to see their inclusion in this bill .
i was also pleased to see the provisions related to the res@@ ale of used vehicles within nunavut , especially vehicles that are on the point of breakdown , as this has led to many concerns amongst residents .
to see it remedi@@ ed is something they should prepare for as it requires a vehi@@ cul@@ ar history , as well as its condition rating prior to sale .
i am very pleased about these sections for improvement , especially imp@@ aired driving penalties that are more severe within this bill . i would like to thank the minister and her department . it will be of great benefit to nunavummiut once the amendments are in force .
i wanted to start with those comments , mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
i didn &apos;t really hear a question in the member &apos;s comments .
however , to provide more details on some of the matters , yes , it will provide a lot of improvements , especially for our handicapped drivers or those who have handicapped passengers , although this amendment should have been added earlier as it wasn &apos;t included .
this includes additional provisions related to winter haz@@ ards and such things as snow banks and snow buil@@ d@@ up around inter@@ sections .
now i expect in the future that this will improve the daily operational challenges , for example , that may in@@ tru@@ de on people &apos;s lives , so it will benefit drivers .
as well , what the member mentioned partially was related to drivers with hand @-@ held devices resulting in dis@@ tra@@ cted driving . these are some of the issues asked about , as drivers must keep their eyes on the road at all times and not be dis@@ tra@@ cted by other things while driving . this includes trying to text while driving .
this can completely result in acci@@ dents and it will be included in the new legislation .
it is one of the additions i take great pleasure seeing within the legislation , as it is now referenced in the sections related to hand @-@ held devices or other devices used today , such as no@@ te@@ books or tou@@ ch@@ pa@@ ds .
it will be prohibited and outlined in the bill .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
following my list of names , mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
good afternoon , madam minister and your officials , and my ataata@@ kuluk .
i will be asking for clarification because not all nunavummiut know the contents of this legislation .
we can have some sections of the bill clarified .
we have been working on this bill , including by correspondence and in committee to try and reach a mu@@ tual understanding .
one of the minister &apos;s letters states that her department is looking at the possibility of alternative service delivery agents , which i &apos;m not sure how to say it in inuktitut , for the purpose of appointing additional exam@@ iners to administer the graduated driver &apos;s licence system in nunavut .
can the minister clarify what she means by alternative service delivery agents ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
regarding the alternative service delivery agents , if an individual wants to try to get a driver &apos;s licence , they have to do a written test first before they get a learn@@ er &apos;s permit .
at this time it &apos;s usually the rcmp and by @-@ law officers that deliver the written tests .
it has been considered through this legislation to review the possibility of using alternative service delivery agents such as glos , who can take on that responsibility .
the government liaison officers can deliver this service . if we need to identify other delivery agents , we can do so .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
on page 2 , the minister stated that &quot; as a result , the bill was changed to enable government liaison officers to carry out written exam@@ in@@ ations .
this will allow exam@@ iners to spend more time on road tests . &quot;
at this time , when a road test is required , who does the testing ? is it the rcmp officers or others who administer the road tests ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
if a road test is required , the rcmp officers do the testing .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
i &apos;m going to ask two questions at the same time as i want to move on .
the rcmp officers conduct the driving test . the testing would not change ?
my second question is in regard to some of your correspondence which states that the government plans to introduce a graduated driver &apos;s licence system in nunavut . the letter indicates that the department intends to ce@@ ase the ro@@ ut@@ ine practi@@ sing of issuing driver &apos;s licences restricted to nunavut .
i would like to ask about anyone who doesn &apos;t mind having a restricted nunavut driver &apos;s licence . i believe that if some of us tried to drive down south , it would be very dangerous for others and ourselves .
if i wanted to retain a restricted nunavut driver &apos;s licence , would i have that opportunity ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
i believe i heard three questions , so i &apos;ll try to respond to them . i was trying to listen to him closely .
mr. chairman , with his last question , people who have a restricted driver &apos;s licence can only drive in nunavut .
even though we &apos;re going to switch to a graduated driver &apos;s license system , those who have a restricted nunavut driver &apos;s licence can remain at that level .
if they don &apos;t want to graduate to another driver &apos;s licence level , they can remain at that level . they will have that option .
the member also asked if the rcmp would be conducting the road test .
the rcmp officers want to move away from taking on that responsibility in nunavut .
we &apos;re now working with them on how we can deliver the service for road tests so that we can manage the road testing system properly because the rcmp would like to move away from that responsibility in the future .
i can &apos;t remember his other question .
is that sufficient ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
let me get back to the other question .
as you had stated , madam minister , individuals who want to have a restricted nunavut driver &apos;s licence can retain their driver &apos;s licence .
some time in the future after this legislation has been enfor@@ ced , if a first @-@ time driver wants to get a driver &apos;s licence , will their licence be graduated so that they can drive anywhere in canada ?
will they have an opportunity to keep their restricted licence in nunavut or will that be ph@@ ased out ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman . i also thank the member for asking about that .
although the restricted nunavut driver &apos;s licence will no longer be used in the future , those who already have a restricted driver &apos;s licence can keep them .
with the new legislation we will introduce a graduated driver &apos;s licence system in nunavut with three levels .
i can say that even if they don &apos;t want to drive down south , they can keep their middle level driver &apos;s licence . individuals who don &apos;t want to graduate to another level , they can retain the level that they &apos;re at .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
i am sure nunavummiut can understand that .
i will move on to another topic .
in some of your correspondence on this bill ...
&gt; &gt; power ou@@ tage at 17 : 34
&gt; &gt; committee resumed at 17 : 59
chairman : i call the committee meeting back to order . ( interpretation ) we will continue with ( interpretation ends ) bill 29 , an act to amend the motor vehicles act .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
i still have some questions .
as we were dealing with bill 29 , i understood that vehicle traffic at mine sites is not affected by the bill or the motor vehicles act . that is how i understand it . the act is not enfor@@ ced at those locations .
it should be noted that the mining companies enforce their own safety programs .
my question is : to what extent is the government evaluating the effectiveness of mining companies &quot; safety programs ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
i also thank the member for that question .
if the roads that lead to mine sites can be used by anyone , for instance , if they are public access , then the legislation would apply to the mining companies .
in response to his second question , heavy equipment will have to be registered through our office so that they can be inspected for safety .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
let me ask a question about what i know .
for example , there are mines at mary river and mil@@ ne inlet . there are many vehicles in both of those locations , one at the mine and one at the inlet .
do they have to register their vehicles with your department or not ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
if they are going to be used on public roads , they have to be registered .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you .
moving on to a different topic , there are different provisions in the motor vehicles act , such as imp@@ aired driving regulations .
the regulations under the motor vehicles act have not been updated for many years , including the brea@@ th@@ aly@@ z@@ er regulations .
when will you update the regulations under the act ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
these are under the federal legislation , so i can &apos;t say when they will be updated .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you .
along the same line , the rcmp administers the brea@@ th@@ aly@@ z@@ er test .
if we are going to pass this legislation today , it includes provisions for that .
are you satisfied that the rcmp has adequate and up @-@ to @-@ date brea@@ th@@ aly@@ z@@ er equipment in all 25 communities ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell @-@ kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
if a community didn &apos;t have brea@@ th@@ aly@@ z@@ er equipment , the officer sto@@ pping the driver can get their blood tested at the health centre .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. enook .
mr. enook ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
i want to be clear and all nunavummiut to be clear that we can be taken to the health centre ... .
for example , if the rcmp sto@@ ps someone who they think is under the influence , if they don &apos;t have a brea@@ th@@ aly@@ z@@ er or if it is unti@@ mely , let &apos;s say , four o &apos;clock in the morning , they would have to w@@ ake a nurse to go to the health centre , even though it &apos;s only a su@@ spi@@ ci@@ on and they &apos;re not under the influence . a nurse would have to be aw@@ ak@@ ened if they don &apos;t have a brea@@ th@@ aly@@ z@@ er . the nurse would have to get up and go to the health centre because they have to a blood test .
is that how it would be set up ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
yes , if they didn &apos;t have the equipment in the community , then that would be the case .
the rcmp would do the standard tests like walking and imp@@ air@@ ment testing . they would do that first .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. qirngnuq .
mr. qirngnuq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
i would first like to welcome the minister and her officials .
i would like to ask about your opening comments on page 1 , fourth paragraph .
it states , ... &quot; impro@@ ves safety for all nunavummiut , whether they are drivers , passengers , or pe@@ des@@ tri@@ ans . &quot;
thinking about that , i don &apos;t know whether the drivers are imp@@ aired by drugs or not .
thinking about it , there are different types of drugs .
some medi@@ cations are power@@ ful and can cause imp@@ air@@ ment .
if the legislation pas@@ ses , will the drugs that i just mentioned be included in the provisions ? i hope i am clear .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
i &apos;m not sure of the terminology in inuktitut , so i will answer in english . ( interpretation ends ) only for controlled substances .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. qirngnuq .
mr. qirngnuq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
if that is the case , it probably wouldn &apos;t be a surprise in the community as far as it applies to roads .
i have a second question on the bill .
in english it &apos;s &quot; vehicle . &quot;
it will be changed to &quot; motor vehicle . &quot;
i think that &apos;s the case , if i understand it properly .
we will probably see in the regulations &quot; motor vehicle , &quot; as long as it has a motor in it .
if i understand it correctly , the hon@@ d@@ as and ski @-@ do@@ os are used a lot in the smaller communities . will the regulations also apply to those types of vehicles ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
the amendments include if they are driving on a public road . if a four @-@ wheel@@ er , which is called an all @-@ terrain vehicle , is driven on public roads while the driver is imp@@ aired , they would also be dealt with under the act .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
mr. qirngnuq .
mr. qirngnuq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
this will be my last question .
i &apos;ll ask a question about the regulations .
i don &apos;t see anything in the documents here about a vehicle with whe@@ els , such as a c@@ ar or an at@@ v , or a snowmobile and if there is an age limit . we will probably see that in the regulations . i hope i &apos;m clear .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
ms. ell @-@ kanayuk .
hon. monica ell kanayuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. chairman .
i didn &apos;t see the light .
if they &apos;re going to drive on what &apos;s called municipal roads or city roads that are public roads , either a motor vehicle or an at@@ v , they would need a driver &apos;s licence or a learn@@ er &apos;s permit .
they would have to be 15 years of age or older .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) : thank you very much .
