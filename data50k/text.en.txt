remarks by speaker
speaker mr barnabas
honourable members mr prime minister madame commissioner madame minister distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen welcome
please allow me to begin by expressing my deep appreciation for the trust and confidence that you have placed in me by selecting me as your speaker
as speaker it is my responsibility to serve this assembly in the spirit of impartiality and fairness
for this assembly to truly serve the people of nunavut its elected representatives must know in this house and within its rules they have the freedoms and privileges that come with the heavy responsibilities placed upon them
i pledge to you that i am mindful of my duty to ensure that the rights of the house and its members are upheld our work starts today
as we perform our duties in this house its committees and in our constituencies we know that the eyes of those who elected us to our positions of trust are upon us
as the youngest of canada s legislatures much is expected of us
this legislature is only one of two in all of canada that does not operate on a partisan basis
rather the spirit of consensus guides us the best decisions are those that are achieved through dialogue
civility and respect are among the qualities that shall characterize this place consensus can build accountability
this house will succeed when those who make the choices that affect the lives of our families and the communities know that their actions are subject to the scrutiny of the assembly as a whole
together we will find the path - a path that is lit brightly by the fact that the composition of this assembly reflects the diversity of nunavut itself
some of us come from the assembly of our new western neighbour and we are grateful for the support of our former colleagues and constant friends
we look forward to the benefits of the wisdom and experience that members who served in the west bring with them their contribution will be matched by the ideas and perspectives of new members
the people of nunavut expect us to learn listen and act i am confident that the honourable members will work to do so - a pledge we all took just hours ago when we took our oaths
on may 25 1993 in this very room the nunavut land claims agreement was signed many of the people who were there on that day are also with us this afternoon
we thank the students of inuksuk high school for once again sharing their place of learning
we look to the energy of our youth and the wisdom of our elders to inspire us in the years ahead
i would like to take a moment to recognize the elders and youth that are with us today
elders from all of nunavut s communities are represented at this gathering - we thank them for their years of effort in achieving this day
the pages that you see come from the 19 constituencies of nunavut many of them are travelling away from home for the first time
krista eric kenny nina tommy genevieve gloria rachel jonathan jayne solomon stacey johnny itidloi jesse lorna kipanik edward qujjuk teevi fauna and jennifer - we are very proud of you
we are also honoured to have with us in the room today the honourable premier of the northwest territories mr jim antoine and former premier nellie cournoyea
i believe that you will all agree that the artwork which surrounds us is beautiful
the wall hangings that you see were made by the quqshuun ilihakvik centre in gjoa haven the tusanik school in repulse bay and the inuujaq school in arctic bay
on behalf of the legislative assembly and the government of nunavut i would like to express our deep appreciation for the beautiful painting that you see in front of the stage
it was presented last evening by the honourable jonathan motzfeldt premier of greenland to the honourable paul okalik
these symbols like the qamutik that rests on the floor will find a home in our new assembly building
i would finally like to recognize the artists who created the mace
we are honoured that they are with us today
inuk charlie joseph suqslaq paul malliki mariano aupilardjuk mathew nuqingaq and sam pitsiulak - thank you
the mace which will shortly be presented to the house is itself a reflection of the rights and authority of a democratically elected assembly
it is a gift from the qikiqtaaluk corporation and seven other inuit organizations
it speaks eloquently for itself in the way it embodies the soul of our land this assembly and our people
thank you

item 5
commissioner s address
commissioner maksagak
elders mr speaker your excellencies honoured guests members of the legislature i am pleased to welcome you to the opening of the first session of the first assembly of nunavut
this is a great honour for me to give the first commissioner s address on behalf of our new government
i would like to congratulate you mr speaker the premier-elect the cabinet and all of the members of this assembly on being called to form the first government of nunavut
the people of nunavut have put their trust in this assembly to work together in the creation of a new government in a new territory
they have elected you because they believe and trust in your will and ability to carry this work forward
our elders here today and listening to this speech on radio and on television can tell us how far we have come
they remember the times from their own lives and from the histories of their parents when inuit were alone in this land
as inuit we built our lives from what was around us
from snow and bone from the animals of the land and the sea our elders fed and cared for their families
they accomplished everything with little
they travelled thousands of miles at home in their environment and taught the next generations the strength and ingenuity to carry inuit into the modern world
the modern world is now here
as inuit we share nunavut with others who have come to join us
english and french speaking canadians people from many lands have become part of inuit communities
new tools have been introduced to our land and inuit have taken those tools and made them our own
snow and bone have turned to metal and paper
together with our new neighbours we have established towns built schools and airports negotiated a land claim and now we see the creation of a new territory
nunavut is ours but ours to share
there is work to be done everywhere
our government plans to develop a budget over the coming months and will introduce it this spring to this assembly
our government will work to deliver services and programs to the people of nunavut in a sensitive responsive and responsible manner
our government also asks for your patience and your goodwill
not everything will work the first time not every office will be staffed
there will be some delays and false starts
this is our government we built it we own it we now have the responsibility to make it work
tell us when things go astray and we will work with you to make them right
our government will develop a legislative agenda for presentation to this assembly
this will begin our journey towards creating nunavut solutions laws policies and programs
in continuing this journey we commit to listening to the people of nunavut and continuing to be guided by the people s needs
mr speaker this is a day of ceremony and celebration
it is appropriate that our government is introducing today the flag act which will designate the official flag of nunavut
i am confident that the people of nunavut will be proud to see this symbol of our new territory flying in all our communities
thanks are due to more people in more ways than words can express
to the peoples of canada and their governments in each province and territory who have supported nunavut over the years
we thank you with all our hearts and we are proud to join you
to the peoples of the northwest territories as we leave them for having travelled so far with us and for having been companions on our journey
we thank you and wish you safe journey as our paths part
to our elders who first dreamed to our leaders and negotiators who first spoke the dream to our children who have taken the dream into their hearts and lives
we owe you everything and we will work to earn the trust we have been given
today we join hands with you in the birth of nunavut
speaker
thank you madame commissioner
now i would like to invite the hon jane stewart minister of indian affairs and northern development to address this assembly
ms stewart
item 6
presentation by the hon jane stewart mp minister of indian affairs and northern development
hon jane stewart min indian affairs and northern development
mr speaker it is indeed an honour to be present at the first sitting of the new territory of nunavut
respected elders commissioner and prime minister i join your voices in congratulating the premier-elect the members of cabinet and the members of the legislature on their achievement to date
mr speaker i congratulate you as well on your selection and i listened to your advice to your colleagues in your introduction
i don t expect that you will have the beautiful voices of the youth here to guide you but certainly it will be the youth and their future that will guide your decisions
you will be supported by the elders and by the symbols that are in your legislative assembly that remind you of who you are from whence you come and the significance of your responsibilities
for years the people of the eastern arctic have dreamed of a territory they could call their own
and while it has not been easy individuals organizations and government have long worked side by side with vision and determination to make the dream a reality
today we are celebrating the fruits of our labours nunavut
this realization was carried out by the residents of nunavut for the people of nunavut
recall the northwest territories of 1870 a vast expanse of land by any measure east to west north to south
already home to aboriginal people it was soon the land of opportunity for newcomers
a territory diverse in both population and geography
responding to this diversity canada has redrawn its map over time
today out of the still vast northwest territories canadians have created yet another territory that reflects our democratic vision
that territory is nunavut our land
this evolution goes to the heart of what makes the canadian federation strong government s ability to grow in lockstep with the aspirations of her people
as other nations around the world struggle to define themselves often with great human cost we count ourselves very lucky
ours is not a history of war and conflict it is one which is inspired by co-operation by balance
we have built a strong country in which we are masters of our own destinies
with nunavut canadians have once again taken the opportunity to make choices about their future
those elders gathered here today have never doubted that it was the right choice
and through their decades of hard work towards this moment they never doubted that if you can dream it you can do it
as nunavut takes its place in the canadian federation it will be tested
you know as do i that expectations are very very high
you must create jobs improve health keep youth in school
the government of nunavut you will be called upon to do all this and much much more
but i believe this is a territory and a people that are ready and up to the challenge
of course we can t predict exactly what the future will bring but i am convinced it holds tremendous promise for the people of nunavut and canada as a whole
in fact across the north in nunavut the northwest territories and the yukon there is exciting economic social and political change underway
change that brings northerners the tools and control they need to build strong self-sufficient economies and communities and an even brighter future
just as the path of progress led us west in the twentieth century so the path of opportunity leads us north in the twenty-first
the government of canada is proud to have been a partner in this important undertaking
the creation of nunavut
thank you to all those whose commitment has brought about the birth of nunavut
congratulations to you the political leaders and to the people of nunavut
thank you and best wishes
speaker
on behalf of the assembly i would like to thank you for your remarks
the chair will now entertain nominations to adopt the premier and executive council
mr hunter tootoo honourable member for iqaluit centre
item 7

mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker
whereas section 55 1 of the legislative assembly and executive council act requires that there shall be an executive council of nunavut

item 8
premier s address
mr okalik
respected elders mr speaker those who have visited mr prime minister minister stewart madame commissioner please feel welcome in nunavut
as all of the nunavut residents i am very proud of this moment and in having been selected as the first premier for nunavut
i wish to thank the members of the legislative assembly for their support and encouragement in my selection as premier
in the past two weeks i have enjoyed working with the cabinet and the regular members
we have already dealt with a number of issues and i look forward to working with you for a productive five years in our future
as you all know we had a long hard journey towards nunavut
there was a lot of hard work but we have reached the end of the journey and it feels like we have completed a lot of work
the inuit of nunavut have settled the largest land claim in canadian history
when we look at the canadian map we have reshaped that map today
those are very symbolic gestures and they are a very big part of being a new territory of nunavut
for those who have been elected to positions and have created a government based on the principles of human rights there are a lot of outside people who have admired what we have done
we would like to create a government that is founded on integrity and openness that is one we can be proud of
on this journey in trying to get nunavut there were troubles many have fallen
there were a lot of very special people who could not be here to celebrate with us today
some of us have lost family members to suicide and some have lost relatives to the land as they were out harvesting the resources trying to live the life of our forefathers
some of us have known those who fell victim to abuse and aggression
but it has always given me strength because we have to look to the future while respecting and remembering those who we lost who are here today and watching us
in respect of those dear people i would like to ask for a minute of silence to remember those who did not reach this day
i would ask for a moment of silence
>> moment of silence observed
thank you
today the eyes of the world are upon us and as well the eyes of nunavut are upon us and watching
our ancestors are also watching us
they look to us the people of nunavut
in their eyes there is hope and expectation that we will succeed and as the premier i will have a lot of responsibilities and i know i will have to work very hard
i do not take that lightly i accept that responsibility and i will continue to place first and foremost the people of nunavut because that is part of my job
we are going to have a government that has many responsibilities and that cannot be taken lightly
the people from kugluktuk to broughton island from sanikiluaq to grise fiord will have to help us
all of the nunavut residents will have to work hard for our future has to be well planned in order for us to succeed
i have gone to every corner of nunavut and i know that in the future i am confident we will accomplish a better future
to date i have seen a lot of strength and character in my fellow inuit and those who are willing committed and determined to work
we have to demonstrate that we can deal with the problems our society faces because we are the only ones that can fix them
our children especially because they are watching we have to prove ourselves to them and stand out as better role models
i pledge to you the people of nunavut that the government of nunavut will work to ensure that there are the right conditions to assist you in making change
we will make it possible for you to rise up and get an education
we will make it possible for your families to move forward
we will make it possible for our communities to grow in a healthy way
we will put conditions in place for you to make nunavut strong again
to the people of nunavut nakurmiik qujannamiik matna koana thank you and merci
in closing i would like to echo comments by my colleague ovide alakannuark we are no longer dreaming
this is reality
we have arrived
--applause
speaker
i would like to thank the members of the legislative assembly of nunavut and thank the premier for his words
i would like to ask the prime minister mr jean chretien to address the assembly
item 9
address by the right honourable jean chretien p c mp prime minister of canada --applause
right hon jean chretien prime minister of canada
mr speaker on behalf of the people of canada i am honoured by your invitation to address the first ever meeting of the legislative assembly of nunavut
i would like to offer my congratulations for your election
compared to the election of the speaker in the house of commons in 1993 that took almost a full day it was done pretty rapidly here and i would like to congratulate you
i want to congratulate the premier for having won the confidence of his colleagues here during the recent election
i would like to tell him that it took me thirty years to become prime minister and you became premier in two weeks
--laughter/applause
i would like to tell you that it is a great privilege to serve as leader
it is both a serious responsibility and an incredible opportunity to shape the direction of a government and build the future of a people
each and every member of this honourable assembly deserves equal praise and recognition
you will go down in history as the first government of nunavut
in you the people of nunavut have invested their faith and trust
an investment that is never made lightly but never more so than when a people take their first steps into a whole new future
i never lost sight of that basic truth about elected office through thirty six years of public life
governing is very different from the business of getting elected
i learned that lesson soon after i arrived on parliament hill
the trail of a victory is quickly replaced by the awesome amount of work that must be done
as nunavut takes flight you are dealing with immense challenges
whether it is educating your fast growing population alleviating poverty and social breakdown or building the capacity within your own government to address these challenges you have your work cut out for you
work that will require patience creativity and tremendous energy to resolve
fortunately the people of nunavut are blessed with these qualities in abundance
your new premier and cabinet are fine cases in point
you have the added advantage of being able to draw the best from both worlds
traditional inuit teachings and values that have passed down through the ages and a modern government structure with access to state of the art technologies
unlike in years past the north of today is no longer hostage to geography and climate
it is very much a part of the wired world with equal access to the opportunities for growth and development that it presents
i have no doubt that you will find the solutions that you seek
that you will build on these strengths focus your agenda on what can be achieved and set your sights on what matters the most to your people
i want to assure you of the government of canada s commitment to being an active partner in your work and ensuring a new passage to the new millennium
i also want to remind you that your contributions to canadian society will extend beyond the boundaries of the new territory
your insights and ideas will be welcome as we address national priorities
your unique northern perspectives and your consensus approach will be valuable as governments throughout canada work together for the common good
just as the qulliq has served as a beacon of hope and illumination of your people your presence on the national scene will shed new light on how we can build a better country
nunavut is an acknowledgement that there is strength in diversity
that government works best when it is closest to the people that we will only move forward as a nation when we all move forward together
indeed among my proudest achievements as minister of indian affairs and northern development was helping create the first fully elected legislature in the northwest territories a milestone on the road to nunavut
it was great days in some ways when i was naming the members until i named one and he decided to vote against my instructions
so i decided it was better to have everybody elected
i have high hopes and expectations of the men and women in this auditorium
i am confident that by building on your rich inuit heritage remaining true to the people who elected you and embracing the support and encouragement of all canadians nunavut will be a great success
i look forward to watching your nunavut dream become a reality in the days and years ahead and i will look for your inukshuk as you lead the way
good luck congratulations and a happy nunavut day
long live canada long live nunavut
--applause
speaker
on behalf of the assembly i would like to thank the prime minister of canada for being with us on this most historic day and for his gracious remarks

appreciation and acknowledgement of educators
hon james arvaluk interpretation
mr speaker it gives me great pleasure to stand in our legislative assembly to pay tribute to all educators across nunavut
i would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts and considerable energies which educators across nunavut have brought to our early childhood programs and to our schools
we are fortunate to have dedicated and committed school staff who are working hard to lay a firm foundation for our children s education
their commitment to developing the critical skills processes and practices which will allow our children to lead successful and productive lives is the backbone of our school system
their appreciation of our children s language heritage and cultural identity is what makes our classrooms and schools welcoming and affirming places to learn and grow
it is a great pleasure to thank them for their hard work and also to encourage them to continue on with us as we build our new educational system in nunavut
we are fortunate to have exceptional educators who work as language specialists teachers student support assistants cultural instructors and school community counsellors
there are elders and community resource people who share their skill and wisdom
there are parent volunteers who support their children s learning and promote the school activities in the community
there are dedicated members of dea s who work diligently to ensure that the schools are meeting community goals and that teachers are supported in meeting those goals
these individuals are critical to the smooth operations of schools but they are also the important links that allow the school to reflect the community and the community to be represented in the school
i also want to acknowledge the role of educators which each of us has to play
our children s learning is the sum of all their experiences
as parents aunts uncles relatives and so on we all influence and have opportunities to enrich the learning and experiences of children in nunavut
i challenge you to take this responsibility seriously and to actively join us in making nunavut a network of community teachers and learners
through this kind of collaboration we ensure that our children can be the best they can be and we are all enriched by that
the nunavut teachers federation is holding their founding meeting this weekend
i would like to take this opportunity to wish them all the best
please help me acknowledge and show appreciation to our educators of nunavut for all the hard work commitment and groundwork they have done for education
let us stand an applaud them
thank you mr speaker

congratulations to labrador inuit on land claim
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
today i would also like to have the opportunity to congratulate the inuit of labrador on successfully reaching their land claims agreement
i know that this has been a long and hard struggle with very few resources
i recall back in the 1970 s when the late bill edmund struggled to get newfoundland to recognize the need to deal with the issue of aboriginal rights protection
if bill were still alive today he would be mighty proud of them
we are all proud of their perseverance believing in their own people and keeping their issues in historical perspective allowed them success on this historical day
there s much work ahead which will be just as difficult but the light at the end of the tunnel will give them energy and anticipation for a challenging and fulfilling trip
i m sure the people of nunavut will support them and assist them any way possible to reach their final destiny
once again on behalf of nunavut congratulations
thank you mr speaker

oral questions
speaker interpretation
oral questions mr iqaqrialu
question 6 - 1 2
inuktitut documentation
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker and to the ministers and all the members to the legislative assembly
i have a question to pose to all of you some of us members
speaker interpretation
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
thank you now i know better i will direct this question to the government leader of nunavut
for those of us who are inuktitut unilingual speaking members and cannot read and write english
i would like to ask the leader when the government will be giving out documents in english all the documents should be translated into inuktitut so that we can have a good input
i understand that is self-explanatory
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
although this is an oral question i would like mr havioyak to respond
hon donald havioyak interpretation
those documents that have not been translated some of them are being worked on and we personally are working on them at this time
i will make sure that these documents are translated before they are given to the members that speak only inuktitut
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
oral questions
mr irqittuq
question 7 - 1 2
high costs of transportation
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the cost of living is very expensive today because we have to transport the goods by airfreight
if i were to order one snowmobile from montreal to hall beach the freight would cost over $2000 00
or if you send goods by the post office it is very expensive too because it s almost twice as much to send something through the post office
mr speaker i would like to ask our premier if he will be looking into this issue
thank you
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
premier if you would like to respond it is totally up to your discretion
i think this question could be posed to a few ministers either to the minister responsible for transportation or mr ng
would you like to respond
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker mr speaker we know that our government does have several subsidies that we provide to our constituents
thank you
speaker interpretation

oral questions
mr puqiqnak
question 8 - 1 2
letter to minister on challenged constituent
mr puqiqnak
interpretation thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct this question to the minister of education
i wrote a letter to you mr minister i am sure you have received the letter i have sent you dated april 3
there was a person who died in my community on that date who had adopted
that person is an adult now twenty four years old deaf and mute
since he is deaf and mute i think he really missed his adoptive parents especially his father
he was acting differently after the father died
we spoke to the step-mother and we spoke to that person who is adopted as to how he or she wants to be educated
that person wants to go to school and he or she felt he or she would feel much better after leaving the community
i would like to ask the minister what his position is in regards to the letter i sent him
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation thank you before the minister replies i would like to elaborate that you don t have to make reasons for your questions you can ask your questions directly
minister arvaluk
hon james arvaluk

question 10 - 1 2
traditional curriculum
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to address this question to the minister of education
yes i really appreciate the fact that our children have a chance to go to school in academics
i was wondering what you are going to be doing about traditional education because there are many students up there who require traditional instruction
thank you
speaker
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
interpretation mr speaker his question i can answer his question and it would probably take all day to answer his question
the response would be quite lengthy perhaps if my friend can tell me what he is talking about in detail
are you talking about inuktitut curriculum traditional on the land or inuktitut language instruction
perhaps if you could be more specific
speaker
interpretation mr arvaluk thank you
could you rephrase your question mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i was thinking more when i said inuktitut curriculum of survival out on the land and how to go hunting and how you survive out on the land especially in winter time
also making traditional clothing such as caribou clothing
in the past we used to utilize the traditional clothing more but now it is not being used today and many young people are freezing to death so that s my question
mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr alakannuark
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
interpretation thank you mr speaker
we ve only been a government for just a little over forty days but we ve already been discussing how the previous government was within nunavut
i met with the baffin divisional board of education last night to discuss this matter or to discuss this issue
we are committed to working on curriculum that could reflect the inuit culture to utilize the inuit qaujimajatuqangit whether it be in school or whether it be technical
i am requesting support on inuit knowledge traditional knowledge to utilize these how you survive on the land but this will require a lot of preparation
usually the system was such that each community was making their own educational curriculum in the community themselves without consulting with the other communities
speaker
interpretation thank you mr arvaluk
do you still have questions mr alakannuark
no
mr kattuk member for hudson bay
question 11 - 1 2

thank you mr speaker
introduction
mr speaker i am honoured to present our first government of nunavut budget
this budget address along with the main estimates which i am tabling today provides our financial position and plans for our first fiscal year of operation which ends march 31 2000
across this country tradition has finance ministers delivering new budgets wearing new shoes
in establishing a nunavut tradition i am proud today to be wearing a pair of new caribou kamiks made by respected elder bessie omilgoetok of cambridge bay
mr speaker new kamiks a new budget a new beginning
this budget ensures the early success of our new territory
it also provides a strong foundation on which we can build our future
the needs of nunavummiut are great
our expectations are high
but like the journey taken by the founders of nunavut which led to the creation of our new territory the meeting of those needs and the realization of those expectations will take time
there is a great conviction on the part of all mlas to see that this happens in the least amount of time possible
government programs and services will be reshaped as quickly as possible to better meet the needs of the people
and to better meet the vision of nunavut
some changes to programs and services have been made already and are reflected in our budget
many other changes are in the planning stages and will be announced in the coming months
other more substantive reforms will require careful study and extensive public consultations
one option that does not exist is for us to fund new programs services and capital projects without regard to our fiscal means and circumstances
our fiscal plan
the government of nunavut is in the fortunate position of starting without an accumulated deficit or debt load
despite the attractiveness of borrowing money to finance current spending on needed government programs services and capital projects such actions would be short-sighted
we must avoid the problems faced by other governments
we are adopting a sound budgetary policy which will allow us to move towards improving the quality of life in nunavut
most governments including the federal government have large accumulated debt loads
the associated interest costs greatly reduce the amount of money that can be spent on health education and other important social programs
similar to other jurisdictions here in the north we have seen the impact of reductions in spending on our social programs
most governments in canada have experienced negative effects from financing current programs and services with borrowed money
interest costs on borrowed money soon outweigh any short-term benefits
we can and we will learn from their mistakes
we plan to stay debt free
mr speaker nunavut will have a balanced budget in the 1999-2000 fiscal year
our fiscal plan projects revenues of $610 million and expenditures of $600 million
we have a small 1 6 percent operating reserve to accommodate unforeseen expenditure increases or revenue declines
our projected expenditures do not exceed projected revenues
we do not plan to spend money we do not have
we are not allocating expenditures from a potential positive opening financial balance for nunavut at this time
the size of our opening balance will be determined when the division of assets and liabilities process with the government of the northwest territories is completed by october 1999
we currently do not know the final amount of this opening balance but we do know that many of the assets will not be cash
we also know that our opening balance will be reduced as a result of having to assume the financial obligations incurred by the office of the interim commissioner
our fiscal plan focuses on the strengthening of our revenue base and the management of our expenditures in a manner which best meets the needs of our citizens and the vision of nunavut
prospects for improving our revenues from our own economic base are limited in the short-term however future prospects are much brighter
our forecast of revenues from taxes and fees account for approximately 9 5 percent of our total revenues
we are projecting $57 million in own-source revenues this year
our largest source is personal income tax which we expect will bring in $16 million
other sources include tobacco tax payroll tax corporate income tax fuel tax property tax and school levies
mr speaker i am pleased to announce that there will be no new taxes or fees in this budget
nunavut given our vast area small population and lack of a developed economic base is very dependent upon federal fiscal transfers
they will comprise about 90 5 percent of our revenues for the 1999-2000 fiscal year
of the $553 million of revenues expected in federal transfers $499 million will come through the formula financing grant
the formula for this program is set for the first two years of the government of nunavut
the level of these transfers is influenced by national factors such as growth in provincial expenditures as well as by nunavut factors such as population and tax revenues
the current structure of the formula hinders the government of nunavut in benefiting from revenues of future economic activities in the territory
we will seek a better arrangement in the next negotiations
the formula financing grant was intended to allow for the delivery of the same level of services in nunavut as was provided in the area previously by the government of the northwest territories
it also made allowances for the additional headquarter costs in both territories
although the federal government provided transitional funding of $150 million additional funding for infrastructure social and cultural needs was not included in the formula financing grant
we will continue with efforts to have our additional needs addressed through the formula financing grant and through other federal transfers
we are hopeful that a stronger national economy and an improved federal fiscal position will allow room for positive federal responses
mr speaker independent of our success on the revenue side we plan to act in a responsible manner in our development of expenditures policies and our delivery of programs and services
being responsible means using our resources efficiently and effectively setting priorities making choices being innovative and being open to change
as well it means operating in a fiscally responsible manner and living within our means
we plan to reshape and manage government programs and services in a manner which best meets the needs of nunavummiut
the achievement of these objectives will require the input of all members of this legislative assembly
it will require the involvement and support of our other northern partners
it will require the dedication and commitment of our employees
above all it will require the wisdom of the people of nunavut particularly of our elders
stability in our programs and services
mr speaker the reshaping of government programs and services to best meet the needs of nunavut is a complex task
many reforms will take considerable time and energies
the continuity in the delivery of programs and services used daily by the people of nunavut is a major priority of the budget
to help ensure that all programs are delivered as cost-effectively as possible many headquarters and other administrative functions have been streamlined and will be delivered by central government departments
this includes information technology financial processing and human resources services
this approach to internal organization will enable program departments to focus on the provision of programs and services beneficial to the public
the budget allocates $545 million on government programs and services
an additional $55 million will be spent on capital projects throughout nunavut including nearly $20 million on social housing
the departments of health and social services education and community government housing and transportation account for over 60 percent of nunavut s spending on programs and services
the departments of public works telecommunications and technical services justice and sustainable development account for another 25 percent
mr speaker i will now highlight some of the departmental spending initiatives for this year
the department of finance and administration will continue the electrical power subsidy to ensure that all nunavut residents continue to have access to reasonable utility rates
this will cost $3 8 million
the department of justice will continue to provide $830 000 to support nunavut s 3 regional legal aid clinics
the department of community government housing and transportation will continue to provide assistance to hamlets in meeting their operational costs through the municipal operating assistance program
this program will contribute $18 7 million in this fiscal year
in addition $5 2 million will be provided to communities to help offset the high cost of water and sewage services to local residents
the department of culture language elders and youth will provide $1 8 million in grants to art councils and cultural organizations
the department of education will provide $72 4 million to territorial schools $13 6 million to nunavut arctic college plus $28 million for income support
it will also add 17 teaching positions across nunavut by reprofiling current expenditures
this will help the department to accommodate the increased number of students and maintain its present level of service
the department of health and social services will provide $44 4 million to support hospital insurance services in nunavut
as well it will contribute $4 9 million to community wellness programs
this department also will continue to support a broad range of children s programs including the children in care program and the early intervention program spending a total of $3 2 million this year
the department of sustainable development will provide $12 5 million in grants and contributions to a wide variety of associations and organizations
these contributions include
$1 3 million to nunavut tourism $1 0 million to the nunavut business development fund $1 8 million for community initiatives funding and $2 9 million to the nunavut development corporation
the capital program for 1999-2000 incorporates projects where contractual arrangements were in place by the gnwt
also included are projects having legal or regulatory requirements or involving health and safety concerns
social housing projects and projects supported by federal contributions insurance claims or other external funding sources were given priority
the use of these criteria allowed us to initiate a capital program in time to meet the 1999 construction season
in the coming months we will be starting a 5-year capital planning program which will involve extensive consultations with mlas along with communities
in addition to the capital program outlined in our budget there will be many other construction programs carried out this fiscal year
the government of canada will be providing $9 3 million in funding for water reservoir improvements sewer lagoon improvements and other capital projects
nunavut construction company ncc will continue a major office building and housing program in support of our decentralization plans throughout nunavut
in addition we are actively pursuing private-public partnering arrangements to provide much needed health and education facilities in our communities
by partnering with nunavut s business community we can develop local expertise and skills create employment and maximize the benefits from our resources while building our needed infrastructure
our budget provides a stable environment to plan for nunavut s future it allows us to begin addressing the challenges we face and the priorities of our people
our environment and challenges
there are major geographic demographic social and economic challenges that we have to contend with in order to improve the lives of nunavummiut
our territory encompasses almost one-quarter of the land mass of canada with a population of approximately 26 000 residents
our 28 communities are only accessible year round by air or by ship during the short summer season
our geography causes the cost of providing essential programs and services to be very expensive
an example of this is the $15 4 million we must use to provide transportation for our people to access health services not readily available in our communities
our population is growing three times faster than the canadian average 64 percent of our people are under the age of 30 and more than 45 percent are under 20
this creates ever increasing demands and pressures for health and education services as well as for housing and other social programs
in our largest social program education and health and social services we have started the process of reform
planning for efficiencies between departments and board administrations is a major step in that reform
we also know that recruitment and retention of staff in these important program areas needs to be addressed as a priority
both the honourable james arvaluk and the honourable ed picco are committed to dealing with these initiatives and the task of ongoing reform
we are looking at ways we might work with the federal government to address the shortage of new social housing
the cmhc funding we have in place will decrease over the next 20 years so finding new ways of dealing with this matter is crucial
the honourable jack anawak minister of community government transportation and housing has recently announced an extension of the minimum down payment assistance program
this program provides nunavut residents with a grant of up to $15 000 to use as a down payment to purchase an existing home
the availability of adequate and affordable housing to meet the needs of our growing population is one of our highest infrastructure priorities
the nunavut court of justice has been established
this is a single level of court that is unique in canada
along with this there will be increased support for justices of the peace so more cases can be dealt with by community members within their own communities
meeting our social challenges will require a commitment on the part of our government and the people of nunavut
we know that in nunavut we have an economy that is unique in canada one that affords great opportunity for development
our government holds that all our people should be able to participate fully in these economic development opportunities
nunavut has enormous natural resource development potential
last year the mineral exploration industry invested more than $70 million here
we are committed to improving employment opportunities across nunavut and we will continue to support economic activity that is based on our traditional way of life
later this session the honourable peter kilabuk minister of sustainable development will address in some detail the issue of the development of our economy
this budget provides additional financial support for a nunavut prospector program a nunavut arts and crafts association harvester support programs and community economic development
economic development depends in part on our ability to attract investment both private and public
the nunavut land claims agreement provides a stable economic environment in addition to our resource potential
as a result private investor confidence is strong
we must look to the federal government for a high level of partnership and commitment in our economy
the government of nunavut is working with federal officials to act now on their public commitment to develop a northern economic strategy
we are working to establish an economic development agreement between the government of canada and nunavut
we await a positive response from our federal partners on several current economic initiatives which are crucial to the growth of our economy
these include infrastructure development a partnership on geoscience and negotiations on the development of our fisheries
we must encourage our partners in both the public and private sectors to invest in the diverse economic opportunities we have throughout nunavut
and we must consult with the people of nunavut to ask for their participation in planning the development of our economy
if we plan well and make effective choices nunavut will have a bright future
making changes
the choices we make in the coming months will greatly affect our future
we must take the time necessary to ensure that our changes make programs and services better suited to nunavut s needs and vision
we have to be realistic in our expectations
priorities will have to be established
i want to assure you mr speaker that over the coming months we will consult with mla s and the people of nunavut in considering any and all future plans
we realize expectations are high and the desire for change is well founded
however changes will take time to implement
but be assured that our government is committed to change
a key will be our ability to be resourceful innovative and more efficient
we will have to do many things differently
a good example is the recently announced amalgamation of health and social service boards into the department of health and social service and the divisional education boards into the department of education
another good example is the decision to pursue private public partnering arrangements to provide some of our capital needs
one of the most important elements in the delivery of programs are our employees
the nunavut employees union which represent the largest number of employees has indicated that they would like to reopen negotiations for the current agreement which expires march 31 2000
the other union the federation of nunavut teachers has already given notice to begin the collective bargaining process
their current agreement expires august 31 1999
we will examine with the unions more innovative ways of compensating employees
however we must be aware that the outcome of these negotiations will have an impact on our current and future budgets
key to meeting nunavut s challenges will be how to manage all the future pressures for funding from limited financial resources
questions will have to be asked about how best to do things
the government can not answer these questions alone
input will be sought from the people of nunavut
together we will make the necessary decisions in the best interest of our land and its people
if we incorporate the knowledge of our people particularly our elders and community leaders we can establish a path that is right
our task as government will be to work with the people in all our communities to find the best way to move forward
this will take time but we will move forward
knowing where we spend money now will have an influence on where we set priorities in the future
doing something new will mean changing the way programs and services are currently provided
before we make any changes to our programs and services we must know the impact that such changes would have on the people of nunavut
we must be mindful of inuit qaujimajutuqangit iq in what and how we do things
whatever the situation change will only be introduced after the people of nunavut have been consulted
the issue is not whether changes will be necessary but rather when and what changes will be implemented
establishing our priorities
one of the most challenging tasks for any government is to identify priorities that matter to people and would make a difference in their lives
our government will address this challenge in a manner befitting the efforts that have led to the creation of our territory
there are three broad goals for the government of nunavut - establishing a more appropriate and better government
creating healthy communities families and individuals
and becoming more self-reliant
with regard to better and more appropriate government we will consult widely and listen to our people
the people of nunavut must be able to identify with all orders of government - municipal territorial and federal
our government will become more accessible less complex and more effective
we will work hard at improving our social programs
government will help provide the means for people and communities to make meaningful improvements in their daily lives
our approach will be wide and varied - from improvements to social housing to better education programs and more effective health programs
again we will listen to our people to tailor a nunavut strategy for developing healthier communities healthier families and healthier individuals to overcome our social challenges
to improve the daily lives of our people we also will need to become more self-reliant
this will mean more employment opportunities it will mean investments in education and training of our human resources it will mean investments in improving the overall health and well-being of our citizens
we will have to work closely with nti and other organizations to foster an atmosphere of trust and cooperation
we will have to get more from our resources
this means using our present resources wisely while pursuing new resources
we are committed to the negotiation of an agreement with the federal government that would enable nunavut to share in the prosperity of its natural resources
such an agreement would be a bold step forward enabling our government to be more self sufficient and less reliant on federal transfers in the future
establishing our priorities will enable nunavut to have a successful beginning
in mid june after the budget session there will be a caucus strategic planning retreat to deal with setting priorities as another step towards change
conclusions
mr speaker i am pleased to have presented a budget that will not only ensure the early success of our new territory but also will provide a strong foundation on which we can build
the needs of nunavummiut are great and they will be met
like the journey undertaken by the founders of nunavut we will need some time
we are committed to orderly change to ensure that our policies as well as programs and services will best meet the needs of our people
we will consult we will listen and we will initiate change change that will have long lasting benefit to all nunavummiut >>applause

people of a community working together to achieve a common goal or purpose
there has long been a desire for a co-op here in iqaluit

oral questions mr iqaqrialu
question 18 - 1 2
construction of road to keewatin
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the premier
the road that we were talking about yesterday in keewatin
my question
is that road viable for all of nunavut would it benefit all of the residents of nunavut
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we have no highway whatsoever in nunavut from southern canada
i think that once we have a highway anywhere in nunavut i think that it can benefit all the residents of nunavut in terms of cost savings
i think it can benefit everybody in nunavut
speaker interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr iqaqrialu second question
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
also my supplementary question will be that the building of this highway is going to be very expensive and there s going have to be feasibility studies done prior to the construction of the road
the funds that will be expended for the study would that come from nunavut government budget
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
hon paul okalik interpretation
yes thank you mr speaker

north american fur and fashion expedition
hon peter kilabuk
thank you mr speaker
i would like to reply to a comment that was made on may 13 1999 by glenn mclean member from baker lake
mr mclean was kind enough to acknowledge my participation in the north american fur and fashion exposition held earlier this month may 5th to 8th 1999
speaker interpretation
please sit down
i apologize it was my mistake you may go ahead and do your ministers statement mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk
thank you mr speaker
i ll go on from where i left off
first mr speaker i want to thank the member for baker lake for his generous remarks
the north american fur and fashion exposition provided nunavut with an opportunity to show our pride in our hunters and the importance of our sealskin by-products
i was proud to be there to represent our people and to speak about the importance of sealskin and other furs to our way of life
mr speaker i have no hesitation about educating the public outside of nunavut concerning the sale of our by-products such as sealskins
i believe it is our job to educate people about seal hunting in nunavut
it is our job to stand up for our culture
i am not at all reluctant to further educate lobby organizations with the facts to further promote our lifestyle and culture
in nunavut mr speaker our use of wildlife is today as it always has been sustainable
our seal hunt is a humane harvest
and every part of the seal we hunt is used - for our food and for our clothing
this is our tradition
this is our culture
our people have the right to continue this way of life and to hunt seal for their livelihoods
on the first day of the fur show mr speaker i addressed a news conference on the topic the importance of wildlife use for people on the land
this was followed by an interview on canadian television and by the american press
that evening more than seven hundred people attended a fashion show and dinner described as a tribute to nunavut
the fashion show featured the nunavut collection twenty-three beautiful sealskin coats
during the show i received a commemorative plaque from the fur council of canada and the north american fur and fashion exposition
the inscription on the plaque reads mr speaker to the people of nunavut
canada s first furrier
>>applause
the following day mr speaker i was able to speak with children at a school in montreal and to explain how inuit use the seal
this message was taken to three other schools in the montreal area
later that day my department sponsored a reception at the fur show which was attended by more than three hundred people
i believe mr speaker our message is getting through
at the montreal show the nunavut collection sold out
>>applause
i m told there were many many orders taken
our hunters our people were recognized and applauded for the sustainable and humane way we conduct our seal hunt
our message is being heard by more and more people around the world
our nunavut sealing strategy mr speaker is making progress
mr speaker to continue making progress our government must challenge the current trade restrictions that are imposed in the u s
through the marine mammal protection act the sealing strategy developed by our department highlights our cultural background economic opportunities and educational initiatives for both harvester and purchaser
if i may mr speaker i would like to recognize the staff of the department of sustainable development and in particular the work of larry simpson and ken toner who organized our participation at the montreal show
ms aaju peter from iqaluit made a series of excellent presentations in the montreal schools
monica ell from arctic creations was there also carlene arreak lucy idlout sylvia ipirautaq-cloutier eva sowdluapik phannelie palluq and vinnie karetak modelled sealskin clothing and performed traditional songs and dance

repatriation of inuit artifacts to nunavut
hon donald havioyak interpretation
mr speaker i would like to take this opportunity to speak on the need to return our artifacts to nunavut
over the last century many anthropologists and explorers visited our country and were amazed by our artifacts
they took the liberty remove these artifacts our tools our clothing even the bones of our deceased relatives and bring them back to their homes to studied and displayed
as a result of these items being taken nunavut is empty of our precious properties
okakti the artifacts represent our history the possessions of our ancestors they represent the way our great grandfathers and mothers lives
they represent inuit qaujimajatuqangit
with the people who removed them our artifacts have travelled far and wide and have taken their places on display and in storage areas of many universities and museums
most of these institutions believe that they came upon these artifacts honestly and feel very possessive of these artifacts
most institutions have preserved these items with great care
from that point of view i am proud of the way they been preserved
but we need them back
my department has been tasked as the guardian of our inuit culture and heritage
my department wishes to ensure that the inuit culture and heritage is defended and preserved
my department wants to ensure that many of the items that have been removed from our homeland be returned to nunavut
in order to bring back any artifacts nunavut has to have sufficient storage space to locate these items
mr speaker we need a heritage centre in nunavut my honourable colleagues we need your support in pursuing this important initiative
our department is working with birthright corporations in nunavut to promote our objective
discussions have started between our department and with nunavut tunngavik incorporated and with inuit heritage trust
through inuit qaujimajatuqangit we want to promote and reinforce community identity
we want to work with inuit organizations and nunavut communities to design the programs that would be housed in this nunavut heritage centre and how we can share these programs throughout our territory
our partners and i are committed to pursuing the requirement for a central facility which we in nunavut can gain knowledge from our past and be educated for the future koana okakti

question 3 - 1 2 incorporating inuit culture into government
hon donald havioyak interpretation
yes thank you mr speaker
on may 12 mr kevin o brien asked a question about inuit qaujimatuqangit
this member asked me a certain question and this is the answer to the question
interpretation ends
inuit traditional knowledge is obviously going to cost a certain amount of money
first let me say that iq is the work of various nunavut partners
iq was first discussed during the meeting of the elders that took place in igloolik in march 1998
this meeting was sponsored by the nunavut social development council under the article 32 in the nunavut land claims agreement
mr speaker the government of nunavut is a member of the working group committee of the nunavut social development council
our department was designated as a member of the working group
our mandate is to report our findings to the government of nunavut on inuit qaujimatuqangit
to date we have been discussing the topic of iq with other government departments within the government of nunavut
our discussions have been based on the ideas of incorporating iq into other departments
this topic of iq is going to be a long-term program which will be eventually be utilized by most of the government departments in the government of nunavut
it is going to take time however we are going to have it more understood by the government personnel through various means of communication
with respect to the question of funding i am unable to answer the question until some time when the legislative assembly reviews the estimates and approves the bill

thank you mr speaker
when you are trying to go to the baffin region from keewatin we have no mode of transportation directly
airline travel being the only way to go you have to go through a roundabout way to get here and airline travel is very expensive
i think we can look at alternative ways with more direct routes than there is now
i realize minister that you are new to this as we are and we expect that you will do something about this in the future
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
mr anawak would you be able to respond to that
hon jack anawak interpretation

i sent a letter to him last week about the proposed arena and i had a meeting with the mayor and council recently about that also
they told me what they want to do and asked if i could help them with that
i asked them to write a proposal and get a letter of support from the community so i have already responded to that and we are working on that question

gym for pelly bay
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to ask a question to the minister of government operations
this is in regards to the school gym
are you going to be looking at this concern from pelly bay and will there be a gym built this year
speaker interpretation
this is for the minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
looking at the budget and the speech that was made by the finance minister the priorities we have placed on these facilities are if there are safety concerns or health risks
with those priorities in mind and in reference to the members comments we do not have any plans to build it this year but it is in the plans but it is not in the 1999/2000 budget
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
questions mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
i should have addressed that to the minister of education
so what year are we looking at building that gym
speaker interpretation thank you mr alakannuark
mr arvaluk hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we were slotting it for 1999/2000 but the government has agreed to prioritize existing contracts ones that have been signed already those that are health or safety risks
we have made that decision because of financial restraint and the gym that the member is referring to was slotted for 99/2000 but because it is not a safety or health hazard we have placed it to another year
i am just following what i have placed in front of me and it is going to be at the discretion of the members here as to whether they are going to approve the budget

on friday may 14 the minister gave us his budget address

community empowerment & sustainable development review of departmental business plans 1999/2000
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
bear with me my colleagues
this was a last minute opportunity for me here
the standing committee on community empowerment & sustainable development report on the review of draft departmental business plans preliminary information on the 1999/2000 main estimates
the committees report reflects the unique circumstances surrounding its review of the 1999/2000 draft departmental business plans
many of the committees general observations and comments will be reflected in the reports of the other standing committees
mr speaker less than a month after the creation of nunavut the standing committees met to review the draft 3 year business plans of the departments of the government of nunavut
this work was carried out during the week of april 26 and involved appearances by all ministers
members of the committees had the opportunity to ask questions of ministers and their senior officials
the standing committees of the legislative assembly were constituted at the first sitting of the assembly on april 1
the standing committee on community empowerment & sustainable development has oversight responsibility for the department of justice sustainable development community government housing & transportation and public works telecommunications & technical services
the committee has the following general observations and comments
it should be recognized that the review process occurred in a uniquely short period of time
it contrasts to the practices in the western assembly where the review of business plans and main estimates takes place over a period of several months
members of the standing committees here had much less time
indeed we fully recognize that ministers themselves had very short timelines to familiarize themselves with their departments
mr speaker the committee recognizes that the budget process this year has been unique
both the 1999/2000 departmental estimates and capital plans were substantially decided upon prior to all members having the opportunity to make input
members were disappointed at the lack of clarity provided as to how some decisions were arrived at
we expect that the budget cycle for next year will involve significantly greater consultation both with regular members and with the communities
over the course of the week of the committees deliberations the amount and level of detail of information provided by the departments improved greatly
however it is our expectation that the information flow from the departments to the committees will improve in terms of time lines and level of detail as capacity is built within the departments
we also recognize that the capacity of departments to translate all materials into inuktitut is at present limited
it is our expectation that efforts will be made to ensure that capacity development in this regard is treated as a matter of priority of this government
mr speaker the committee noted that draft business plans were inconsistent in terms of the level of detail contained
it has been pointed out that the people of nunavut need to have clear expectations of what the government can deliver
departments have a role to play in communicating clearly what expectations are realistic given the constraints that are facing us
a point which all committee members noted was the frequency with which all of the departments referred to the concept of iq and its importance to the new government in terms of decision making
however there appears to be as yet little progress yet in defining and operationalizing this concept in any particular or systematic way
the success of its implementation depends upon people at all levels of government having a clear understanding of the concept and its critical importance
the committee were encouraged to hear ministers speak of the need to establish a close working relationship with the regular members of the assembly
the committee hopes that this commitment will be reflected in the way the government responds to our concerns and recommendations
regular members look forward to making a strong positive contribution to this government
thank you mr speaker

mr chairman i will now conclude by stating that the department of finance and administration has made a lot of progress in meeting its broad mandate

thank you
chairperson interpretation

mr akesuk
thank you mr chairman i will report in english
minister ng appeared before the committee on the morning of april 29th
the main estimate summary provided to the committee indicated a total 99/2000 expenditure of 27 million 547 thousand 673 dollars
as with the department of the executive and governmental affairs the committee recognizes the role finance and administration plays as a central agency
the department mandate is to provide the government of nunavut with advice on matters relating to fiscal management and to ensure efficient government wide management of financial resources
citizen involvement in budget development
the committee was intrigued at the draft business plans reference to providing for public information in the budget formulation process
the committee will be supportive of efforts to hold community workshops in which members participate in hearing the view of the public
the committee also recommends that the department make an effort to provide clear budget information to elders and the public
the committee appreciated receiving a detailed briefing on federal/nunavut fiscal relations
the committee is supportive of the departments mandate to aggressively pursue revenue enhancement opportunities with the government of canada
the committee was also advised that these costs are offset in the ffa
the committee recommends that the department continue to make strong efforts in these areas
the committee would also like to be regularly updated as the department identifies one- time or unforeseen costs associated with establishing the new government
the committee would like to receive a full accounting of these costs to the government of nunavut
the committee also recognizes that a number of issues may not have been finalized yet

comments to the department of finance and administration
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would prefer that maybe after they make a report i will have a few things to state or should i pose my question now
chairperson interpretation
the minister already made his report and now it is open for comments and questions mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in respect to the deficits that they alluded to which is the 4 million dollars for the oic
we were told where it had come from and it affects the nunavut government because even before we were up and running there was a deficit outstanding
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu did that answer your question or do you have any further comments
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
that way it is creating a problem unless it is clarified both to the mlas because they have to understand for what the payables have been incurred
because we never did the work of the office of the interim commissioner so i just wanted to state that again mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman once the final audit is complete and the accounting for the financial affairs of the office of the interim commissioner there will be a breakdown of the expenditures under that office
thank you
chairperson interpretation
further comments mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
i would like to see that in our future meetings
chairperson interpretation
is that just a comment or do you want to answer that mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman we have little choice in the matter
unfortunately it is a legal agreement
the office of the interim commissioner had the mandate through the nunavut act to operate and do the preparatory work for the establishment of the government of nunavut
once the government of nunavut took office on april 1st became a legal entity the office of the interim commission dissolved
i mean obviously it would have been ideal if that wasn t the situation but unfortunately that is the matter that we have to deal with and the legal obligation is there
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in respect to the same item or within the same arena in respect to the deficit of the oic which was stated to be 4 4 million dollars
in respect to the funds that had to be taken out for example some of the capital projects that we have planned had to be taken out to meet the 4 4 million dollar budget
was that the case where we had to take away capital projects in order to pay this 4 4 million-dollar deficit
hon kelvin ng
no mr chairman that wasn t the case
what this affects is the opening balance of the government of nunavut
in effect it is a liability that is offset against the assets that would be coming over from the division of the assets and liabilities with the g n w t
it doesn t affect the current year the 99/2000 fiscal year per se
thank you
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
i guess my question is just wondering in the report the audit that the minister alluded to will there be in there explanation as to how such a sizeable deficit was obtained
i know that we all know that the federal government had federal advisors right at the highest levels i was wondering how if they were aware of this how they let it get to the level it was
if that will be pointed out in the report
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
which of you would like to answer this question
hon kelvin ng
so we will have to wait just like anybody else the outcome of what s in that and what kind of comments or recommendations that they might have
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
if you re just going to wait is there something that the department will be asking their federal counterparts as to how they let it slide for the 4 4 million dollars over
thank you mr chairman
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
they also have a chance to dialogue with the auditor generals staff as they move forward analyzing the report
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman i guess that still doesn t answer
will the department be approaching the department that was responsible in diand for ascertaining if they were aware they were going to run this deficit and how they allowed it to happen thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman there has been some discussions but i think also that the premier has brought up the issue with the minister of diand and spoken to her about it
but as it stands now until the final results are in i think things are kind of in a state of waiting until the final report is out mr chairman
thank you
thank you mr chairman mr chairman it is an accrued liability
as i indicated it ll off set some of the assets that we have coming over from the gnwt in the division of assets and liabilities
there are plans to go forward and try to recoup some of those costs
whether or not we re successful there s another matter i guess but it s certainly an issue
thank you mr mclean please recognize the chair because you ll have to recognize me as i am the chair
chairperson interpretation minister or his deputy or his assistant deputy minister
mr chairman thank you
mr chairman it isn t a 99/2000 year expenditure
it s an opening balance liability because this is the first time we set up and it s an opening balance sheet item
it ll reduce that balance that was coming over though as far as the opening balance goes
thank you

mr minister you ve indicated in your budget in reference to revenues it includes 3 million dollars in revenue from property taxes of school levies
will this money go back into general revenue or does it go back to the communities where we generated it from
chairperson interpretation
minister of finance & administration
i really want to give you an inuktitut name
mr ng

as long as it s a good one
mr chairman all revenues that the members see there go into the general consolidated revenue fund and are disbursed based on appropriations through the assembly and the recommendations of the government

another tax question
in reference to the payroll tax
thank you
chairperson interpretation
minister of finance & administration
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
it returns more to lower income earners than what it takes in
they get a rebate back and i believe that it s 1 1/4 % instead of 1% for the lower income earners within the territory
so that s another issue that would have to be taken into consideration of the review of this specific tax
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr minister are you considering any new tax reform initiatives over the next year

mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i want to pose this question to minister of finance & administration or his i don t know who s responsible for this
respect to the hamlets they usually have funding for one fiscal year to be used within that year and the budget have been cut throughout the year and i guess my question is related to that
are the hamlets i think some of them are leery because their budgets are getting cut and they re concerned that their budgets might be cut for their operational funding
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark you may answer this if you wish or we could wait for a response until we get to the minister of municipal and community affairs
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
i think i tried to indicate in my opening comments that we ve tried to provide as much stability as possible during the course of this years operation
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
that s it
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr minister your budget address sets out an important goal of the government of the nunavut to have a balanced budget this is very important
how will your department ensure that other departments do not go over their budget
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister of finance & administration mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman we plan to be monitoring the expenditures on a regular basis of the other departments
in fact right now we re providing a lot of the financial support services for those departments because they don t have their financial management sections up and running fully yet
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister of finance & administration mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
so yes there are situations where that happens
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
those types of deficits will they have an impact on the government of the nunavuts budgets as ultimately they receive their funding from the government
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister of finance and administration mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
so there s no direct legal liability to the government of nunavut but obviously since they are organizations that we re supporting we would work with them and we would try to get them out of that situation
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman obviously if we are to take over responsibilities for those specific boards we would assume the liabilities or the assets in that kind of circumstances for their operations
thank you
chairperson interpretation
i guess this is a last question
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess in light of all that has your department or have you considered introducing balanced budget legislation
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman as some members know the northwest territories and other jurisdiction have balanced budget legislation and that could restrict going into too much deficit
it is something we can look at at some point
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
now the nunavut government as you are looking at the operations we have to look at the holiday pay and benefits
what are your plans for re-implementing the benefits packages our employees use to have
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr minister you may answer this or if you prefer it just be deferred to the human resources minister
hon kelvin ng
i ll speak on his behalf i think
mr chairman there are no plans to reinstate any of the benefits that were eroded when the government of the northwest territories underwent their deficit strategy in trying to curtail their spending
i think it s safe to say that we know that there s expectations amongst the two major unions
once the collective bargaining process begins will have to wait until the positions are formally tabled and the negotiations are hopefully successfully concluded
but it s really premature at this time and even if we did have an inkling of what we were proposing i mean this wouldn t be the appropriate forum to bring that forward mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
in some ways it was beneficial where some of the benefits were cut because of other residents in nunavut who did not have those benefits
still past employees miss those benefits and they re expected to have them reinstated
i would ask a person be appointed or you work with employees unions that there be a working committees struck to review this issue
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
we re going to be waiting until human resources comes up
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation

mr o brien
mr o brien

my question to the minister relates to forced growth and i d like to know what the minister has factored into the budget regarding forced growth what s the status on this issue
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr minister i believe you indicated that there s was approximately 10 million dollars in the reserve
given that factor if there s nothing in the budget right now for forced growth looking at the way we re expanding here in nunavut and we ve been looking at power subsidies and so on
is it fair to say that it wouldn t take very long to chew up that 10 million dollars we d find ourselves in that situation which mr tootoo was referring to and find ourselves basically over spending
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
thank you
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
just one final question in reference to this area
talking about forced growth and the 10 million dollars that we have now in reserve and some of the factors that will cause some concerns in the coming months
how has the minister considered the decentralized modelled in reference to this budget
i know you ve indicated that which certain positions may not be filled so maybe some money is left over and of course that s not my wish nor some of my colleagues here
we see the decentralized model as probably the corner stone one of the corner stones of the nunavut government
so how has the minister incorporated this into his overall budget
thank you
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman within the departmental budgets now i have the understanding that they are funded to the levels of the decentralized model
thank you
mr o brien
mr chairman we ll hold the minister to that

mr chairman i am just asking if you are going to provide detailed information on how you are going to collect taxes
thank you
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson yes we will provide the information if it is the detail that the honourable member is asking for in respect to how it is collected
we will also provide the breakdown of the categories
thank you
chairperson interpretation
any further comments
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
minister just a question in reference to one of the pension plans that was set up by the former government and how it relates to this government here
it is my understanding that the pension fund after all of the pensions were paid out there would be approximately 9 million dollars left over that was going to go back into the general funds
would the nunavut government see any portion of that 9 million dollars
chairperson interpretation
minister ng or one of his officials
hon kelvin ng
mr chairman it is my understanding that it is part of the division of assets liability agreement on the table that was entered into and agreed upon for the division of assets and liabilities
so we will get our 44% portion
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman in reference to the division of assets and liabilities
can the minister tell the members exactly how the process is set up and who from the nunavut side is involved in this process to ensure that we get a fair and equal division of the assets and liabilities
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson i ll ask mr tootoo to speak to that one as he was heavily involved in the aspects of that
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
the agreement itself has been signed for some time it s in the implementation stage
i was personally involved with the negotiations around the agreement and up until the signing and slightly afterwards
now for the implementation there is an implementation committee set up to administer the agreement
rod malcolm is here today as well he s the assistant comptroller general and he s nunavuts lead representative on the implementation committee for the division of assets and liabilities
he and his staff are the ones who will be ensuring that the agreement is implemented in the spirit it was negotiated and that nunavut gets its fair share
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
it s my understanding that this government is to enter agreements rather to contracts of approximately 50% plus services i guess from the gnwt
can the minister tell members how that is impacting on this government
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
so they have the staffing dollars that are going to be used for the contracting fees
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson each department made their own contractual arrangements for services
but generally speaking i would think that they would be more of a cost because there would be some administrative fees on top of providing the services back to our government
thank you
chairperson
thank you
i believe those are just comments
anything else further
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
in reference to the same question that was brought up in regards to contracting back to the territorial government
i believe that it s going to cost more and i hope to see the nunavut legislative assembly seek contractors within the nunavut area instead of going outside of the nunavut territory
i believe that we will have to work hard to find contractors because of course we will be spending more in the long run if we contract the territorial government
chairperson
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson a lot of these services are provided by a government that already have the infrastructure established and it can t be provided by a general contractor because of the speciality and the expertise
thank you
chairperson interpretation
iqaqrialu is that all
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation yes
i apologize mr chairperson
thank you mr chairperson
it s a very important subject and i believe that if we contracted from the nunavut government from the nunavut area it was just recently that this part of nunavut was established
we have to look at ways and means as to how we can increase our economic development around the nunavut area
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson i don t disagree with the member just the matter of the timing in respect to trying to build the capabilities within our own civil service to carry out those functions
thank you
chairperson
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i wanted to return to a previous issue in regards to income tax
as we heard income taxes that are being deducted from both the federal and territorial government does that mean that we will also be deducting a nunavut income tax from our salaries
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
yes mr chairperson the nunavut income tax is a percentage of the federal tax that s collected
so we set the nunavut personal income tax rate and it s remitted to us from the federal government as part of their overall collection of income taxes
thank you
chairperson interpretation
any further comments questions
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
maybe to use an example of the provinces the rest of the provinces pay provincial taxes
for example in the province of ontario they pay 7% pst
and my question is is there going to be another level of tax imposed on the nunavut territory
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
right now mr chairperson right now no there hasn t been any additional taxes put in place for the nunavut territory
the nunavut territory has no provincial sales tax
the nunavut territory has no sales tax
and it s the same income tax rate for personal income tax that we ve taken over to date
thank you
chairperson
okay
good
mr nutarak was that you
maybe they can t hear me
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
in reference to mr nutaraks question what he was trying to ask the minister was is there going to be a nunavut services tax sometime in the future
is there going to be an established nunavut services tax sometime in the future
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson it s too early to say one way or another
we ll see what the sense is to develop the next budget
thank you
chairperson interpretation
very good now
questions or comments if there s nothing further
quite a lot of hands came up
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you
you mentioned 500 thousand hundred dollars for p3 initiative
can the minister inform us what projects this will include
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson this doesn t go into any specific project per se
it s for the development of the government of nunavut s policies and procedures surrounding how we would implement and go through the public/private partnership arrangements
thank you
chairperson
i still have two names on the list and after these two have spoken we ll take a break
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
just going back to that general question you indicated earlier that the formula financing agreement allows for the decentralized model
in your budget address you indicated that this formula financing grant is intended to allow the delivery of the same level of services in nunavut as was previously offered by the gnwt
do you feel confident that that same level or are you comfortable with that same level of services will be provided to the residents of nunavut based on the resources that we have to work with
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson that is bit of a subjective question
thank you
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
going back to another question you mentioned that the over-expenditure from the oic office would be a liability that s been carried forward that s going to be offset against assets that we re getting from the gnwt
i m not an accountant but explain how something that was incurred in one year is offset against something coming in from another area
i m just wondering if you could clarify that for me because it s not totally clear
thank you mr chairperson
hon kelvin ng
i guess the way i would understand it if i m wrong the accountants sitting here could correct me
so the 50 less the 4 we would have 46 million dollars opening balance in respect to assets on april 1st 1999
that s basically my understanding of it
thank you
chairperson
your last question mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson it s my understanding that the audit of the oic operations may be concluded by the end of june
around that timetable
for the assets and liabilities with the gnwt is october of 1999 i believe where that is supposed to be concluded
thank you
chairperson
we ll get back to you later on
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairperson
my question to the finance minister is the allocation of capital dollars is based on standards criteria health safety and other factors
the standards and criteria that we brought over from gnwt are old and outdated
it s probably 10-15 years old
is your department looking at setting standards and criteria and health and safety factors that reflect the true needs of the people of nunavut
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson we haven t undertaken that exercise as yet
the plan would be to undertake that but the problem we have of course is the timing
no i ve given the priorities of trying to get things up and running as it stands now
we can only do so much with so many individuals and we all recognize that we have a lot of hard working staff but they re not all fully staffed yet within the departments
so there s a lot of issues that we have trying to get operational right now that has been the priority of all of the departments
thank you
chairperson
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairperson
this will be my final question to that answer
thank you
chairperson
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
normally the department of public works our public works telecommunications and technical services have a big component of the development of standards and criteria in respect to facilities
i don t know what kind of timetable they would have
probably when the minister comes you can ask on that
but certainly in respect of overall goals and priorities the five year capital planning projects that we re planning on undertaking this fall those kind of issues would be relevant in those discussions thank you
chairperson
perhaps we ll take 10 minutes short break
thank you
>>committee recesses
chairperson
i apologize
we ll just continue on with the department and i will just continue on with the names on the list that i have
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
there s a feedback somewhere
thank you mr chairperson
in regards to this is a supplementary to mr tootoo s comments although mr ng had responded by saying that there will be negotiations on the division of the liabilities and assets
but when you state that the regular members have no authority or input according to the way you responded will we have input or will we be involved or will we participate
will we participate during the process of dividing the assets and liabilities
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
thank you
minister ng you may respond now
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson there s no plans for mla s or for ministers for that matter to participate
this is strictly an officials function because the formula and all the agreements were agreed upon prior to march 31st
they re signed off by the government of the nwt and the office of the interim commissioner in respect to percentages and what counts and doesn t count
it s all laid out in the division of assets and liabilities agreement that was agreed upon by the legal entities that had the authority to enter into discussions and make the final agreement
so we re following through in implementing what ever that agreement was just to make sure that there s nothing that falls between the cracks
thank you
chairperson
member mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
prior to the establishment of the nunavut government all these processes were prepared before the election of the legislative assembly
i feel that the members of the legislature should be involved
once we have been elected we should be involved in the process and we should also be involved in the agreements that have been signed off
since after being elected can t we make changes as members of the legislative assembly as elected people
we also state that in the programs we would like to see programs according to the needs of nunavut residents
we should be involved and we should deal with this issue again
even though the agreements have been signed off with the territorial government and nunavut government i would like to be able to make changes and amendments to the agreements that were signed off
because during my campaign that s what i spoke about
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
minister ng would you like to respond
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson i guess the way i would explain it is it s not a political negotiation it s not a political exercise
it s strictly an accounting of officials work is what it comes out to because there s an agreed upon criteria to divide the assets and liabilities
so that s the only way i can explain it for the member
thank you
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
i m finished
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
mr chairperson there s been some fairly detailed news coverage on the 20 million dollars that s going to be put in housing for nunavut
correct me mr minister if i m mistaken i think it just recently covered in the national news and so on
can the minister tell us exactly how that money is going to be distributed what type of housing
thank you
chairperson
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson when the minister of community government housing and transportation comes before the committee we ll have the details of the breakdowns and the programs that are being proposed for those funded under his department
i don t have that detail before me
in respect to the budget i present the broader government programs highlight some of those programs to the assembly and deliver the budget speech and the details
that s why we have the cabinet and the ministers that are responsible for their portfolios to provide more of the details of what their programming is mr chairperson
thank you
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
i understand what you re saying mr minister and that s fine if we re talking about one hundred thousand dollars
we re talking about 20 million dollars
let s say we have $20 000 000 00 dollars for housing is it for social housing
is it home ownership
you must have some preliminary concepts you are going to pass out to the members here
thank you
chairperson
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson we are dealing with the finance and administration department budget today and broader government responsibilities and initiatives that will fall under the department of finance and administration
again i don t have the details for the community government housing and transportation budget here and it s more appropriate for that minister to be responding to the programs within his jurisdiction not me as a finance minister
thank you
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
i ll accept then mr chairperson if the minister doesn t know what exactly the 20 million dollars is for
but i think we ve gone through a lot of detail this afternoon on various issues and i just thought that it was a more than fair question to find out if it was social housing or home ownership
i think it is pretty large sum of money that we re talking about
i thought that information would be readily available
no more questions thank you
chairperson
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson i had indicated i m not the minister of cght
i know that the 20 million dollars is for delivering up social housing programs
home ownership is a whole blend of a housing component
it s pretty broad when you talk about housing and the minister has that detail
i don t have that detail here
if i had it i d provide it to the member
thank you
chairperson
your last question mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
i ve indicated that i accepted that the minister did not know what the money was for and that s fine
thank you
chairperson
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
although you responded to this question i would like to comment on it further that we will go into a deficit a little bit over 5 million dollars
would the minister be able to look for new dollars from the federal government to be utilized for this deficit because it seems that this deficit is not the responsibility of the nunavut government
this doesn t look too good for the new nunavut government would the minister be able to look for new funding or new dollars to be utilized for the deficit
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
yes mr chairperson the intent is that we would pursue with our federal counterparts at every opportunity some of what we felt were their obligations instead of ours
thank you
chairperson interpretation
do you want to make a supplementary comment
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
mr chairperson my name is irqittuq not erkidjuk
you and the premier i would be able to give you some advice so you would be able to take it along to the federal government
we have been helping those albanians while there are many people sleeping on the street in canada and in nunavut we are in a deficit
so i can support you out if you need more tools or bullets if you want to go down to ottawa
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson i appreciate the members comments
thank you

mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
earlier i asked about how your department would ensure the other departments wouldn t go over budget and you indicated that you are just going to monitor them
are there any more detailed plans as far as what the exact processes will be in place other than that we are just going to keep an eye on them
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
member for iqaluktutsiaq mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson as i think i also indicated because a lot of departments didn t have their financial management services in place yet that the department and finance & administration was providing those services for them
so we are processing all of the payments and we are doing all of the details on the financial side for all of the departments so we re right there first hand in respect to the expenditures of the departments
all ministers also sit on the financial management board where all expenditures of the government are co-ordinated
thank you
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
somehow i knew you were going to say that
is there a process in place if some one comes back partway through for additional resources for the department
what s the process involved there and will those resources have to be cut somewhere else to make up for that
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo that is your last question
mr tootoo
is there a set criteria or something that is used in that or is that something that is brought up on an as discovered or as needed basis
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr ng do you want to respond to that
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson there are pretty stringent financial management board guidelines that outline the expenditures that departments have and in what circumstances they can come for supplementary appropriations
so those guidelines are there and ultimately its the financial management board that approves or disapproves after justification based on those guidelines that are put forward
thank you
chairperson interpretation
i have no further names on the list of members of the legislative assembly
are there any further comments from the floor
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
mr chairperson another question personally i would like to thank the other members for sticking around to hear this a prelude i guess to what you are going to be in for for the rest of the week
my last question is in regards to lease costs that are being incurred by the nunavut government
i understand for example that the legislative assembly building is now being those lease costs are being incurred by the government of nunavut
i am just wondering if the minister has an answer to that
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr ng if you wish to respond
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson that question is more appropriate to be answered by the minister of public works telecommunications & technical services who has responsibility for buildings standards and criteria
thank you
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson if you could respond to the question
i am sorry mr tootoo is that all
comments questions members comments
now with respect to the budget assumptions and main estimates we are going to go to page 34 3-4 under directorate
so if you could open page 34 in your government of nunavut main estimates binder in 3-4 the directorate are there any questions or comments in respect to the directorate
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i stated earlier at the top in 6 - 08 in respect to the inuktitut translation i understand that this is 608
i would like the members to have better understanding because as an inuk i understand this to mean 608 dollars and it is kind of misleading
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
we will reach that shortly but we are dealing with the directorate
if there are any other comments in respect to the directorate we are still in 3-4 item on the directorate and the total expenditure for operations and maintenance is 825 thousand dollars
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
historically it has been done in thousands of dollars thank you
chairperson interpretation
i would now pose the question as to whether the 825 thousand is approved
agreed
capital items
there is no total capital for the directorate
there is nothing in respect to the capital items the total expenditures for the directorate budget stands at 825 thousands dollars
a member
agreed
chairperson interpretation
agreed
open the next page to 3-5 fiscal policy and expenditure management
the operations and maintenance in total is 3 million 30 thousand dollars
in respect to the capital there is nothing in the total capital budget items and therefore the total expenditures for fiscal policy and expenditure management is 3 million and 30 thousand dollars
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i am just wondering if the minister in going through each of these could just provide us with the total number of py s in each division and a total number for the department
if that would be possible
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson in this particular branch 8 1
chairperson interpretation
does that answer your question mr tootoo
mr tootoo
just asking if he could do that for each division so we can get a total for the whole department
thank you mr chairperson
hon kelvin ng
oh you want it for the whole department
chairperson interpretation
we are still on page 3-6 financial services
the operations and maintenance in total is 1 million 213 thousand dollars
agreed
capital items there are no capital items for financial services so therefore the total expenditures are 1 million 213 thousand dollars
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
again i would just like to know the total number of py s that are involved
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng 11 2 in financial services
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
in financial services this is a division that looks after all of the other departments
as the minister indicated earlier they are going to be providing all of the financial services for all of the other departments
i am just wondering if that includes taking that into consideration or did that take into consideration each department having their own finance division
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
i will ask mr vardy to respond to this one
mr vardy
okay the financial services division will provide support to the financial services staff in all departments but there will be capacity built up in each department
it is more a support and co-ordinating role in the first probably four years in the new government
after once you get the capacity established in the departments that group will get smaller in finance and we will have controls through the comptrollership role like the government accounting as well as the budgeting
its a transitional type service we are providing not only to departments but also to boards and agencies to make sure there are proper financial systems in place in the government
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i would imagine that this number over time would go down as those responsibilities are devolved to the departments
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
yes
chairperson interpretation
we are still on page 3-6 the total expenditures is 1 million 213 thousand dollars
in respect to informatics in 3-7 the total operations and maintenance altogether is 4 million 506 thousand dollars
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman i wonder if the minister could just speak briefly as to what their actual plan is for this informatics technology program i guess
how do they ensure that all of the communities have access to this and it is as user friendly as possible

i ll ask mr vardy once again on this one mr chairperson
thank you
mr vardy
the informatics program of the government of nunavut could be a very massive expenditure
it is one of the main reasons why the oic went over their budget is because of underestimates of the cost of setting up the technology in a decentralized manner throughout the territory
what we have in finance is the systems development side and in public works they are responsible for the operations and the technical side of the system
in the systems development side we have a budget of around 4 million dollars for next year
if you develop the type of it system that everyone would like that is if you tallied up the requests from all of the departments we could easily spend 10 times that in nunavut next year
with regard to the actual set up of the network in each location it is probably a better question to direct to the department of public works
what we have there now the big systems are the payroll system human resource management system the peoplesoft
its one that is critically important but is an area that if its not tightly managed you could easily chew up a big portion of the budget of the territory
i think there is a desire on everyone s part to have the most advanced system in place but in a territory of this size we can operate without having such systems in place right away in all departments
i think it is a goal that all governments have of having those systems
in the north as well we have to look at the trade off between it and other communication modes including air travel
it s a high priority area to get a handle on
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
i am sure that it is a major task and fairly expensive
just my last question and without getting into detail when this does occur when we have a finished product is it the intention to have it in french english inuktitut
mr vardy
mr chairperson
definitely in english and inuktitut
i don t know the extent that we will have the programming done in french
chairperson interpretation
i wanted to speak shortly and remind you to please recognize the chairperson before you speak and please wait patiently while the chairperson recognizes you
we have to stick to procedure
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
just on the py s
thank you mr chairperson

mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
in respect to the computers and the informatics if i didn t just hear about computers i have heard about the y2k bug and that there will be problems with all of the computers
is this going to create a big problem for the government the y2k bug
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
i believe you are speaking to computers but could you speak to the y2k and what effect it may have on the government
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson first of all in answer to mr tootoo s question it is 4 5 py s and we think that all of the systems we have in place are y2k compliant at this time
thank you
chairperson interpretation
are you going to respond to mr iqaqrialus question
hon kelvin ng
i was trying to say in response to his question that we think all of the systems we have are y2k compliant so there won t be any problems
a lot of the stuff was developed recently after identification of the potential y2k problem
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
let s proceed the total expenditures is 4 million 506 thousand dollars
agreed
there s nothing in capital items so therefore the total expenditures for informatics is 4 million 506 thousand dollars
agreed
some members
agreed
chairperson interpretation
okay
let s proceed to the next page 3-8 comptrollership the operations and maintenance budget is 17 million 974 thousand dollars
there are no capital expenditures therefore the total expenditures for comptrollership are 17 million 974 thousand dollars
agreed
the next page 3-9 details of grants & contributions
i wish to ask a question to the members
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
in respect to this issue i don t quite understand the meaning of this in relation to the itemized budget
perhaps if you could clarify the items in details of grants & contributions
hon kelvin ng
go ahead mr vardy
chairperson interpretation
mr vardy you may proceed
mr vardy
mr chairperson the grants & contributions occur in different divisions throughout our department
in government accounting we have insurance premiums of 1 5 million dollars
sorry in response to that particular question 3 8 million is for power subsidies
it is just a continuation of the existing subsidies that the government of the nwt had in place
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu supplementary
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
in respect to the 3 8 million dollars and how much expenditure we may be looking forward to the power plant which is supposed to be built in clyde river
perhaps there will be different rates for the different regions in nunavut for power
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
this is again based on maintaining stability in programs
it is based on the yellowknife market rate for power consumption and i believe it is subsidized for private homeowners up to 700 kilowatt hours per month based on that yellowknife rate
it is an ongoing program and it is what was spent on the nunavut side last year and it is a continuation of that subsidy
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
is this geared only towards homeowners
is not everyone eligible for this subsidy
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
it is my understanding that all home operators have accessibility to the subsidy program so you can be renting a unit and still get a subsidy on your power consumption on that unit
thank you
chairperson interpretation
did that answer your question mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu supplementary
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
while we are on this issue in relation to the budget items perhaps when mr picco is here i can pose further questions so i will just let this go
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
report on the budget for detailed grants & contributions
i would like everyone to know that they will not proceed because at this time they are for information purposes only
we are at 3-9 the details for grants & contributions
this is just an information item to help us understand why they have budgeted what they have
at this point in time i would like to ask if these are agreed to
are you agreed
agreed
on the next page 2 - 10 distribution of budget
again for your information
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
mr chairperson we are on 3-10
okay
on that i would like to ask the minister if he would explain this taking a look at the total operations & maintenance for the three regions
the baffin has 734 thousand keewatin is 1 million 103 thousand and the kitikmeot is 977 thousand
given that the baffin is twice as large as the other two regions i would just like to inquire as to why the difference in the dollar amounts
if he could explain that
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson it is mainly because the baffin region is being serviced from the headquarters division right now
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
we have about twice the population in the baffin area and baffin has 1/2 the budget
why is that
chairperson interpretation
we can discuss that at a later time
mr arvaluk did you have a comment
hon james arvaluk interpretation
mr chairperson it is the same question that was asked by the previous member
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
distribution of budget
okay then we will refer back to 3-3

mr speaker these students have had much to be proud of they have worked very hard and i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate each one of them for their commitment and dedication
mr speaker the x-ray assistants program is an example of the kind of medical training we want to see more of

students like those who graduated on saturday represent a step towards a goal of increased self-sufficiency for nunavut

congratulations to students of inuglak school
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
today i rise to make a statement and i would like to take this opportunity to highlight the recent accomplishment of some of our students and teachers for which i m especially proud
this competition is open to any school which holds a scholastic book fair and it s held right across canada
it is important to know that the winning entrants are professionally published and sold all across canada at scholastic book fairs
the winning school also receives a 1 thousand-dollar cash prize
interpretation ends
i would like to further highlight the extent of this accomplishment
that inuglak school submission was completed by students whose first language is inuktitut
i m happy to report that inuglak school won first place out of one hundred eighty entries from across canada
this is an ideal project for the students of inuglak to work together in order to create culturally relevant material that is now a source of pride
i would especially like to note the contributions of the following teachers
project advisors michael montcombroux ken jacobi sue callard

members statement 36 - 1 2 condition of iqaluit roads
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
iqaluit has the honourable distinction of being canada s newest and smallest territorial capital
however it also has the dubious distinction of being perhaps the community with the largest pot holes in the entire country
as our capital iqaluit is for many visitors the first and last sight of nunavut
a capital should reflect the beauty strength and character of it s jurisdiction
mr speaker iqaluit does all of this and more
just yesterday while driving behind our new minister of health and social services i was startled to note that the ministers van suddenly took a dip and disappeared from view
several tense seconds passed before he emerged from one of iqaluits infamous pot holes
i am certain that all honourable members will join me in expressing relief at his narrow escape
as visiting members will have noticed we wear seat belts not just to protect ourselves in the event of collision but to prevent the roofs of our vehicles from being dented as we bounce over the pot holes
mr speaker i fully support council and mayor kilabuk in their efforts to address this issue
i will do what i can to help ensure that the council receives adequate resources to fix our roads and hopefully to pave them
mr speaker our community is a capital for all of nunavut and has much more to offer to visitors and residents alike than a bone shaking drive
i urge us to get to work on this

i have a return to an oral question asked by the mla for amittuq on may 13 1999 regarding an addition to be built onto the school in hall beach
mr speaker decisions surrounding capital projects and which ones were to proceed this year were based on three criteria
a capital project would proceed if
construction work on the building had already begun there was already a binding commitment to proceed
orthere was a critical safety issue which required the work to be done
mr speaker the proposed work on the hall beach school after being reviewed by the capital projects review committee was deemed not to meet this year s criteria

there s quite a few pieces of paper in front of us especially from the communities i m representing
i m not sure where they are going because it s in transition because they keep getting sent back so i m wondering if we re playing musical chairs here with the letters from the communities
in that case for example the hamlet would be using their surplus to make this purchase
i want to raise this in the legislature mr speaker because they have been sending these copies of the letters which had been sent originally to the nwt government and i believe as well to the nunavut government

minister of community government housing & transportation and i understand this issue i believe that it s a deficit or a budget deficit in clyde river
i knew there was a problem even before i became a minister and while it was still under the purview of the g n w t government
as i became a minister i spoke with my deputy minister well unfortunately i ve not had the opportunity to talk with him about this
i know he s dealing with the issue perhaps i can tell him that it is being taken care of however i will inquire as to what the status is
i m sorry if he raises another question i am not trying to close it if he wants to add a supplementary
thank you mr speaker

mr iqaqrialu supplementary
mr iqaqrialu interpretation

thank you mr speaker

mr anawak minister of community government housing & transportation
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes they are able to deal with this and they will work with the hamlet to resolve these issues

oral questions
mr o brien
question 39 - 1 2
decentralization
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question s for the acting premier
mr speaker all the members in the room realize and know how important decentralization is to the smaller less fortunate communities
yesterday i posed a question to the minister of finance in reference to if the funding was incorporated into the budget to ensure that the decentralized model would take place
the minister indicated that the funding was incorporated into the budget and that was good news
unfortunately we also heard that the premier indicated that they have commissioned a study to re-evaluate the decentralization process
i d like to ask the acting premier as to who is doing the study and why the study is being done
thank you
speaker
two questions mr ng minister of finance
thank you acting premier
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as it stands now it isn t per se a study from the perspective of what people would perceive as a study
i think what the members have to recognize too is that it s easy to put in the position but you have to have the support in respect of housing in respect to the office space
thank you
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
mr ng minister of finance
hon kelvin ng
yes mr speaker it goes back to the priorities of the government and the timing back to the timing of the implementation of decentralization and of staffing of the government as a whole
again that s another factor that has to be taken into consideration
members recognize that not all the headquarters functions are up and running fully as it stands now anywhere from 30% to 40-45% for some of the headquarter levels of departments right now
so it s a matter of setting some priorities and having a rational schedule and timing and a plan for how we re going to implement it
that s where the difficulties are right now in respect to the government planning and procedures in establishing the decentralized model

mr acting premier
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker this government has said that we re committed to the principles of the decentralized model as they were laid out and it is a matter of the logistics
if i can use another example that has been brought to our attention the community of gjoa haven and having liquor warehousing in that community whether or not that makes sense
another matter for example that has to be considered is the community of kugluktuk and legal registries when all the support services for filing in the legal system are based here in iqaluit
those are the broader implementation issues that we re trying to come to grips with
thank you
speaker
thank you mr ng
second supplementary mr o brien
mr o brien

when do we think that we can give the communities a firm commitment

mr ng
hon kelvin ng

mr speaker can the member repeat the question please
speaker
mr tootoo
mr tootoo

the minister indicated that they would be hiring a co-ordinator to co-ordinate the implementation plan
i would take that as indicating that the department has an implementation plan that they will be implementing
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
mr arvaluk minister of education
hon james arvaluk
mr speaker after the decision was made in kimmirut and subsequently with the regular members we started wheels moving immediately after that because before the decision was made before kimmirut we couldn t foresee how the recommendations would take place
when the recommendation to have no boards was taken later then we didn t really have time to date to put all the implementation plans together before the members sat
as soon as that becomes available and as soon as we hire one that hiring does not come from the minister or the department itself it would only make a recommendation to the cabinet
as soon as the cabinet makes a decision then i would be happy to report

question 41 - 1 2
decentralized positions for hall beach
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i ve a question to the minister of finance regarding the jobs
i believe there are seventy-two and a half py s in my constituency
my question is are we going to get those seventy-two and a half py s in hall beach
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i m sure you responded to my question mr speaker but i would like to know that i would like to know whether decentralization should have started right from april 1 when nunavut government came into being
speaker
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker obviously if i could have hired all the people and had them in place by april 1 then that s the ideal situation
having said that we all recognize that it wasn t possible to do that
as i indicated earlier in my response to mr o brien there are headquarters functions that are critical in trying to get up and running and there s also the issue of the positions from the decentralized model
we are trying to plan that out in as quickly a time fashions as possible so we can bring some certainty and closure to the issue
thank you
speaker interpretation
third question mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i understood your response
with the finances allocated for the py s is there money available to move these people out to the communities under the decentralization plan
is there money already allocated in the budget to move those people out to the communities

oral questions mr mclean
question 42 - 1 2
regular members input to decentralization review
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the acting premier regarding decentralization and his comments saying that the departments of executive intergovernmental affairs and cabinet are working on rearranging the model
as we know decentralization affects 10 communities and as regular members are we going to have any input into this little quirk or is it going to be dumped on us in our retreat in baker lake
speaker
two questions
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker first of all we are not planning on dumping anything on anybody in baker lake
i think what we are doing now is trying to take an assessment on what is out there and what is available and trying to outline some of the problems
thank you
speaker
thank you mr ng
third question mr mclean
mr mclean
so the acting premier is he committed to advising the rest of the people that are effected by decentralization what decisions are going to be moved so we don t go into baker lake on the retreat and no surprises
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker most definitely there is no plan to be rearranging anything at this stage just assessing what is out there and realistically what can be done right now
that is the main basis of what we are trying to assess
thank you

oral questions mr nutarak
question 43 - 1 2
infrastructure and decentralization in pond inlet
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is to mr anawak minister of community government housing & transportation
regarding staff housing the infrastructure that is being built in anticipation of decentralization in pond inlet is slated to be built this year
i wonder if that is going to go ahead
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
minister of community government housing & transportation
hon jack anawak interpretation
i am sorry would you ask him to repeat his question please
speaker interpretation
mr nutarak would you rephrase your question please
thank you
mr nutarak interpretation
there is supposed to be infrastructure built this summer in pond inlet but there may be a delay because of the land availability there or quality of it
so my question is are the plans going ahead to build the infrastructure or are those going to be delayed
there may be some problems that will not allow the construction to go ahead because the land fill site has not been restored
i don t know what the plans are to restore the land that is near where the infrastructure is happening this summer
i want a clarification of what the plans are
speaker interpretation
mr anawak that was a question directed to you
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as the acting premier i should take that because the question has to do with the broader financing and quite frankly with nunavut construction company
given the agreement that they have established with diand for constructing the office space and the housing for turnover to the nunavut government as it stands now that agreement is still in place
the nunavut construction company with the federal government is developing that same infrastructure
we have no participation in that except for when it is finalized we assume responsibility for those lease payments
but if the honourable member has some concerns about the timing on that we will certainly find out what is going on with the planned infrastructure in his community
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
maybe i should be directing this to the minister of public works
i wonder if the old land fill site is going to be restored and if it is going to be restored this coming summer
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
i would just like to inform everybody that you are supposed to be directing the same line of questioning to the same minister and if you have other questions that you should take these one by one
interpretation ends
i will ask ms thompson to answer because that was where mr nutarak directed it
ms thompson minister of public works telecommunications & technical services
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i know that there have been some funds set aside for the land fill site in pond inlet

oral questions
mr alakannuark
question 44 - 1 2
rent scale and public housing
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will direct this question to the minister of housing
my question is that the public housing units and those people who rent them the price of rent keeps going higher
i wonder if the rent scale is going to be reconsidered in the near future
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
we have not had an opportunity to look at that yet but on his concern that will be one of the topics that we ll be covering when we have discussions on housing
the lowest rent is 32 dollars and once a person becomes employed their rent goes way higher than that
so i m not sure if this is the question that he s asking about but that s one of the issues we ll be addressing during our meetings about rent scales
we have heard in the past that once a person becomes a wage earner their rents go way up and i think they start paying 30% of their wages
so we ll be looking at this in the near future
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
second question mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark
thank you mr speaker
this is a supplementary question to the same minister of housing
the rental units in the communities are becoming scarce and we have a population growth that is growing who are demanding their own housing
so the occupancy rate per unit is very high and there s been overcrowding and that causes problems
so now is it being considered that there be more public housing built in communities
thank you mr speaker
speaker
community government housing & transportation minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we would like to see the communities be self-sufficient
that s what they want to do in their hamlet
we would like to see more communities taking the initiative to provide homeownership or make more it more accessible to be a homeowner in the communities
that s what the residents of taloyoak are doing right now and we would like to see more of that in the communities
i do understand however what his question is but i m not sure if we will be obtaining more funds for us to address this issue
our colleagues in ottawa are well aware of this problem too
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr iqaqrialu
question 45 - 1 2
nursing shortage
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is directed to the minister of health and social services
in some communities especially in the smaller communities they have one nurse in their health centres that work 24 hours a day
they are only human and they should be taking rest breaks
how are these nurses going to be replaced so that they can take their break in communities
also in some communities even though they may have more than one nurse they are still short staffed in their health centres and the nurses are expected to work 24 hours a day
do you have a program whereby these people can be relieved from time to time
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker and thank you mr iqaqrialu
it was a good question
the concern right now mr speaker is not unique just to nunavut
indeed it seems to be a national problem and that is the availability of nurses and professional nursing staff
what we want to try and do from the departments point of view is to put in place a recruitment and retention program which we re working on right now
so that we ll have a pool of nurses that will be available at the community level
what we re doing at the department mr speaker is trying to get to the point where we have a number of nurses in these communities that will actually fill the void that is there right now
for example in the communities where we have two nurses that are working 12 hour shifts that is not acceptable
we realize that
i realize that
the members of the house realize that
but after saying that mr speaker the concern is to actually get nurses get them up and to have them trained hopefully locally will be one area to look at alleviating that problem
of course we don t have that right now available to us
so one of the things that we re hoping to announce over the next few weeks is the nursing program at the college so we can hire them and have locally trained nurses
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation thank you mr speaker
i think this is a major concern and i think this has become a crisis
i know that if you decide to address it quickly and treat it as a first priority i think that you can do something about that
i would like to see you deal with this as soon as possible
especially in the area of nursing shortages so that people can take comfort that if they should get ill they will be taken care of
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker yes mr speaker indeed my department and the government take the issue of shortage of nurses very serious
as i said before it s not just unique to nunavut
indeed we just heard a couple of weeks ago that mr harris of ontario was putting about 250 million dollars back into the health care system and hiring 10 000 nurses
we ve got to look at recruiting nurses from the same jurisdictions that ontario alberta british colombia and other southern provinces are looking at the same pool of people that are available
we have to look at on the recruitment and retention side what we need to put in place to maintain and retain the nurses that we have working for us
indeed many of the centres right now have what we call the nightingale nurses where they come up on contract and they work for 3 months and they go back to south
that s not providing the continuity we want to see in our communities
so i agree with the member
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i m talking about the area of nunavut
specifically i m not concerned about the rest of canada or southern canada
rather i m talking about nunavut specific issues
are you also involved in recruiting nurses for areas other than nunavut
i m concerned about filling the positions in nunavut
speaker
thank you iqaqrialu
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
i ve known mr iqaqrialu for a long time and i know that he s asking that question very seriously
nurses just don t come out of the ground
they have to be trained there s x-number of nurses available and we re competing against other jurisdictions
when we re competing against other jurisdictions to get nurses to come to the north we have to be able to offer them a good benefits package
we want to offer them good working conditions
indeed mr speaker those are all the things that we re looking at in the retention and recruitment program
mr speaker i want reiterate that i live here my wife my children my in-laws my relatives my friends we all use the same services that you do
that s what i meant by saying that we re trying to recruit nationally
we have to compete against those other jurisdictions
and it s not easy
one of the reasons why we re looking at health boards and elimination of health boards is to be able to take a nunavut perspective
so we should be hiring nurses for nunavut not for specific regions of our home
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
last and final question mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my final question
if we re just going to be recruiting from outside of nunavut i don t think that that is acceptable
but for the nunavut residents i think that we can also train health care professionals for nunavut specific jobs
i think by providing educational opportunities and training opportunities in nunavut that would stop a lot of recruiting that s happening right now in southern canada
nunavut nurses can learn to be nurses in nunavut
i think that would solve a lot of our problems
perhaps education programs or program funds should be identified by your department so we don t have to keep looking outside of nunavut to hire these people
speaker
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
mr speaker i agree with the member
earlier today i made a statement where we had nine x-ray technologist graduates here at nunavut arctic college for the first time in nunavut
i think we should be very pleased and happy about that
we have already seen the successful completion of several of our residents trained as community health representatives chr s
mr speaker we ve had an entrance program two years running now for the nursing program
at the end of that program over the next several months and years we ll have trained nurses here in nunavut
that s what i was talking about when i said we have to train people here in nunavut
that s how we will be able to hopefully supply a market for local talent
that s the way the department is looking at it and that s what we re trying to bring forth
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
i will now ask members that haven t asked questions yet to ask questions i know i have your name mr o brien but i ll allow mr akesuk to ask questions
mr akesuk oral questions
question 46 - 1 2
arctic college nursing training program
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
maybe this is directed to the minister of education
at one time at the arctic college there was a program that was getting underway at to train nurses
i wonder if the program is going to be reinstated and for that to be able to go ahead in this coming semester
speaker interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
minister of education james arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is being considered at this time because the health care students were unable to continue on with their courses
once i m able to answer your question and how the program is going to be designed and what the decision is about going ahead for this program i ll be able to answer that
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr kattuk
question 47 - 1 2
rehabilitation programs for inmates
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister of justice mr anawak
at the baffin correctional centre here in iqaluit i think that the department of justice refers to it as a warehouse where you put away people
the people who are inmates of that facility are not provided with any rehabilitative programs
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes thank you
we don t want to put our people away to warehouses especially our people
i have had meetings with the officials in the department of justice specifically in the area of correctional facilities including the one in iqaluit and the ycc in yellowknife
that s exactly what we want to do
we want to establish facilities that are more directed to the lifestyles of the geographical area that they come from
for example we re looking at young people who may be able to take programs where they can go on an out on the land training program
we are looking at these current programs in preparation to return them to local communities

my question is to the minister responsible for health mr picco
thank you
speaker
two questions for mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
what we spoke about in the committee and what we said subsequently was that under the department of health we want to put an organizational plan in place
the contract for that work to be developed over the next several weeks will be in conjunction with the department of education
i am not aware that the contract has been let - right now per se and indeed i don t know if you re allowed to actually table for example a contract to an individual whatever
the terms of reference of the contract once put in place i could commit to table that in the house if that s what the member s requesting
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
second question mr o brien
mr o brien

mr speaker i was under the impression that the contract was actually let and that the person was in place
just for clarification purposes is the minister saying that is not the case
speaker
thank you mr o brien

ajauqtiit review of draft business plans and preliminary budget information 1999/2000 main estimates
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to review the introduction and general recommendations from the standing committee of ajauqtiit
mr speaker members of ajauqtiit reviewed the draft business plan and preliminary budget information for the legislative assembly on tuesday april 27th 1999
however in this meeting the speaker in effect appeared as a minister and the clerk as a deputy minister and the members asked questions as they would of any other minister or department official
a total budget allocation for operations of the legislative assembly of nunavut is 9 million 748 thousand
in general recommendations as with other standing committees members experienced some frustration in reviewing financial print outs that were initially provided only in english
members thank the office of the legislative assembly for preparing an inuktitut more user friendly format and providing it to the members after the meeting
however in light of difficulties effecting all committees members passed the following motion
that all materials or correspondence provided by the government of nunavut departments or ministers to the members of the legislative assembly should be done in both english and inuktitut
that sufficient resources be allocated for translation services to ensure that this happens on a timely basis
mr speaker that concludes my introductory comments
i move seconded by the member from hudson bay that the report be referred to committee of the whole for consideration in concurrence with the 1999/2000 main estimates
i further seek unanimous consent to waive rule 91-4 to move the report into committee of the whole for today
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation

mr tootoo is seeking unanimous consent to waive rule 91 4 that the committee report be tabled at the committee of the whole

report 4 - 1 2
culture education & health review of draft business plans and preliminary information on the 1999/2000 main estimates
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will be reading the report on the review of draft business plans of the standing committee on culture education and health
it has seven pages
standing committee on culture education and health
review departmental performance and consider any other matter referred by the house
the standing committee has oversight responsibility for the following the department of health and social services department of education department of culture language elders and youth
introduction at the point of the standing committees review in april of 1999 the government of nunavut was only three weeks old
nevertheless in spite of it s youth the government has had to make plans and move forward quickly with the budget for the new fiscal year
much of this preparatory work was done by departments prior to march 31/99 under the leadership of the office of the interim commissioner
presentations were made by the ministers and their departmental officials to the standing committee which included draft business plans mostly developed prior to february 5th 1999
draft capital plans mostly commitments by gnwt prior to march 31 1999 and one-page budgets or main estimate summaries
members also had the opportunity to ask questions to obtain further details and some departments provided additional information following the hearings
as this is the first time that the standing committees have performed this review function members have some questions and recommendations about the process for all three departments
general recommendations to all departments the need for detailed and realistic plans and long term goals
the standing committee is concerned with setting up expectations that may not be met due to limitations in our financial or human resources
at the same time the standing committee appreciated the efforts of the departments which outlined longer term strategic goals and objectives even up to twenty years
footprints it is unclear from the presentations to the standing committee what directions the departments have received regarding the recommendations that are in the footprints documents prepared by the nunavut implementation commission
there appears to be some inconsistency as the departments are fulfilling some footprints recommendations but not fulfilling others
is there a list of principles or criteria by which departments are making decisions
recommendation
that the government of nunavut generally implement the recommendations of footprints unless there are good reasons for pursuing an alternate course of action and these reasons are publicly outlined
decentralization
footprints recommended a decentralized government
the office of the interim commissioner reviewed these recommendations and in october 1998 made a public commitment for a number of decentralized positions under different departments to go to specific communities
it is unclear from the presentations to the standing committees as to what the plans are for these decentralized positions
which communities will have which positions and what is the expected time frame for these positions to be established
furthermore how will the services that have been contracted back to the gnwt be integrated into the decentralization plan
recommendation
that the government of nunavut departments provide the standing committee with detailed plans regarding the decentralization by community by position and with time frames
where the departments are proposing to take an alternate course of action than in footprints or to the 1998 public statement on decentralized positions a review of alternative options and compelling reasons should be provided to the standing committee
inuit qaujimanituqangit
all departments stated a commitment to making inuit qaujimanituqangit a cornerstone of the new government and under the office of the interim commissioner this was a component of both division and the goals of governance of the new government
however it was disappointing that no department presented a clear articulation of what this means
as noted below the standing committee embraces the involvement of the communities and elders in policy development and program delivery as two components ensuring a culturally sensitive government built on inuit traditions and inuit ways of doing things
members also welcome the commitment by the cabinet to making inuktitut the working language of the cabinet and the government and various initiatives proposed for the departments to increase the capacity of the staff to speak and understand inuktitut
members do not want the government of nunavut to take that risk
members welcome this beginning and encourage a collective effort to build on it
recommendation
that the cabinet build a strong policy statement about their commitment to inuit qaujimanituqangit as the foundation of the government of nunavut
community input and support
as noted above all departments spoke of their commitment in making inuit qaujimanituqangit a foundation of their work however there are very few details as to how this will happen
the standing committee welcomes the stated commitments to work with our communities
members of the standing committees believe that if the departments truly utilize the communities needs first in making decisions about policy or programs that they will be utilizing the community heritage as well as traditional knowledge
however even when the departments give an example of community bodies and organizations that they wish to work with in the future few details were provided as to how this would happen
the standing committee notes that the gnwt government had a stated commitment to community empowerment and in the past they negotiated the transfer of responsibilities to some communities in nunavut
this support should provide the appropriate co-ordination and administrative support physical facility support and compensation for the elders work it seems clear that the department of culture language elders & youth does not have enough funding for this task
as well they should support women elders by using the status of women funding these are but to name a few
that the departments develop detailed plans for integrating elders in policy development and program delivery within their mandate sharing of information in the budget review process
that the departments should provide mid-year progress reports that would be reviewed by the standing committee in october of this year 1999
they should include detailing the programs which have been initiated to date they should outline specific expenditures to date and entitlements and providing information on plans for the remaining fiscal year

this department is a central agency which provides a wide range of services to the entire government in areas such as recruitment training and development job evaluation and labour relations
there was no equivalent department in the previous government prior to the division
the department of human resources has a close relationship with the department of finance and administration which manages the payroll system and participates in collective bargaining
the centralized approach to the delivery of human resource programs reflects the fact that the nunavut government is a relatively small organization the 99/2000 budget for the department of human resources is just over 10 million dollars
the largest component of the budget is removals to and from the community of employment and recruitment at about 6 3 million dollars
the remainder of the budget is divided amongst the directorate policy and planning staffing policy and an assistant deputy ministers division which includes regional offices labour relations training and development and job evaluation/organizational design
the department has no capital funding in its budget
to carry out the activities of the department we currently have in place seventeen employees at headquarters and four in the regions
i am pleased to tell you that 68% of the staff are inuit
hiring for the baffin regional office in igloolik will not take place until office space and staff housing are available
current plans call for infrastructure to be available in 2000
the regional human resource services will be handled out of head quarters operation until then
the departments first priority is staffing up its own operation and providing centralized recruiting services to other departments who are doing the same thing
the biggest challenge we will face over the coming years is the renewal of the collective agreements
the two unions the federation of nunavut teachers and the nunavut employees union have both served notice to commence negotiations
finally i expect the department to be a positive force in promoting a stable and representative work force that reflects the values and the vision of our government
mr chairman i would be happy to answer any questions that the members may have
thank you
chairperson interpretation

the main estimates summary provided to the committee indicated a total of 1999/2000 expenditures of $10 835 523 00
the committee again recognizes the central agency function of the department and has the following brief comments and observations
on competency based human resource systems the departments draft business plan stresses the need to remove artificial academic requirements in its job evaluation system
the competency-based system is intended to help achieve the inuit employment plan of the government
the committee is supportive of efforts designed to maximize inuit employment in government and looks forward to regular updates in government wide progress in that area
the committee looks forward to receiving information on progress in this area
in regards to labour relations the committee was informed that the department has not yet staffed the position of director of labour relations
the committee was advised that when the position is staffed the department will be able to start developing a strategy in this area

the committee was advised that departments are currently in the process of having their organizational charts receive final approval

any questions or comments o brien
thank you mr chairman
i don t have any general comments but i do have a i guess a general question mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr ng do you have a response please
hon kelvin ng
yes thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the government of nunavut the cabinet hasn t tasked any specific minister or any department right now with the lead on the whole decentralization issue
it is within the prerogative of the premier right now and executive right now by the mere fact that it has not been passed on to anybody specifically
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien i have a hard time remembering your name but go ahead
mr o brien
it is okay mr chairman you can call me what ever you feel is appropriate
i have been called many names
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien your response mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman obviously we have a critical role in respect of supporting the departments wherever they may be in recruiting for their positions
that is the centralized support that this department provides and also in respect to holding the benefits of the relocation of the new employees and the development of staffing
so those are the key areas
the provision of being involved in the acquisition of the staff housing as well
those responsibilities lie within this department
that is the critical support that we will provide to for the decentralization of government positions
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr o brien
in reference to training for decentralized jobs
what is the status on your training plan
chairperson interpretation
mr minister would you respond to that
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
i am told that right now through the involvement of the nuhrds strategy that there are forty two individuals who are funded under that program or within our system
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien go ahead
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
hon kelvin ng thank you mr chairman that may well be why the premier hasn t assigned maybe he feels because it is broader and the importance of the issue that he is holding it himself
we haven t got into that debate yet and obviously everybody recognizes the importance of the issue so i will certainly relay that back to him
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister and mr o brien
at this time mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
my name is not pokniknak it is puqiqnak
mr chairman thank you
the minister stated this morning that there would be a liquor outlet in uqsuqtuq and there was a comment made that we would not want to be a liquor outlet based in uqsuqtuq
looking at the employment looking at how employment effects the community i would like you to clarify whether this liquor warehouse is going to be based where this liquor warehouse is going to be based
whether it is if they don t want it in uqsuqtuq which other communities are you looking at
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
the minister would like to answer that question hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman mr chairperson i may have erred earlier in my answer to my question
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr puqiqnak i believe you have another question
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
that s the understanding that i got from reading the report
i would like everyone out there to understand that
it is not going to be the liquor warehouse that is going to base there it is the liquor licensing board that would be there
we have been getting the proper information out to our community in that regard
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
at this time we are not we are on the issue of human resources
let us stick to the item we are not talking about the liquor licensing board here
that is for your information
mr puqiqnak do you have another comment to make
mr puqiqnak interpretation
well i am not trying to talk about liquor or liquor licensing board i just wanted to get the proper information out there so that there is not any misunderstanding i just wanted to make that clarification
i just wanted to get the people the proper information
chairperson interpretation well you could have got that information out in a brief comment because of course when you start debating you tend to spend a long time
ok any comments
irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
my friend down there at the witness table
i did pose a question earlier but i would like to ask again because in his opening comments he said that the baffin regional office in igloolik will not take place until office space and houses are available
when i posed my question earlier you didn t give any direct response but my question was whether this could have taken place on april 1 with the creation of nunavut
with the relocation dollars for staff what is going to be happening now with that money that was earmarked for our relocating staff to igloolik
chairperson interpretation
thank you
we talked about that this morning
regarding the igloolik school mr minister if you would respond to that question
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
we couldn t have had it up and running on april 1 because there wasn t a department in the gnwt so there was no positions established for april 1
thank you
chairperson interpretation
i believe mr irqittuq has another question
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you
i realize that they re in one pot of money but is it possible to reserve those dollars so that they can generate interest
chairperson interpretation
thank you
if you would respond to that question mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman if there were to be a surplus within that expenditure of this department or any other department that would be reassessed at that time to see where other needs may develop
as it stands now that is the allocation that is within the budget and until we get into operations we won t know if it is sufficient or insufficient
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr irqittuq any further questions
thank you for your response mr minister
any other items
maybe later
thank you mr irqittuq for forgetting your question
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
in regards to human resources i would like to make a comment
the larger communities will of course have employment positions and there are the smaller communities that have been asking for employment positions
i think we have a tendency to forget about the smaller communities and dollars are not allocated for the smaller communities
what kind of plan do you have so that the smaller communities like pelly bay or repulse bay are included in these decentralization plans
i would like clarification on this point
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr minister your response please
hon kelvin ng
well mr chairperson i don t know if i can respond to that question
it is not because i don t want to it is because of the fact that this government is working with the decentralization plan that the nunavut implementation commission proposed and it was modified through the interim commissioners office
we know that it didn t take into account every single community it tried to focus on establishing functional government offices in several locations
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
i don t believe that s a question
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
first of all i would like to ask about those communities that were going to get decentralized positions
their infrastructure has been built already but some of the building materials have still not been getting into the communities
will they be going into the communities this year on sealift
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson as i think i answered to mr nutarak on nunavut construction
they re responsible with the federal government for developing housing and staff office space for the decentralized model and at the same time we ll probably ask for an update on the overall timetable for finishing those facilities and that infrastructure
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr akesuk i think you have another question
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr minister you want to respond
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
yes that goes back to the whole basis of the decentralized discussion that took place earlier today and over the past
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
do you have another question mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
mr minister the communities will have to receive those decentralized py s and they are going to need office space and staff housing and we want to see more positions decentralized from the government
i wonder if there has been additional training provided to those people who are slated to be moved to the communities
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr ng if you wish to respond to that
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
i believe that i indicated earlier that under the nunavut unified human resource development strategy which everyone call nuhrds there are several programs that have been funded under that to develop inuit training and career advancement
there is public service career training programs nunavut senior assignment program executive master of business administration program executive secretarial training there s been media communications training and there has also been the nunavut government student employment
so there are various programs that have been funded to try and bring up the level of experience and skills overall throughout nunavut
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
i think those are all the questions you have
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairperson
i don t know if this is your department or not so correct me if it isn t
a two bedroom apartment they get for i think the figure is 1200 dollars a month and the utilities are paid for
in a place like baker lake and arviat possibly rankin inlet you can check that it s different too
there was leases signed in the previous government that had to come over according to the nunavut act
so you have people in rankin inlet in private accommodations that are paying 2 thousand to 2 500 dollars a month for accommodations
is the minister committed to i don t know if this is his department to making it fair equitable and transparent like we have been told
to make sure that government employees are all treated the same whether they are in iqaluit or pelly bay or baker lake or repulse bay or coral harbour
thank you
chairperson interpretation
minister ng i think you can clarify that question
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman the department of human resources is involved in the allocation of staff housing units and also in the review and development of policies regarding staff housing
the department of public works telecommunications & technical services is involved in the actual leasing portion of that
but yes i am aware of the discrepancies between headquarters and regional staff in some of the regional centres and we are going to try and bring some consistency to the whole issue
it is as you indicated a bit complex there are some units and leases that we have inherited from the gnwt there are others that we inherited from the oic
so there s different factors that have to be taken into consideration
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr mclean you have more questions
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
something that has come up in the last few months and we are a small territory spread out over a vast distance
we talked about this in other matters in regard to conflict of interest and the misunderstandings that people have
my fear is that if we are not very vigilant that direct appointments may come back to haunt us
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr minister would you respond to that
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson cabinet is the only legal mechanism that can appoint individuals directly into positions of this government
so there are certain criteria that have to be met before direct appointments can be made
i don t have that with me here but as it is cabinet and the executive it is probably the premiers responsibility under eia i might be wrong if it is in the hr responsibility i will find out
if it is eia they can provide that information
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr mclean you can go ahead and ask another question
mr mclean
this will be my last one mr chairman for now
thank you
thank you
chairperson interpretation thank you mr mclean
mr ng do you have a comment to make to that
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
you meant for all of the departments of government i take it
yes
we will see what we can provide in a summary form
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr tootoo iqaluit centre you have the floor
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
just a few questions to follow up on mr mclean about the organizational chart
have all departments have finalized organizational charts at this time
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
i am told we don t have all of them in yet from all of the departments
thank you
chairperson interpretation
go ahead mr tootoo you have another question
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i m not sure if the minister understood i wasn t asking if he had received them i was asking if all departments had finalized approved organizational charts for each of their departments
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
i think mr minister you can provide a better response to that
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson it is probably more appropriate when they come up about their specific organizational chart
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo you can continue
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
the minister indicated in his opening remarks that they have 17 employees in headquarters and four in the regions
does he have an organizational chart for his department that has been finalized and if so out of that 17 or those 21 positions at what levels are they staffed at right now
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
i would just like to say at this point that we are conducting our affairs in inuktitut so if i say boss or president i am struggling with minister so if i say boss or president i mean minister
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you i like boss
anyway yes we have an approved org chart with 47 positions and 17 filled out of 47
thank you
chairperson interpretation
you have another one mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i have a number more but one more on this topic is does the minister have an idea of a time frame in which his department will be staffed to its full capacity
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister boss ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
i can t say for sure i mean obviously there is a priority right now because we are one of the departments that provides the human resource support for the other departments
so cabinet has recognized it as a priority in trying to get this as one of the departments to try and get staffed up first and we are trying to do that
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you boss ng
i also want you to know when i say minister i am trying to speak english
i think irqittuq you wanted to ask another question
go ahead
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
the minister at the witness table i have some more questions to ask of him
will they need to have the same qualifications as the ones hired in iqaluit or has there been some consideration given to experience or equivalencies
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq your question is in order
minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman it was raised earlier and our goal is to staff as many positions as possibly based on competency on being able to do the job not so much on the technical qualifications of those individuals
that is where the department is moving the whole government of nunavut so your evaluation is based more on being able to do the job more than your technical background
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
i think you have another question mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
the jobs which will be advertised and so no matter where the jobs are will you be looking at the residents first before hiring outside of the community
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister ng did you want to respond to that
hon kelvin ng
yes mr chairperson
yes most definitely if the positions can be filled locally that would be the first priority
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
are there any other comments or questions under human resources while the minister is at the witness table
mr mclean go ahead i apologize mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman my question is in relationship to pay equity
i am just wondering if the minister can give us an update as to where this issue stands in relation to implementing a gender neutral job evaluation system for the new nunavut government
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister ng you may respond please
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman the collective agreement that was reached by the gnwt with their employees which transferred over to the nunavut government and the nunavut based employees was a gender neutral classification it took that into account
so all the positions that were transferred to nunavut after division came over with the new job evaluation method and the new hay plan as well
in addition to that the newly created positions for headquarters whether it is in iqaluit we are all being evaluated using that plan as well
so it is all gender neutral
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien further comments
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
are things kosher are we anticipating any problems with this system that we have inherited
chairperson interpretation
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
it is our understanding that at this point in time there are not problems with the new job evaluation system
i believe there is some mechanism for an appeal system for those individuals who feel that they were not properly categorized within certain pay ranges
but generally broadly across the board most of the problems are gone we feel
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien would you like to ask another question
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson my final question is in reference to the affirmative action policy
if you could give the members a brief update as to where this issue stands with your department chairperson interpretation
minister ng either you or one of your officials could respond ms aglukkaaq
thank you mr chairperson the affirmative action policy was transferred over to the government of nunavut
there were minor revisions to it and we have incorporated the article 23 inuit beneficiary preference as priority one under the policy
so any recruitment plans that we have in place individuals are required to identify whether they are beneficiaries of the claim or not to be considered into any positions
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you very much mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you
any other questions or comments to the department of human resources
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
my question relates to an issue that was mentioned earlier
i was wondering if the minister could advise as to how many positions that the government has staffed through the open competition process and how many have been staffed via the direct appointment process
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng or one of your officials can reply
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i don t know the total numbers that had been staffed i can tell you that there s only been two direct appointment made by this cabinet
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo would you like to make another comment
m tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i wonder if the minister would advise us of the circumstances that allowed the department to hire or fill those positions without using the open competition process and advertising those positions to all the people of nunavut
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
yes because those two individuals completed their management training program with arctic college and had a specific interest actually in the department of finance that s why i know those two individuals
thank you
if i may add those two positions are targeted for decentralization to one of the communities when they complete their training as will thank you
chairperson
interpretation
mr tootoo you may go ahead and ask your question
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
another issue that was raised earlier in regards to the last question about affirmative action
how does the department rate their someone that is a long term resident that may not be a beneficiary of nunavut but was born here and lived here all their lives
will those individuals still receive preferential treatment under the affirmative action program
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman on the affirmative action policy they would be designated priority through category
thank you
chairperson
interpretation
thank you mr ng
questions or comments mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
i was listening to mr tootoo through translation but it s okay
in regards to human resources when we discuss this matter i just remembered that we ve been thinking about the article 23
after the nunavut government had been established we have to utilize and do our business according to article 23
we ve heard much that after the nunavut government was established we now have to do things according to the article 24 and we should be prioritising or we should be contracting people from within nunavut
it seems quite embarrassing although we had worked very hard but it s quite embarrassing because we are not utilizing the article 23
we have to do something according to article 23 and 24 because we have to abide by those articles
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
right now i want the members to be aware that i am now using clyde river dialect
mr ng you may respond now
in regards to your question seems like your question should be directed to the minister of health and social services
mr ng you could respond to it if you d like
hon kelvin ng
minister i ll let them
when his budget comes up it s probably more appropriate
>>applause
chairperson interpretation
mr puqiqnak i think he answered your questions do you have any further comments
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank your mr chairman in regards to human resources i thought we were dealing with human resources
as nunavut residents should have employment opportunities and we should also be contracting nunavut residents
i feel that nunavut should be contracting that boarding home from within nunavut but in regards to the minister of health i know the minister for that department but i was trying to talk more in line of employment
i wanted to ask you a question because we would like to do things according to article 23
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
department of human resources minister ng would you like to respond
thank you
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the member makes a good point but the department of human resources is responsible for hiring for the government departments and providing training opportunities for the residents of nunavut and particularly employees as well
i think that members questions are better probably raised when public works telecommunications comes up in respect of contracting provisions of article 24
when the department of health and social services boards comes up in respect to that same provision with the contracts that were let by the board
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
the clock is ticking and we ve got a few issues to cover mr akesuk

thank you mr ng
mr tootoo your questions
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
in regards to staff housing policy and the allocations of staff housing units under the previous government that was a responsibility for the financial management board that contracted to the nwt housing corporation
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
interpretation
thank you mr tootoo mr ng or aglukkaq
ms aglukkaq
qujannamiik itsivautaa
it differs between regions
in kitikmeot there s a committee that allocates the units for government units and that s with human resources financial management board public works
in the keewatin it s a combination and there s also been contracts to maintain the units outside of government
in the baffin i believe with housing corporation that arrangement to maintain the government inventory of units was contracted to the housing authority
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
interpretation
thank you ms aglukkaaq
mr tootoo do you have any other questions
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i am aware of that process and how it works and i was just more or less wondering now is that still in place or is there a different method of allocating and who s responsible now
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng or ms aglukkaaq
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i believe that i indicated that the allocations policy all those procedures carried over after april 1st and we haven t changed to date but it is subject to review right now

mr ng or ms aglukkak
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman there s two different processes
the two different processes from what i am understand are a regional allocation committee and a headquarters allocation committee
that s where some of the differences might be coming into play
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr minister i think it does explain this as you said earlier that the same process was being followed
there was only one committee that was allocating units prior to april 1st and now it appears as you mentioned you have two separate committees allocating units
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
i don t think your looking at any other response now mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman well before april 1st my understanding is the oic had an allocation committee and gnwt had a regional allocation committee
so after april 1st that s where you end up with the two committees
i mean those are the kind of things that we re trying to streamline in the development of a new government of nunavut policy in relation to staff housing thank you
chairperson
interpretation
thank you mr ng
is that end of your time mr tootoo
thank you mr tootoo any further comments or questions
go back to line by line these have to be passed 4 - 4 under human resource chart and this is the directorate for the 1999/2000 operations and maintenance budget
i believe you re looking at the page 4 - 4 operations and maintenance
the total operations and maintenance budget
again i read this as $ 687 00 i believe this is $ 687 thousand dollars are there any comments to the amounts
all the members have agreed thank you
capital items total capital nothing so the total expenditures for the directorate is $ 687 for those in agreement
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
i just want to ask mr chairman the minister made a short comment as he was doing his introductory statements that the human resources he stated that there were no capital purchases in the total human resources portfolio
should we even mention capital when there s no purchases or no budget for capital items
chairperson interpretation
are you following the same book
i ve been told that although there is no amount in these slots we still have to refer to them because again that s part of the government protocol
the total expenditures for the directorate is 687 thousand dollars you agree 4 - 5 policy and planning operations and maintenance budget in total is $ 116 thousand dollars not much agreed
for total capital the total expenditures and there is no total capital so therefore the total expenditures for policy and planning is $ 116 thousand are you agreed good
are you agreed you guys agreed before you even ask for the agreement
thank you
4 - 7 assistant deputy minister operations and maintenance total operation and maintenance 3 million 780 thousand
are you agreed mr tootoo did you make a comment to this item

arviat p3 project
hon hon kelvin ng
mr speaker i am very pleased to announce that the government of nunavut has signed a public-private partnership agreement with the arviat development corporation for the health facility in arviat
this is the first p3 project agreement in nunavut and the northwest territories
public-private partnerships are a financing alternative in which the government partners with a private sector business to provide some of the government s infrastructure needs
the private business invests in the project and then enters into an operating lease with the government
in today s dollars this project is worth approximately ten 10 million dollars
mr speaker i would like to thank the adc and their representatives who are in the gallery today for their co-operation and support in moving the process forward and ensuring that the agreement met the interests of the community
mr guy alikut ms cleo prellwitz and mr joe manik
they deserve great credit in bringing this much needed health centre to arviat
it is expected that the design work for the health centre will be completed by the end of may with the construction schedule to begin early this fall
this agreement is significant because it lays the foundation for future p3 projects in nunavut
it was important that the standards were high the gn received good value the agreement would meet the auditor general s guidelines for an operating lease and that the interests of the community were best served
we believe that all of this has been achieved in this agreement

hon hon ed picco interpretation
thank you mr speaker english i want to take this opportunity to reinforce the earlier comments made by minister ng
this agreement officially launches the work on a new health centre in arviat which should be ready early in the year 20000
this is an important project and has been one of my department s highest priorities
it is the first of four health facilities on the government s list of possible p3 projects and i look forward to seeing progress made on those projects in the near future

cbc and consensus government
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
listening to the c b c this morning i understand that the media have started to refer to members on this side of the house as nunavut s opposition
a pretty snap decision considering that this is only our sixth day in this session
it took god a full week to create the world
i guess the media needs less time to define this assembly
>>applause
hear hear
the term opposition suggests discord for the sake of appearing different attacking to score cheap political points
mr speaker the regular members of the assembly have made very clear their desire to work with the government to make nunavut a better place for all
to be consulted and to have input on the issues facing us all
it s simply not correct to suggest that we have something to gain by acting as knee jerk opposition to anything the government says or does
that s not opposition mr speaker that s accountability
there is a big difference
thank you

need for school buses in iqaluit
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise to make a statement on the issue of school busing here in iqaluit
as the members are aware the population of iqaluit is increasing as more and more public servants are moving to iqaluit
they move to iqaluit with their families
mr speaker next year the new middle school will open at the top of the hill but the two elementary schools will still be bursting at the seams with new students
while the numbers of classrooms is increasing we have to consider the other services for which there will also be an increased demand such as school bussing
mr speaker i want to make the point that these are examples of forced growth
the money allocated for services such as school bussing has to keep up with the demand due to more students
to give members a sense of the problem one bus for the middle school can hold forty four students per trip
currently i believe there are one hundred and seventy seven or one hundred and seventy five students enrolled at the middle school of which one hundred and sixty of them will require bussing
so with one bus to service those students that bus would have to make four trips in the morning eight trips during lunch hour and four trips in the afternoon just to handle the middle school
mr speaker next year there is funding for two busses which is the current level right now two busses and one handicapped bus for the three schools
this is not enough
i know the minister of education shares the concern that the budget must reflect forced growth issues and perhaps his department more than others is impacted by the increasing numbers
in this case the number of students
but communities such as iqaluit and other decentralized communities that will be facing the same problem cannot be expected to absorb the impact of forced growth
the government of nunavut must consider it in their locations of funding communities

yesterday i posed a question in respect to community government the minister of community government

question 51 - 1 2
boarding home contract
mr o brien
mr speaker my question is directed to the minister responsible for health and social services and it involves the recent rewarding of a contract regarding the ublivik centre
thank you mr o brien minister picco
thank you mr speaker
for clarity mr speaker if you would bear with me i would like to give a background on the reason for the r f p and a chronological sequence of events on the r f p
to help answer the question to hopefully put more light on this contract award the keewatin health and social services board has historically contracted with eastgate inuit enterprises to provide boarding home facilities and patient transportation in winnipeg
in december of 1998 the keewatin health and social services board requested a request for proposals in other words an r f p for patient boarding facilities and transportation services in winnipeg
they did this rather than negotiating a contract with the current service provider for the following reasons
the formal contract between the health board and the deliverer of the boarding home services expired in 1995
now since 1995 mr speaker the provision of services has been by a verbal arrangement a verbal arrangement only to operate under the same terms and conditions as outlined in the expired contract
both parties had concerns with the terms and conditions of said verbal arrangements
as well as in 1996/1997 and again in 1998 the board had directed the chief executive officer of the keewatin health and social services board to issue an r f p
following up on this mr speaker an r f p was issued closing at 3 00 p m central standard time march 18 1999
a committee reviewed the proposals in rankin inlet on april 14 1999 and selected t c
enterprises
now mr speaker the board s evaluation team was charged with determining which of the proposals provided the best value
the team had to weigh many factors including the cost to the taxpayers the quality of service to be provided and the implementation of article 24
t c
enterprises satisfied the board evaluation team that it could provide the quality of services of our patients and families at a price the government can afford
mr speaker following up on the second part of the question by mr o brien the contract will take effect on july 1 1999
thank you mr speaker

thank you mr speaker

thank you mr speaker
mr speaker that partly answered my question
i will try to make it a little more clear

thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr o brien
mr picco minister of health and social services
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker no indeed there was other circumstances involving the awarding of the contract as i tried to explain the cost was a mitigating factor but was not the only factor involved in the awarding of the contract
there are several other aspects as i explained earlier in my question there was the benefit to the community article 24 and so on
the cost was not one of the mitigating factors solely there were other factors involved in the review process done by the keewatin regional health and social services board and the people that reviewed the award made in rankin

mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker just a follow up with the member from hudson bay s question to the minister responsible for housing
mr speaker yesterday i tabled documents in the house the interim report from the house of commons standing committee on aboriginal affairs and northern development
the issues it dealt with specifically was a lack the need for better housing in northern isolated communities one of those issues

we have received that report we appreciate the work of this committee because they re working on our behalf
as the nunavut government and my department is responsible for housing we will do everything we can to bring nunavut up to par in terms of the need for housing

thank you mr speaker

thank you mr tootoo
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i m sorry it probably got lost in the translation we re very concerned about people who currently don t have housing and those people who are unable to afford to get their own housing
we re also concerned about future needs for the younger generation and we re also looking at other ways like what they re trying to do in taloyoak they re concentrating on homeownership
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr alakannuark
question 57 - 1 2
high cost of living in nunavut
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
perhaps i will address this question to the minister of transportation
the goods available in nunavut right now are very costly are you looking for ways to cut down the cost of living especially in the area of food
speaker interpretation
hon jack anawak interpretation yes thank you the cost of living housing food clothing and heavier goods that have to be flown to the north are too expensive
the federal government provides subsidies that are worth about $15 million dollars and part of that subsidy goes to nunavut and we had some discussions with diand on how we should be spending the subsidy
because the member is asking about all areas of the cost of living i can only assure the member that we ll be reviewing this further and looking at how more programs can be subsidized
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
second question mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation

mr mclean oral questions
question 58 - 1 2
request for proposals - ublivik contract
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the minister of health regarding the awarding of the ublivik contract
can the minister tell me how many companies had proposals
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr picco minister of health and social services
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i believe there were 4 companies
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question again to the minister
mr minister if the lowest price was not the deciding factor in the awarding of the rfp on the ublivik contract can you please briefly tell me what were the deciding factors on this contract
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker mr speaker cost was one of the factors as explained earlier in the oral question to mr o brien
the rfp was put out by the keewatin regional health and social services board
there are other factors that were looked into and i had mentioned some of them article 24 for an example the quality of service with the proposal itself
i guess it s safe to say that the contract after it was reviewed again by pws with the department of health and social services and justice the contract award seemed to serve the people of nunavut and keewatin region
as well the proposal was sound and i think the fact is that other than prices was the quality of the service of facilities the people involved to deliver the service
the other factors are in rfp which are public knowledge because those were requested in the ad
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
mr minister the company that had the contract provided service to the residents of keewatin for over 20 years was that in any way at all taken into account by whoever awarded this contract
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker if you would like to answer the question i could no no
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i think the government of nunavut the people of nunavut recognize that mrs penner for several years has done a very good job and dedicated herself to taking care of the residents of the keewatin region
i can understand why there would be some disappointment that another contractor has been selected
this is done through an rfp as i explained i went through the process which the keewatin health and social services board undertook which they did thoroughly and fairly and i m confident of that proposal
so i understand the experience and the dedication of mrs penner
i think it s just when the rfp came forward the criteria was set out and everyone was on an equal footing
the keewatin regional health and social services board picked the contractor that the final contract was awarded to based on the criteria that was in place
it was a fair sound process and i understand there would be disappointment from the person who had run the contract for several years
as i explained earlier the contract was holdover since 1995 it was a verbal commitment
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
mr o brien
mr o brien

can the minister tell me who finally signed off this contract

question 62 - 1 2
sanikiluaq interpreters for assembly
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i wanted to ask the minister of culture language elders & youth mr havioyak
the first year that we were here
perhaps i should make a comment first
i don t want to lose my own dialect or my language and to make everybody understand what i am saying i will be using a dialect that is not my own
i value my own dialect
i spoke to the minister earlier this year that perhaps we should hire an interpreter from sanikiluaq once in a while
i am going to have to borrow dialects to be understood here i know that if i used my own dialect that minister would not understand what i am trying to say
i wonder if you have been told about that before that we need to have the sanikiluaq dialect interpreted here at the house
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you
this is one of the responsibilities of the legislative assembly so i will have a talk with the clerk of the legislative assembly about that
oral questions
mr mclean
question 63 - 1 2
status of positions with education boards
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the minister of education mr arvaluk
in regards to the phasing out of the education boards and the news release the boards will be phased out during the next year and no jobs are expected
mr minister could you please give me details where the 12 people employed in the board office in baker lake will be employed next year
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes the policy objective which we achieved through the cabinet is a no lay-off policy
if a divisional board office is in baker lake then the employees will be in baker lake
there is no plan for kitikmeot and kivalliq to move there headquarters regional offices somewhere else only in the baffin is the regional office to be relocated to pangnirtung
everywhere else we have no plans to relocate the staff if the relocation isn t necessary
however i would like to add for the member that because of the divisional boards elimination plan we will probably require less administration and financial personnel
the premier has indicated that as soon as possible we will start placing some of these unnecessary positions after july 1 2000 we will start placing them immediately elsewhere within the government
that may not be required after july 1 2000
in this case if you have excess in the area of administration and finance sections of the divisional boards in baker lake then they will be invited to seek similar positions within the nunavut government
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question again for the minister
could the minister give me a time line as to when these employees can be advised of their options
they are all long term residents of baker lake and have families and mortgages to deal with
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr speaker we are in the process i hope sometime this week or next week i will be able to announce the implementation co-ordinator
as soon as we get those organized hopefully within a month we will be able to advise the staff as to the most suitable or best way to deal with it
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
mr o brien
question 64 - 1 2
vacant decentralization infrastructure
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question concerns decentralization
since we don t have a minister in charge of decentralization i will pose my question to the minister of public works telecommunications & technical services
mr speaker we spent millions and millions of dollars in some of our communities constructing office buildings and accommodations
in some cases houses have been completed and boarded up for the winter
these buildings have been heated but empty
we have a number of people i believe there are seven people at least that have been hired and waiting to take up office accommodations unfortunately the building s not available
we are also told that there are no phones available northwestel is not able to hook the phones up until august
my question mr speaker is when can we expect to get some solid confirmation as to when these buildings can be used so we can get on with the business of decentralization and running this government
speaker interpretation
minister thompson
hon manitok thompson
this is a question to the finance minister
my department is on track with the buildings we are just a service department so i will refer that question to the finance minister who is more involved in the decentralized model of the government
thank you
speaker
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker and i thank my colleague for referring the question to me
i think in yesterday s committee debates on the departments of finance & administration and human resources that issue came up
several members had questioned the timing and availability of staff housing and office space in their communities to accommodate some of these decentralized positions
i understand that some assets are in the stage right now of being transferred to the government of nunavut
but it is my understanding that as of today that we don t have any of those units within our jurisdiction but it is in process
thank you
speaker
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it is my understanding and again i am not sure but some of these units are actually turned over
so i would ask the minister if he could give me a firmer time line as i have said we have staff that have been hired
we have people that are waiting to move in they don t have accommodations
so if you could at least give me a date when i could tell these people back home when they could move into these accommodations that we may be paying for even as we speak
so if you could give me some date that i could bring back home to the people
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as i said i don t know i don t have the specific details here
possibly the deputy minister of public works telecommunications & technical services who was involved in the lease negotiations may have more specific detailed information
if he doesn t i will certainly make a point of finding out as soon as possible
thank you speaker
mr o brien mr o brien
one last point mr speaker
in reference to the concern over phone systems i would hope that is not the case where we would have to wait for northwestel until august to hook up the phone systems in our office complex
this is more a comment if the minister could look into that to see if it could be corrected
thank you
speaker
mr ng
mr o brien a comment when you are asking oral questions you have to make sure you are asking the same question you are changing the question now thank you
question 65 - 1 2
disease prevention incidence of illness
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister of health & social services
the communities see a lot more illness nowadays in their communities
what can be done in nunavut for the prevention of serious illness
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
minister of health & social services mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
i wonder if the member could rephrase his question
speaker
mr picco please listen
this is a question for the minister of health
mr alakannuark could you please clarify your question
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is for the minister of health
more and more people are getting serious illnesses in communities
maybe the problems are caused by food contamination in the food chain or from the environment
would it be possible to monitor the reasons why more people are getting sick in the communities
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
minster of health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker over the past several weeks now we have heard for example the first instances of diabetes are being seen more prevalently
one of the factors that the medical people are telling us is that with the changing patterns and lifestyles of the people of nunavut indeed one main factor would be the diets
as an example as we have gotten away from eating more country foods and we are now eating more processed foods we seem to have more instances of heart problems diabetes as i earlier said
indeed the rates of cancer have increased
right now in nunavut under the department of health we really don t have the capacity to track individual diseases and so forth we are actually contracting back some of these service
the department of health has been monitoring through the regional health boards the different instances and rates of the different diseases
one of the factors for the changing patterns of health and the new instances of different diseases has been the changes in lifestyle and the changes in consumption of food products as one example

hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i will do my opening comments for the public works and after i do my comments i ll go down to the witness chair with my officials
thank you mr chairman for the opportunity to make some introductory remarks on the business plan as it relates to the budget for the department of public works telecommunications and technical services
this covers the time period of 1999 and 2000
the main estimates for the department are divided as follows
$67 1 million for o & m
$5 7 million for capital
although there are a number of headquarter positions that remain to be filled the department has well established regional offices in baffin keewatin and kitikmeot regions
out of the 108 positions in the regional operations in the larger communities a total of 40 are staffed by inuit
this represents 37% of the workforce in the department
all regional public works telecommunications and technical services offices are ensuring that services are being provided without interruption while the headquarters positions are bring staffed
the services provided are purchasing and contracting
building maintenance and the delivery of petroleum products
the department is contracting services from the department of public works and services gnwt
this will fill the gap in skills until they are developed in nunavut
the decentralization plan for the department is proceeding
this is scheduled to begin in the year 2000 as additional housing and office space becomes available
there are now a total of 46 housing units and 3 office buildings completed
these are located in communities in all three regions where regional offices will be located
the department also manages the petroleum products revolving fund
this fund i strictly for the financing of fuel inventory and operating expenses and is recovered through the pricing structure
public works also manages a large budget on behalf of client departments who are constructing buildings as part of their capital plan
the department provides a high degree of services in order to ensure the necessary requirements are met
the department also intends to review the standards and criteria used to determine capital expenditures
the intent will be to designing criteria that meet the specific needs of nunavut
all interested parties will be contracted for input including the mlas through the standing committees
current criteria were carried over from the gnwt in order to ensure that some standards were in place until a review
central purchasing is also a major task handled by the department
this represents a significant opportunity for nunavuts businesses to develop and grow
the department ensures contracts and purchases meet all the requirements of article 24 of the nunavut land claims agreement in addition to the government s purchasing regulations
a review will be undertaken with nti to ensure that the policies meet the needs of nunavut and article 24
one of the largest divisions in the department is petroleum products
petroleum products is responsible for providing fuels to the communities of nunavut
the fuel is distributed by local contractors employing local people
this division has annual revenues of over 1 4 million dollars
fuel is supplied by ships or barges during the resupply period in the summer time
there is currently a contract in place with ntcl to supply this fuel until the end of year 2001
this will provide time to allow a review of the options available to lower costs
this will be done in conjunction with a review of the eastern arctic sealift which is co-ordinated by the coast guard until the year 2000
there are no problems being anticipated at this time
i hope these comments have been informative and i hope that i have been clear
so i am ready to go down to the witness chair

my question is is there any relationship or co-ordination between your department and minister and the department of education in reference to the information highway
chairperson interpretation
which of you will provide a response to that
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
not being fully briefed on all the details of this department we ve been very busy with our priorities i m sorry to say that but our priority is to serve the communities the best we can
i ll let mr mrazek add on to what i ve said
i m pretty sure that we will also service the small communities with the department of education if we have to but i ll let mr mrazek elaborate more on that
thank you
mr mrazek
with that i think we will put a little bit of light into it so member from arviat will get hopefully little bit clear picture
eventually all communities will be connected through the server and the main network
we have just completed meetings last week with northwesttel and we tried to resolve a number of the telecommunication issues between government between the northwesttel between the ardicom and few other suppliers
this thing is really a complex project
i m sorry i m not able to give you a specific date but we have the three major communities operational
we will be hooking up the arviat within the next several weeks and so is kugluktuk which will be operational and other community will follow
this progress it s extremely complex
it takes a very lots of energy manpower and it s basically going every two weeks and there are very serious meetings and progress check outs
i m sorry i cannot give you anymore specific dates but it s definitely nothing more original than to have all the communities connected in all through the intercom
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mrazek
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
thank you for that response mr mrazek
so the people back in my home community will be pleased to hear that we hope not for the next few weeks
my next question is in reference to some clarification on the bip the business incentive policy
in article 24 do we have anything in place at this point to say that the b i p will be in place prior to the summer projects being started or concluded
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
i hope you will be able to understand that because they will be translated to english for sure
perhaps mr mrazek will speak to this point a little further so he can clarify the situation
sometimes when it goes through the translator it kind of loses the meaning
chairperson interpretation
do you wish to add on to this mr mrazek
mr mrazek
i would like to add just a few notes for the benefit of everybody
the business incentive policy has been approved last week and it s interim measure for one year and what s happened basically is that the business and companies will get preference only within the nunavut territory
this way they benefit the companies and definitely benefit from that location
and nti as the interim measure mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr mrazek for that information
i wonder if the minister and her staff can speak briefly to their current thinking on sealift options
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
mr o brien
i couldn t hear that my headset could she repeat that
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr chairman thank you mr o brien
can you please rephrase your question and ask make it as understandable as to what you wish to make it understandable what you wish spoken to what you are alluding to can you clarify that please
mr o brien
in reference to sealift
have they reviewed sealift as it is
do they anticipate any changes as far as usage schedules and so on is there any we re thinking of existing sealift operations
chairperson interpretation
thank you
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you very much mr chairperson
we re up to review anything now because we re the new government i guess
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
please proceed
mr mrazek
in case of sealift you probably know that there is still contract with ntcl which government will be using
i believe that contract will expire next year
every region is slightly different rate and to be totally honest with you we didn t spend time and effort due to many other priorities for the last two months and that s basically what is happening right now
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
i m sorry
mr puqiqnak was actually ahead
please proceed
go ahead mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to understand who the suppliers for the petroleum are
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i might be mistaken i seem to know a little bit of it so i would refer that to mr mrazek
chairperson interpretation
go ahead mr mrazek
mr mrazek
petroleum products division tenders the fuel supply every year on the world market
one year you may get gasoline from amsterdam and another year from venezuela saudi arabia and everywhere else
it depends on who will give the government the best possible price for fuel or oil
in the case of the keewatin it is usually through the port of churchill
i hope that answers some of your questions
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
mr chairperson i would like to buy petroleum from saudi arabia because when i smell the petroleum here it s smells better than the gas we have
it has a sweeter smell than the fuel we have
therefore i keep bringing that up
i tend to believe that
i wish to raise a question to you and your staff
your review or research into the petroleum products when will that be completed
perhaps if you found out the reason for the gasoline problems i would like to hear that as soon as possible
again there have been a lot of machines breaking up and if you could find out perhaps the reason for the breakdown of these snowmobiles i would like to find that out
as well i know that this year i was there and the search & rescue division had to go and get people and had to use a lot of gasoline in order to rescue the hunters
even the search & rescue vehicles were breaking down and that was causing a safety concern
what are you going to do about this what are your plans for this problem that we are having in gjoa haven
starting in 1999 in january from then we have been sending letters to the gnwt and it s already been four months
i am sorry i have started to ramble on here but i would like to find out about this
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i understand that he is trying to represent his community and he is doing a good job
again we are the conduits for anything whether it be pleasurable or not because we are representing our community concerns because that is our mandate
he is representing his community i understand his comments properly and he raised a question in respect to the petroleum in gjoa haven
although i understand now and when he posed his question i have kept trying to get a response on this
my staff know exactly what has been happening in gjoa haven as well as the research into the petroleum
this is the one thing that i have understood today the government research into the gasoline they said that it was in acceptable levels
i understand that the hamlet also had an independent researcher look into the make up of the petroleum
i am not sure if this is true but i believe that they said it was acceptable
this is the extent of my understanding on the matter
in respect of the snowmobiles that were breaking down i have heard about it through the radio i heard the mayor alluding to this point
there are a lot of factors involved in skidoo breakdowns this i know however to date the research results have consistently come out saying that it is acceptable
that s all i have at this time but i will be visiting gjoa haven and the residents to meet with them on this petroleum issue
i am sorry that this has been like this for a while and i know that they re very displeased with it
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr puqiqnak perhaps if you have questions other than the petroleum because i know you will be dealing with that and the minister has stated that she will go to the community
do you have any other questions in respect of some other matter for public works
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
if you had a better response then i would prefer to be at the meeting but if you are just bringing the same response then i would prefer not to be at the meeting
if your response is going to continue to be the same then i am not going to be there but if you were to show some new initiative then i would want to be involved
mr chairman i also wanted to emphasize to the minister and her department the gasoline that caused the breakdowns this winter is going to be used again for the summer season
i guess some of the hunters are giving up on their summer travel plans because again they know they might lose their outboard motors if this winter is any indication of the breakdowns of snowmobiles
i am sorry that i keep referring to gasoline and petroleum because again this has caused a lot of stress in our community
especially this winter
again you did not quite respond in respect to i know that you stated that you are not responsible for snowmobiles broken down this winter but what are you going to do about it
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i understand that the member doesn t want to meet tomorrow and i accept that i have other things to do i guess it s okay
i appreciate his comments i don t know if i have any new items in regards to this i am just a new minister
i am sorry to say that i am reviewing what has been going on with the departments
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you ms thompson mr puqiqnak are you done
don t give up just because you get refused once you have to be persistent and that s why you were elected
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i think i should be sitting where you are madame minister i think that i would be perfect for the job
perhaps we should take a break and copies of your opening comments could be made and we would feel much better to deal with the budget estimates madame minister
i do think that i would be good in your position as minister because i know all about the man things like you said before
chairperson interpretation
would you stand up madame minister and mr iqaqrialu will take your place just kidding
let s take a short break to regroup after ms thompson makes a comment
hon manitok thompson interpretation
yes i can do this group and don t patronize me because i am a female because i know that i can work for pwtts thank you
chairperson interpretation
we will regroup and get copies of the opening comments and come back shortly
>>committee recessed at 4 38 pm and resumed at 4 57 pm
chairperson interpretation
thank you please take your seats
we are not supposed to have coffee in the legislature so please ensure that you don t bring your coffee in here
i was told that even in the committee of the whole that was the protocol
the translations are still being carried out and when they are completed they will be handed out
you will be receiving an english copy at this time
again the clock is running and i would like to return to our meeting
mr iqaqrialu i believe mr iqaqrialu has another question we will not be voting on the matter right now
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairperson
in regards to the bip that we just heard about article 24 that we just heard about
this afternoon earlier in question period contracts in regard to rfp s
i am sure that these are awarded to the best proposal and if they have bip and if they have article 24
the problem that i see with rfp s and i have asked the question earlier today to my colleagues is that it is not necessarily the lowest bidder that gets it
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
ms thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i would like to thank the member for his concern
we had talked about that and we have the department working with other departments to see how we can deal with article 24 in the nunavut government in a public government
i will have mr mrazek update us on his discussions in regards to article 24 and bip for contracting in nunavut
mr mrazek will elaborate a little bit more on that
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
i will try to describe the correct answer to mr mclean specifically
there is a major difference between a tender and a request for proposals
tenders are completely public request for proposal is not
that doesn t mean that people are prevented from providing a request for proposal
the only thing which contracting procedures according to the financial administration manual are prohibiting is to disclose prices to the general public with a request for a proposal
the reason for this is that you may receive more than one or several proposals which are completely different and you are not able to award an request for proposal to a proponent strictly based on the price
you will be basically comparing apples to oranges technically if you are disclosing that
requests for proposals are evaluated on selected criteria price is one of them but obviously there are many others
the evaluation process is completely fair can be verified it is usually a committee and obviously the cost/benefit analysis including bip and article 24 plays a major role
i am not sure if i answered your question but any request for proposals even including the tenders they don t have to be awarded if the government finds that they are not able to pay for it
chairperson interpretation
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairperson
in the presentation out of 108 positions in regional operations a total of 40 new are staffed by inuit
this represents 37% of the work force in the department
the services provided are purchasing contracting building maintenance and delivery of petroleum products
is the department taking a concerted effort to make sure that the inuit employment factor gets up to at least 50% and is the department conscious of that in bringing more people into this department
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
sorry ms thompson or mr mrazek
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
we will make a commitment to do inuit employment plans for the department if it has not been done already
i will be committed to bringing more inuit staff into this department as i have been asked by the member
we will make sure that this is done by this department
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
mr mclean
mr mclean
the decentralization plan for the department is proceeding
this is scheduled to begin in the year 2000 as additional housing and office space becomes available
speaking for my own community there is an abundance of staff housing and office space
if the minister needs correspondence i can make it available to their department but i am sure that they have it
there are two technical service positions slated for baker lake
getting to that i am also asking is decentralized going to happen a bit quicker than next year in this department
chairperson interpretation
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
from the public works side there are two positions slated with information technology as the support staff for baker lake
that is my understanding according to the organizational charts
to be honest with you i am not sure if these things will happen between now and the next summer
those positions are strictly depending on the decentralization of the other departments to the community because those two positions will be supporting the network for other departments
besides that there will be or there will have to be a training period when we have the outsourcing period with a contractor to train a number of people for those positions
i have just been involved in the rankin situation when we had three potential inuit employees who have microsoft experience and who will be put on line probably within the next couple of weeks
as far as baker i think we will probably have to wait a little while until decentralization is in progress
otherwise those positions will not be able to support anything at this point in time
chairperson interpretation
mr mclean
mr mclean
on that answer i don t find it acceptable
there is a training component in it i have been in the office in rankin inlet at public works and services there and there s an abundance of staff there
so i think by identifying and training a few unemployed inuit people from baker lake that this would probably fast track your positions in baker lake
thank you
thank you
at this time the clock is running could you please make your questions and comments concise and understandable
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i would like to ask this question in respect to petroleum products
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson or mr mrazek
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
sustainable development would probably have something for subsidizing skidoo fuel
but we would be reviewing the cost of fuel in the near future so the members are invited to put in their comments at that time
thank you
chairperson interpretation
is that all
mr tootoo could you make your question concise and understandable please
mr tootoo
honourable members mr chairman i am trying to think how to say it really quick
mr chairman i am wondering if the minister or her staff can let us know if their department is responsible or confirm if their department is responsible for providing all the capital delivery of nunavut
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
yes we are
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
in light of that i know that in some communities and again going back to housing not only in baffin but in other regions there are communities that have been empowered to provide the capital delivery responsible to housing
i am just wondering mr chairman if the department will be looking at honouring those inaudible comment or maybe taking back those responsibilities from the municipalities that are already doing it
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
every case will be slightly different when the local housing association is able willing to provide for capital projects i m referring to housing as you mentioned before but definitely we ll give them every opportunity to do that
most housing associations are developed to the point that they are able to provide this type of building activity
some of them are more developed than others but it s individual cases because it s supporting local community we always look into that first before the decision is made
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mrazek
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
i would hope that it would happen within the baffin i know over the last 2 years all the lho s had delivered all the capital
i m wondering will that be still the case and continuing along with that type of service and more of an advisory and support role
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
thank you mr chairman
yes that basically will continue mr tootoo and i said before and we are giving local housing organization every opportunity for further improvement so they are able to deliver the capital projects
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mrazek
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i have few more short questions is your department responsible for setting the rents the staff will be paying for all the staff housing units
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
it s not exactly public works responsibility it s joint responsibility mainly it is the department human resources and some advise from public works as far as the technical qualifications are concerned
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mrazek
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
does your department would they have an idea as i understand your department covers off all the lease costs related to staff housing
we have to know what rents are going to be charged in order to know the effect and therefore determine the levels of subsidies that are provided to staff for staff housing
i m wondering if the ministers staff can provide us with information on what those subsidies are for the various staff housing units
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
thank you mr chairman
but that s a very general rule
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mrazek
i told you that you would have a last question these people still have not made a comment
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to ask a question in regards to petroleum products
in pelly bay usually when the planes come in to my community there s no fuel for the airplanes and that barge cannot really transport fuel and we are requesting that we get aviation fuel in our community
i was wondering if you department can find ways if to get aviation fuel in pelly bay
that s my first question to find out if we can get aviation fuel how can we get aviation fuel in our community
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation

mr alakannuark i think mr puqiqnak would like to make a comment now because he has been writing notes to me
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
first of all i would like to apologize to my colleague and to her department although i stated earlier that i was a little upset
as i had stated that i don t want to take part in your meeting but i would like to apologize to you as a member of the legislative assembly
i have to represent my community and i hope that we will be working closely together in the future
if the minister can respond to me and perhaps clarify to us after i think that it would ve been better had i known about it
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you
tomorrow morning i ll meet with you at 11 00
i will go ahead and meet with you i didn t think you wanted to take part but we ll continue meeting with you
i received a letter from mr puqiqnak quite a lengthy letter
i cannot tell you that i will be compensating for the snowmobiles but as i have stated to you earlier we will look into it and we will deal with that
i will to continue to work with it but i apologize that the results from the study we still have not gotten the results yet we haven t had a chance to review the results yet
so based on that i can t do anything about the skidoos because i am not sure that it was the fuel that caused them
anyway in the future i am not prepared to help out with the skidoos thank you very much
chairperson mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
now that we will meet with you tomorrow i will expect better answers then
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
thank you for giving me a copy of your opening comment for it gave me better information here
your main estimates for the department are divided 67 1 million dollars for o&m and 5 7 for capital
in regards to article 24 there is quite a bit of dollars to be contracted out accordance to article 24
article 24 states that only if the company is 51% inuit owned they would be the first priority to get the contract
are you using article 24
thank you
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
in regards to your question article 24 we will have to do things in accordance with article 24
our department is now looking at bip and article 24
it seems like article 24 was not acknowledged by our previous government because there were more than one aboriginal in that area
for that reason we will work in accordance to article 24 and how we can implement article 24 and we will be working on this issue in the future and we will involve the regular members
i would like to get your input but at this time we are at our initial stage
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you for giving me a very clear response
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman in the ministers remarks she has indicated that we will spend a budget of 67 1 million dollars for o&m
i just note that a large part of this o&m is under asset management and is approximately 42 million dollars but there is no detail
i wonder if the minister and her staff could provide some detail as to what this 42 million dollars is for
it is not contained in the budget book
thank you
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson
i am sorry we don t have the detail in front of us right now but the finance person here might be able to give us an idea what the question is
we can certainly provide it in detail on paper at a later date if you want
i will ask my finance person here to provide as much detail as he can from what he has
thank you mr chairperson
mr galbraith inaudible comments million dollars and the other o&m consists of 50 million dollars
that line includes the lease payments o&m for the maintenance of the buildings a multitude of activities that we perform
i don t know how much detail you wanted but i could definitely provide that to you at a later date
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
i m not trying to be difficult for asking if information is not reasonable but i think it will be very very difficult to pass this budget of this department without having that information available to us
we re talking about $47 million
i think it s important that we have an opportunity to see this otherwise it wouldn t be prudent for us to pass such a large amount of money without knowing the details
thank you
chairperson
interpretation the finance controller would like to respond
go ahead mr ng
hon kelvin ng
i just wanted to him to give me some clarification because it just seems like you re into the budget detail now
i wasn t sure if we ve moved into that because it was in the general questions and if that s the case it s fine but they d be prepared to answer when we get to the detail page
because we haven t gotten into the page by page yet that mr chairman is the point i was trying to make
thank you
chairperson interpretation
since your information is on the main estimates go ahead
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
i m referring to the opening remarks made by the minister it does indicate $67 1 million
so really what i m questioning is it s a question relating to opening remarks
i don t see the details in the budget period
but if that information is available going page by page well that s fine if we can have it before we conclude this department
i m more than pleased to agree with that
thank you
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson
it seems like the finance person here has dug out the information
he can just read the list down if the member wishes to hear that
interpretation the finance person can go down the list with details
can he go ahead with those
they re not very long
if it s okay with you mr chairman
mr o brien
if the department has those details that s fine
we can wait until the page by page and hear what the details are then
thank you
chairperson interpretation
so are you done
no more question
mr tootoo
let me first ask if ms thompson are you going to ask for comments from the person beside you
what we usually do is that you have to ask general comments and then we go into the detail page by page
and i think that some of the questions that are being asked will be fitting into the page by page and then we can add in the amounts that we were talking about
thank you
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
just want to go back to the earlier comment made by mr mrazek in regards to inquiring whether we wouldn t mind seeing information written
i would love to see that
then i would just ask for some kind of timeline when to expect that information
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr mrazek
mr mrazek
if you re referring to the rent scale as far as the individual housing are concerned we can provide that within one weeks time
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
will that include the lease cost the rent charged to the unit that the tenant would have to pay and the subsidy that the nunavut government is paying
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
go ahead
mr mrazek
i can provide that to you within one weeks time
in the case of the other region it s probably a little bit longer but you know no problem there
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
since there are no more people willing or wanting to ask questions or comments
so back to the main estimates
do you have a copy
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the two people beside my witnesses don t have a copy of the main estimates
you can just go ahead our financial officer doesn t have one
so if there was a spare copy he s got it already
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
are you going to be reading

mr chairman that is correct mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
can i have the amount that is dedicated to just our lease costs
the amount that is for leases chairperson interpretation
go ahead
mr galbraith
yes mr chairman the amount dedicated for lease payments for this year is approximately 20 million dollars chairperson interpretation
mr o brien does that answer your question mr o brien
yes mr chairman i would ask if we could get a detailed written copy that the finance comptroller just provided to us in more detail and just to get this clear in my mind
he has indicated that our lease costs out of this 47 million dollars is approximately 20 million dollars
is that correct chairperson interpretation
go ahead mr galbraith
that s the amount that has been budgeted that s an approximation i can get the exact and the specifications at a later date but it s approximately 20 million dollars of that amount that has been budgeted for lease payments chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien

in reference to contract services and other amounts

mr chairperson it is something as well in that 34 million dollars contract payments part of that is leases

petroleum products revolving fund
information item
public service revolving fund
information item
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson in reference to the petroleum products revolving fund
we have an authorized limit of 60 million dollars the expenditures are at 39 807
i wonder if the minister or one of her staff could speak briefly to the workings of this fund and the purpose so members can have a better understanding as to what it is for
thank you chairperson
galbraith mr galbraith
thank you mr chairperson
the revolving fund is set up separately from public works as all revolving funds are
i guess the best way to put it is that it is basically a separate balance sheet altogether and it doesn t play into the regular expenditures of the government
the authorized limit here of 60 million was taken from all of the gnwt for last year and it could be cut down considerably
it was put together as you ll notice the other revolving funds as well and it was taken from the main estimates from last year because we couldn t put the number together quick enough
but that is the authorized limit
their supplying the service of providing fuel to the communities so their expenditures are to try to equal the sales
thank you mr chairperson chairperson
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman in view of the time we will soon have to make a decision as to whether to extend our hours to conclude this department
or we would have to make a motion to report progress
i certainly don t want to make that on behalf of the members so we should get consensus as to what the wish is before we run out of time chairperson
mr o brien mr o brien
mr chairman i would like to move that we extend the hours to conclude this item some members
agreed chairperson interpretation
there is a motion on the floor to extend the time to conclude this department
to the motion
those in favour of the motion please signify
those opposed
the motion is carried
our meeting will go beyond 6 o clock to finish this department public service revolving fund
information item
mr tootoo mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
just on that you said the authorized limit is 60 million dollars and we should be able to come in way short of that and that was the amount for last year that was in the total gnwt budget
is that an amount that is taken out and put aside an amount of dollars or is that just a limit that you can go up to it is not tying up any dollars from anywhere else
is that the case
thank you mr chairperson chairperson
mr galbraith mr galbraith
thank you mr chairperson
yes that is correct mr chairman chairperson interpretation
public service revolving fund
information item
agreed
you don t have to agree to that
okay 6 12 granular program revolving fund information item 6 13 detail of work performed on behalf of third parties
information item
mr tootoo mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i had a question on the granular program revolving fund
unfortunately i didn t get recognized in time before you switched over
i would ask to go back and ask a short little question in regards to the granular program revolving fund
thank you mr chairperson chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo is requesting to go back to the granular program revolving fund
are there any nays
since i don t hear any nays you may go ahead mr tootoo
try to put your hand up high when you want to speak so we can see you
mr tootoo mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i m only so tall but i will try better
mr chairman just again just a question for clarification
is this amount again another amount that was derived from last year s gnwt budget
if so if it was not that is my first point on that question if you could answer that
thank you mr chairperson chairperson
mr galbraith mr galbraith
thank you mr chairperson
i want you to understand that the department of public works really didn t have a finance division set up at headquarters and the regional office we weren t much involved in this
well we were involved in the sense that we were consulted by the department of finance in putting this budget together
to answer your question yes this is a gnwt number coming from last year s main estimates
the number more theoretically here in nunavut is more to the 4 - 6 million range chairperson
mr tootoo mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i just want to confirm that it was not just a nunavut thing as i would imagine that if it was taken off last years there s going to be a lot more need for granular materials throughout nunavut chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
ms thompson hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson the second comment i think the last comment he made was just a comment not a question chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
is that all
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
i ask for your indulgence
i was concentrating on the petroleum products revolving fund when i asked the question as to whether we should report progress or continue
once we made that agreement i didn t get a chance to finish my question
i wonder if i could go back for one question regarding the petroleum products revolving fund and the 60 million dollars that s identified in the budget chairperson interpretation
i believe this has to be approved
are you asking us to agree
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
as i ve indicated the authorized limit is 60 million dollars in the revolving fund
this i believe is also a gnwt figure
so is this representing at the time the total fund for the gnwt and for nunavut
if it is then this fund should be much greatly reduced and probably cut in half if that is my understanding
what is a realistic number because this is what the budget is now so what actually is a closer number that would represent nunavut chairperson interpretation
mr galbraith mr galbraith
thank you mr chairperson
i am not all exactly sure what the authorized limit actually means
it is not necessarily a budget figure i believe that they would have to should they exceed this in sales or expenditures they would have to go and get some sort of permission
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
one final question and a point of clarification
if this figure is not accurate and we re being asked to pass this budget and the figure is not accurate what figure would more closely reflect the nunavut situation chairperson
ms thompson hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman we are just borrowing mr galbraith from the regional office he is not a headquarters person we are just borrowing him from the region
he is doing us a favour by being here so just be patient and bear with us
when i became the minister of the department we just had three staff that was the dm the adm and another adm or a secretary
my apologies thank you chairperson interpretation
mr galbraith if you could perhaps clarify the figure mr galbraith
thank you mr chairperson
i just want to emphasize that the authorized limit is the upset limit so to speak
it is an arbitrary number they tried to get it as accurate as possible but this number included the west
the numbers below there the income and expenditures the salary and wages was put together by our team in rankin inlet and was put into the budget and these numbers are right on
thank you mr chairperson chairperson interpretation
did you get the clarification you wanted mr o brien
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman maybe i am not as informed on this issue as i should be
i don t want to cause any confusion or embarrassment to the minister or her staff and i realize that they are a very new department and so on
but i think what i am trying to do is just get this straight in my mind and in the other members that are here in their mind
this is i think a very significant barrier we are talking about a large number of dollars here
i will ask a question maybe mr mrazek because i know he has been around for quite a while he may be able to shed some more light on this
if for example the authorized limit is 60 million dollars if that weren t utilized could that money be used for something else
thank you chairperson interpretation
mr mrazek mr mrazek
what i would like to answer is that finance is not my background and i cannot really make that comment or commitment as to what could be done with the balance of the money
as mr galbraith said basically the money is not really in the budget from that standpoint
it is a maximum limit to which petroleum products can buy fuel or any other thing
they cannot go anything over that but they always stay below chairperson interpretation
madame minister perhaps you could shed more light on the matter hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson
what you are approving is the two numbers and those are the numbers that make sense
these are main estimates what we would think that we would be spending but as mr mrazek has just indicated this is not the actual number it goes below that
what you are approving is 39 million 807 thousand if you are wanting to approve it
thank you mr chairperson chairperson interpretation
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
please bear with me
i am just trying to sort out more details about the revolving fund itself
can the revolving fund be used for example to construct a capital project
can the revolving fund be used for anything other than petroleum products
it strictly deals with the purchase of petroleum products
is that correct chairperson interpretation
ms thompson hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson i know mr ng would really like to answer that but i will answer it for him anyway
this is strictly for petroleum products thank you chairperson
mr tootoo mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i am going to beg the indulgence of the members and they might know better but maybe i am just asking would a better way to explain this revolving fund authorized limit would be like a line of credit
so there is no actual cash involved from any other sources within government dollars
is that a simpler way to explain it
thank you mr chairperson chairperson
mr galbraith
ms thompson hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairperson i might refer this to the finance minister
he wasn t listening was he
did you get the question
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson
it is my understanding that this is like a line of credit it authorizes the petroleum products fund to purchase inventory and then use the inventories to recover the costs of supplying that inventory
this isn t an approval item this is actually an information item that we are debating here
so i don t know if that clarifies it it is supposed to be revenue neutral whatever you bring in it goes back out in expenditures and inventory
thank you chairperson interpretation
i believe that question was answered
mr anawak i believe you wanted to make a comment or question hon jack anawak interpretation
not to the matter i just wanted to tell ms thompson in respect to the granular program revolving fund i know that they stockpile in some communities
i have noted twice in broughton clyde river and rankin inlet that the granular materials usually have a written thing this is owned by dpw do not trespass
i am just wondering about that chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
you stated that you were talking about some other matter i just saw a do not trespass sign on the granular stockpiles i believe that is more of a comment than a question

importance of literacy birthday
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
recognizing that our children are the future leaders of nunavut it is imperative to give them the tools leading to their success

i believe that literacy is very important and should not be overlooked it is crucial that the government of the nunavut acknowledge the seriousness of this issue by continuing to support literacy
i would also like to take this opportunity to wish my son kyle siksinaaq mclean a happy 8th birthday and i d like to be there today

equitable staff housing allocation
mr tootoo
thank you speaker
mr speaker i rise today to speak on the matter of staff housing not only here in iqaluit but in the rest of our communities
i think we all agree that the employees of the government of nunavut deserve to be in adequate accommodations
i am concerned that there seems to be multiple levels operating especially here in iqaluit
i hope now after april 1st there is only one standard and that all employees whether their headquarters or regional staff are being allocated housing based on their need for suitable affordable adequate housing

congratulations to coral harbour teacher education program graduates
hon james arvaluk
interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i m pleased and proud as the member from nanulik to extend my congratulations to the first graduates of the community teacher education program in coral harbour who are graduating today
these graduates have taken the first step to success and whether they go on to further study or go directly to the workplace they are the future of this new territory
these graduates also will be the teachers of the future generations to come
we did not achieve nunavut alone nor have they achieved graduation alone therefore i would also like to thank their families friends and teachers for the support they have given them throughout their studies and trying times
education is not accomplished alone and the support of others is essential our culture is one of collaboration and connectedness
we must continue to celebrate the sense of community and sharing
education does not necessarily mean textbooks alone it also includes the community and sharing culturally and i would like to congratulate these students on their success
that s a real position that you have worked hard to obtain and you deserve the honour accompanied by the success
that is for the students in coral harbour

item 6
oral questions
question 66 - 1 2
allocation of staff housing
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the minister responsible for staff housing i believe the minister for human resources
mr speaker i m wondering if the minister could inform us as to whether this staff housing is for all government employees or is there a distinction between headquarters and regional staff
thank you mr speaker
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker right now as i indicated there are two different approval mechanisms and i also believe i have indicated that s why we re trying to co-ordinate a new staff housing policy and take into consideration all those factors
we also have the issue of staff housing in our regional centres as well that we ve inherited so there is a multitude of issues that has to address
thank you mr speaker
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
thank you mr speaker
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i believe i indicated that we inherited both mechanisms and both policies for allocations
one and he recognized it in his statement as well one from gnwt on the regional allocation for regional positions and one at the headquarters level that was inherited from the office of interim commissioner
so right now one of the issues quite frankly is how do you deal with that
do you pull them together and if that were the case for example you have dedicated headquarters positions that are targeted for headquarter staffing
so those are the kinds of issues as i have indicated that have to be addressed
one other issue quite frankly the people probably haven t realized and i think that we have to address that as well is what about our employees right now that are in public housing
it has to be looked at and explored in some form of these
thank you mr speaker
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo

do they have to be stuck in those accommodations while we have existing units that are sitting empty and i believe we re paying for them

hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
you will be handed out the notes for my opening comments
mr chairman and honourable members of the legislative assembly i am pleased to present to you the 1999/2000 main estimates for the department of justice
i think i will be introducing the officials later remind me if i forget
the justice system is important to each one of us
it affects the everyday lives of people across nunavut the 1999-2000 main estimates reflect the department s effort to promote a shift in the way that justice services have been delivered in the past
the business plan which we wish to undertake outlines critical issues facing the department of justice we face serious challenges
the answers will not be easy
the business plan and the budget for the department of justice does not include funding for new initiatives other than the establishment of the nunavut court of justice
this nunavut court of justice was already put in motion by the interim commissioner on the advice of the nunavut implementation commission and after a consultation conference sponsored by the office of the interim commissioner in november 1997
in this initial year we will be assessing the expenditures of the department and determining first if there are any funds that can be re-allocated within existing allocations
we believe that long term solutions will only be reached through working with communities or better yet giving communities the authority to deal with problems themselves
we recognize that in order for this to happen we will need to provide more support including funding to communities in the future
the responsibility to support communities in providing healing training and crime prevention will also require us to work closely with other departments of the nunavut government
culture language elders and youth as an example health and social services education and my other portfolio community government housing and transportation
1999/2000 will be an important year for the department as we work with programs that we have inherited from the nwt and we will have to assess how they are functioning and what changes may be needed
several of our programs are contracted back to the gnwt for this transitional year
we will be working hard to get the staff and infrastructure in place to establish the full range of programs here in nunavut by the end of the year
we will be doing some important planning this year too
for example a corrections planning committee has been established to review corrections program and facility requirements and make recommendations
this committee has representation from communities as well as from the corrections system and we expect them to consider new approaches to the way in which inmates are handled
in cooperation with the department of justice for canada the assistant deputy minister rebecca williams has held meetings with community justice chairs from all the regions within nunavut
the information and advice received from them will help guide the department in determining how to support further development of community justice capacity as an alternative to the formal justice system within nunavut
i also have to say that the delivery of probation services will continue to be done by social workers
the social workers are paid through the department of health and social services
this will continue with regard to the law review process being requested by cabinet additional funds will have to be found
my department s budget would not cover this expenditure
you will see in your materials that the budget for the department of justice is broken down into two main categories
first operations and maintenance and then the capital plan
in your review of the main estimates you will see on page 5-3 that our operations and maintenance budget totals $36 998 000 00
through the framework exercise our original budget requirement was reduced to the amount currently allocated
the operations and maintenance part of the budget is broken down by these branches within the department
directorate law enforcement legal services board lawyer support services registries and court services as well as community justice and corrections directorate
directorate
this branch is responsible for the management and administration of the department
law enforcement
this refers to the contract with the r c m p
legal services board
the boards are responsible for the delivery of legal aid services throughout nunavut
lawyer support services
departmental lawyers are responsible for example we have departmental lawyers in our department
they will be providing the nunavut government with legal advice
registries and court services
this category covers a wide range of items including the various legal registries the nunavut court of justice and other functions such as the coroner and the fair practices/rental officer
community justice and corrections
this branch is responsible for the operation of the baffin correctional centre here in iqaluit and out post camps as well as the funding for community justice committees
as you can see the department of justice has a very small capital budget totalling $313 000
approximately $300 000 is for security upgrades at the correctional centre here in iqaluit
additional capital funding will be required in the future if we are going to repatriate our offenders from nwt institutions
the department is waiting for recommendations from the corrections planning committee before identifying these future capital needs
mr chairman this concludes the formal part of my presentation today
we will be pleased to answer any questions you have about the budget for the department of justice
i am also interested in comments you may have or ideas about how we can work together to build a stronger justice system
i would like to invite my officials mr chairman
nora sanders my deputy minister and mike rudolph my financial advisor
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
you may step to the witness chair including your officials

mr puqiqnak7
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i will be reading so please do not i will try not to put you to sleep so please bear with me
in respect to the department of justice mr chairman i will be reading the report
mr anawak appeared before the committee on the morning of april 30th
the main estimate summary provided to the committee indicated the total 1999/2000 in expenditures of $37 310 706 of which $313 000 00 is allotted to capital spending
the committee was quite impressed with the level of detail provided during the ministers appearance
the nunavut law review
the minister stated that the cabinet had approved in principle a nunavut law review which would operate independently but they would have to report to the minister of justice
this would be in consultation with the minister of culture language elders and youth
the committee encouraged the minister to involve the elders in the work of the review to the fullest extent as possible
mr chairman we also want to speak to the single time zone for nunavut
i believe they say that they use a different clock they use a different one but we are speaking about the single time zone for nunavut
the minister indicated that his department had undertaken a legal review of this initiative that was announced by the commissioner in her opening address to the assembly on april 1/ 1999
the minister also indicated that this might be accomplished in the spring or summer of this year
the committee urged the minister to implement this change at the earliest opportunity
mr chairman in respect to the gun registration
the committee expressed a very strong concern in respect to unilingual inuit constituents have great difficulty associated with completing paperwork
this has caused difficulties for the people associated with the federal government registration policies
the minister indicated that in respect of the upcoming discussions with his federal counterpart that the issue would be raised with a view to exploring solutions
the committee would like an update on this issue as soon as new information becomes available to the department in respect to gun registration issues
community justice
the committee was very happy and applauded the ministers commitment to emphasizing the importance of progress in this field
the committee noted the ministers caution that budgetary restraints have put pressure on the funds allocated for this area
one member suggested that the communities should be responsible for dealing with summary offences
for example using summary offences that are not dangerous acts the community justice committee should be able to deal with them
mr chairman the minister also indicated his desire to see a more uniform functioning of the community justice committees across nunavut
just as an example to ensure that offenders do not become repeat offenders
the committee was supportive of the ministers goal to work with minister picco in pursuing the establishment of a probation system for the department
corrections planning committee
the minister provided an update on the activities of the newly formed corrections planning committee which would be meeting again in may
one issue that the members of the committee raised was the possibility of a federal correctional facility being established in nunavut
the minister indicated that the corrections planning committee would study the issue but that it was too soon to say yes to a joint facility
members expressed their interest in seeing a correctional facility established in the kitikmeot and keewatin
on the land outpost camps
the committee expressed its desire to see the program accelerated
the minister indicated that the program hadn t taken off as quickly as the department would have liked but they would make efforts to do so if feasible
the ministers deputy further noted that the corrections representatives had recently travelled to baker lake and arviat and would travel to kitikmeot in june
security considerations were cited as being an obstacle to overnight success with respect to this issue
that concludes the committee report mr chairman i would like to move a motion

mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson the standing committees reports on the main estimates
in the committees report the figure is different
i would like to ask the minister that in his opening remarks his figures are totally different from the committee report and from the main estimates
i would like to get a response as the figures in all three documents are different
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
the department s main estimates are 37 million 311 thousand for capital expenditures 313 thousand
part of the 313 thousand is for security upgrades at the correctional centre here in iqaluit
i could get detailed information for the 313 thousand but the main estimates figure is 37 million 311 thousand it did not change
i just want to explain to you that the capital will be 313 thousand but the operations & maintenance is 36 thousand 998 mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu are you more clear now
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
yes i see them now thank you
chairperson interpretation
are there any other general comments
i don t have any people on my list please raise your hands if you have any questions
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
just in regards to the gun control registration
i wanted to ask the minister if that was a responsibility of his department or was the responsibility for that program under his federal counterparts department
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
the federal government s justice minister is responsible for gun registration
i was going to meet with minister ann mclellan on may 3rd i went down to ottawa to meet with her but somebody got shot in alberta and she had to go to the funeral
therefore i couldn t get connected with her so we will have a meeting on june 7th
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i guess the administration of this program as the minister indicated falls under federal jurisdiction
is the minister aware of how many employees the federal justice department has to administer this program in nunavut
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
gnwt did not want to take on this responsibility so the federal government has this jurisdiction at this time
gnwt had been asked to take on this responsibility but they did not want to take it on we don t have any staff members so i would like to discuss this matter
i tried to meet with ann mclellan but she had to go to alberta for a funeral as a student was shot in one of the schools
at his time we don t have any staff members now but would like to get a staff member who is inuit and bilingual and could reflect inuit culture
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
the minister mentioned the gnwt i wonder if he meant the government of nunavut or the old gnwt as far as taking on these programs
hon jack anawak interpretation
they asked the gnwt if they would take on this responsibility
i have been trying to get together with the minister so we can look at means and ways of dealing with gun registration in nunavut
chairperson interpretation
please recognize the chair before you make your comments
thank you
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman just to point out to the minister i know hopefully he will be bringing up these concerns with his federal counterpart is that this whole process is very cumbersome for the inuit people in nunavut
hon jack anawak interpretation
that is what i have been trying to say for a long time
i have been trying to get in touch with the minister and i know the concerns very well as i am a hunter myself
i know exactly where the rest of the hunters of nunavut are coming from
i think we should be able to do that without spending any money from nunavut
what we have been trying to do is work together with the justice department at the federal level
we have tried to set up meetings
we did have two tentative meetings which were cancelled and there is another one set up for june 7 i believe
chairperson interpretation
is that an adequate response mr tootoo
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman the minister spoke about the use of traditional counselling land camps and so on and i think that everyone here is in support of that strongly
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you as i said earlier there is a committee struck to deal with the setting up of such a structure
rebecca williams can talk about it in detail because she works with that committee
they are considering and talking with the department of justice at the federal level about setting up some type of facility in the nunavut area
rebecca williams and i went to fenbrook which is a federal penitentiary
i can t say it was a nice tour but the facility is situated in a southern province
we are going to work very hard to see if we can house those inmates up here and we are going to keep looking for money
for the serious crimes we are going to keep sending the inmates down south
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
just for a point of clarification mr chairman
can you clarify that thank you
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
mr chairman
interpretation ends there is a possibility of getting some funding to get a correctional facility up here which would probably focus at the beginning on the more medium security type inmates
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
thank you mr anawak that answered my question
i thought it was a little too harsh using the word murderers but what i was referring to was the more serious crimes but not to that degree
more or less an expansion of what we have now for example in the baffin and over in yk
my second comment or question is in reference to law reform
you have indicated that you are going to involve elders in this review
what role do you see for the members that sit on the standing committee on justice
what role do you see these members playing in this review
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
mr chairman at this point in time we are having discussions with culture language elders & youth on the law review
we have not come to the point of deciding exactly what the make up will be but it will certainly be with the advice and the participation of some members or a member of that committee
i mean if we are going to move forward we want to move forward with regular members
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
for further clarification i would like to know how many judges there are in nunavut
how many judges are there that work on the circuit in the nunavut area
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
maybe ms sanders could respond to that question chairperson
ms sanders
ms sanders two judges have been appointed
the senior judge judge brown is already sitting here the second judge judge kilpatrick will be coming in june
he was sworn in on april 1st but has not yet started
hopefully by this time next year there will be a third judge appointed and those three judges will serve all of nunavut
so right now 2 and there will be 3
at times we also have deputy judges or judges from other jurisdictions that come for a week or two to help out or to do a circuit that sort of thing
that can be where there is a conflict or where the work load gets too heavy
chairperson interpretation
thank you ms sanders
we heard both the inuktitut and the english on one channel
could we have the technician fix that problem please
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
the reason why i asked that question is just because you don t have enough judges you defer some of the sittings
for example they set appointments for when they re going to be sitting and they keep deferring the date from one date to the next and possibly three-four times
they re adjourned three-four times is it because of a lack of judges that you keep adjourning the sittings
they set up an appointment it doesn t go through then they set another sitting and so on and it effects the people who have to wait a long time to go through the court system
is there a good reason
there could be a lot of reasons that the person can be effected like there s tiredness there s anxiousness and everything else so that s why i asked my question
chairperson interpretation
thank you puqiqnak
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
ms sanders will make a supplementary to my remarks
what we did was set up one court system when we became nunavut because it seems that it takes a longer time when you have different levels
possibly ms sanders could make a supplementary comment
chairperson
ms sanders
ms sanders
i think the minister s already said the important things
chairperson interpretation
any further questions
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we re going to be responsible for the operations and maintenance and because of that i will not be able to support the building of such facilities
the correctional if we re looking at the correctional centres in the nunavut area we re just going to be using money instead of helping our people
we have to think like that in the future
if we re going to be building correctional centres and jails and so on it s just going to be eating our money without helping the people
with that in mind the nunavut government should seriously look into preventative and educational programs
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
i we would be very glad to start such programs if we didn t need correctional centres or jails
i truly support the idea of setting up such programs but of course there s always going to be people in correctional facilities
there s some in fenbrook and some in bowden and some in yellowknife
we are putting our money into those facilities every day and we pay the ontario government we pay the alberta government and the government of the northwest territories for housing these inmates
of course we truly support preventative methods and educational programs if we can find money to pay for such programs
but looking at the number of people that are in the southern penitentiaries i don t believe that the numbers are going to decrease
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you
there s not much we can do in that area but i think we have to work together
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
regarding the comments that were just made by the member
i know that i think there s a concern in all of the communities people often feel that someone who hasn t offended seriously should not have been sent away
that s why we want to see local people dealing with these issues especially when they are jps dealing with people that they know and who come from the community
what is your problem
what can we do to help you
but that step is not part of the present administration of justice so we want to promote those kinds of things and we re working on getting those kinds of programs in place
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
are you finished
yes i understand what you are saying and i think that you all understand the same thing but you re just in different stages of trying to reach your goal
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i have a question that i would like to ask regarding the role of the elders and it s one of the goals of the department to involve elders in their programs
now in which way are you going to involve the elders
is that going to be at the local level or are you going to get the elders together to decide on the goals and objectives of the department
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes thank you
i think we also have to be aware that not only the elders have to be involved
we will have to involve the young people as well because i think we all know that they have different things to contribute
we have different understandings and different issues in various stages of life when we say adults we re thinking about elders those people who are older than us not just adults
i just want you to be aware of that
the elders are much more involved in justice issues especially in the area of justice committees in smaller communities
when we re talking about the department of justice i know you re asking about that
i think that the nunavut government is going to be using the elders in their programs
we re trying to institute the inuit traditional knowledge or inuit qaujimajituqangit
this is going to be one of the first priorities in how we can involve the elders and other people in the communities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes i understand what you are saying
we will need jails in the future as well as now
we have a traditional system of justice and our forefathers did not use jails
i know that you have to send some people to jail yes that s a given and it s not going to go away but we have to somehow to use the traditional form of dealing with the offenders
that has not worked
i think sometimes people are sent away to jail like to penitentiaries when it would not have been necessary
even people who are still in denial of having committed a crime are convicted in court and is sent away to heal
presently the people who have been sent away to correctional centres and jails have not seen a healing process
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes thank you mr chairman
i m sorry i forgot to mention that
that is another area that we re seriously looking at we need to have on the land programs where people can go to as an alternative to jails
if we re going to institute a traditional form of justice i think we can be looking at that
if we change everything right away it might not be a good thing for everybody
i know that people have been hurt by the system because it s not their system and they did not set it up but right now we don t have much alternative to the present court system
that s why we want to review this first and try and institute the inuit way of dealing with offenders
i think that we re going to see fewer people being put away even though i was talking about putting people into correctional centres or penitentiaries but in an inuit sense being punished is not really in our vocabulary
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman just a question for the minister
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman

chairperson
tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
anawak
hon jack anawak
there has to be an understanding that the gun control challenge has nothing to do with hunting rights
chairperson interpretation
tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i don t mean to get going on this but he still hasn t answered whether there would be grounds to pursue it or not
and no mention to whether it relates to hunting rights or anything like that i m just wondering if there are grounds to pursue a challenge or not i m wondering if there are grounds or not
that s quite simple
thank you mr chairman
hon jack anawak
one part of canada is not challenging the bill it s a judgement call more than anything else
chairperson interpretation
tootoo
i think it ll be your last question mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess then in that case and as the minister mentioned it it s up to what you consider grounds
is it not the justice department s mandate to provide advice to the government on such matters
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
again my advice is that we don t have to expend the 400 thousand dollars
chairperson interpretation
i would like to give a chance to those members who did not have a chance to ask their questions or comments
mr nutarak did you want to make a comment
no
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation

mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i want to get back to the gun bill
i understand what mr tootoo is saying and we know that there is a lot of concern out there regarding the bill
i know in my community there have been many comments and concerns raised
i guess the train is already heading down the track and somebody else is paying for the gas we should just look forward to it getting to it s destination
my concern right now is the problem we have in the meantime in people trying to get their guns registered
thank you
chairperson interpretation
who would like to respond
hon jack anawak
chairperson interpretation
do you have anything further mr o brien
mr o brien
no that s all i have to say at this point
mr chairman i wonder if it is time to move on to line by line
chairperson interpretation
if there are no further comments yes we can go line by line
are there any comments
just in case we adjourn early i would like to take a ten minute break
>>committee recesses for ten minutes
chairperson interpretation

thank you for coming back
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
for information purposes for mr akesuk the contracts that we have total $3 983 563 these are the contracts that we have
i apologize for something i said earlier we are not paying for the federal inmates
it is the federal government that pays for the services
i thought we were paying for the whole justice services but for the federal legislation we are not paying for any federal inmates
oh i am sorry when i was talking about the amount of money we were spending on the inmates i may have inadvertently said something wrong here
regarding the federal inmates the government of nunavut is not putting any money into the federal inmates
that is paid for by the government of canada
i just wanted to clarify that
interpretation mr chairman if it is ok with you i would like to recognize two people who are here
i would like to acknowledge nicole campaugh
she was from rankin inlet but she moved to yellowknife and another person who is here from rankin inlet mayor of rankin inlet simon okpatauyak

mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in the middle one under grants and contributions - $510 000 00 i would like to get further clarification on what that is for
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation yes
this $510 000 00 is for the communities
it is the community justice program
perhaps i will talk a little bit about that issue
in baffin region $215 000 00
kitikmeot $94 000 00 and keewatin $13 000 00 total $440 500 00
but the difference the remaining funds could be used for victim assistance programs
this $440 500 00 will be used for community justice programs but the remainder will be for the victims
$60 000 00
is that clear now
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu if you could look at the last page
in the details of grants and contributions there is detailed information here
do you have any further questions
which page are you on 5-11 details of grants and contributions page 5-11
the detailed information is in that page
contributions for community justice initiatives
mr iqaqrialu mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman chairperson interpretation
thank you minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
regarding the $440 000 00 that is geared towards community justice programs if there was a surplus from that program we would not take it back
they would keep it
but i could give you detailed information as to what is allowed to the communities on these funds that are allotted to community justice programs
perhaps i apologize i would like ms sanders to explain this
chairperson interpretation
go ahead ms sanders
ms sanders interpretation
thank you mr chairman
interpretation ends each of the community contributions to the justice committees that we have allocated this year are the same as they received last year
we are also negotiating today and tomorrow with justice canada to see if they will match that funding
that is not a definite thing yet but we are quite optimistic about that
so that would increase the amount for each community
hon jack anawak interpretation
in view of these court system changes perhaps we are now trying to give more responsibility to the community justice committees
although this fund is now $440 500 00 if it is possible to get additional funding from the federal government we will work harder to get the amount larger next year
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the community justice committees i don t know if they are paid honoraria when they deal with these issues if this includes the jp s
i don t know if the jp s get honoraria or if they are paid
i think everyone has to have a clear understanding including myself and my constituency as to what kind of operations and maintenance they have for each community
this is self explanatory but i don t know especially in our community if we have a justice program in our community so i will look into it
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
when the funding is allotted to the communities the community justice committee it is up to their discretion as to how much they would expend there is no criteria given to the committees in the communities
chairperson interpretation
yes in regards to mr iqaqrialus comment it would be easier to understand if it was that way
tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman this is the area that deals with the correctional in paying for the inmates that we send over to ycc and that area is that the amount included in the other o&m in the 6 8 million
i just wanted to get clarification on that
hon jack anawak the budget for offenders held in the nwt is
adult male offenders $4 281 000 00
female offenders $241 000 00 and
young offenders $603 000 00 for a
total of $5 125 000 00 in terms of spending on all the offenders based in the nwt
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i wonder if the amount allocated in the budget takes into consideration the fee that we get charged from the government of the northwest territories only in that area
i was wondering if that is what is budgeted in there
thank you mr chairman
ms sanders
these budget amounts are not all being paid to the gnwt we are not committed to paying those to the nwt
but at any given time we may have as many offenders there as we have here because of the lack of capacity to be here
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i was wondering if that was something that was added on to after or if it has indeed been something that was overlooked
thank you mr chairman
ms sanders interpretation thank you mr chairman
interpretation ends apparently those calculations were estimated as part of the budgets for the corrections facility here
that is where the transportation costs for the inmates were included and we are hoping that they will be adequate

nunavut governments commitment to elders
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i want to share with you our departments commitment to help our elders in nunavut
elders are a very special group of people in our inuit society
our culture is a verbal one
we never had a writing system
our knowledge about our culture and language is passed on through generations of inuit thousands of years ago
our elders are a walking history
their knowledge is filled with inuktitut and inuinnaqtun words that are unknown to our younger society
they are passed on to us through legends spirituality shamanism and inuit traditional songs or phihiit
the inuit ways must not be allowed to disappear
uqartii we must always remember the fact that it is because of our elders that we are here today
uqartii in november 1998 we gathered 26 elders and 26 youth in iqaluktuuttiaq cambridge bay for the first time in our nunavut history
if there was one thing we ve established out of this important conference it was better communication between our elders and youth
that is the way is used to be and that is what it must be today and in the future
our government is committed to continue this dialogue between these two groups
our department is committed to continue these annual conferences
we must place a high priority to our elders
mr speaker each time an elder dies he or she takes with them a whole lot of knowledge about inuit/inuinnaqtun culture and language
it is urgent that all of us in nunavut begin to utilize these people
we need their help
our government is committed to looking what ways of how we can better utilize our elders
uqartii i have asked my department to look into the possibility of establishing this important initiative
i have asked my department to start to assembly and collect the oral history of our nunavut elders and resources which document the history of nunavut
mr speaker much of this materials exists in different locations across the country and it is time to bring it home
doing this is not a luxury - it is something we must do
uqartii i believe and i trust the members here will all share this belief - that our history and our culture is what makes us strong
it is what must be taught to our youth by elders and in the education system if our youth are to be proud knowledgeable and informed about where we have come from
in this fashion they will have a clearer vision of where we need to go
uqartii ahiitlu katimamajiuqatitka i am proud to recognize the importance of my department recording and developing the cultural and historical record on which our nunavut territory is based
in the meantime i would like to take this opportunity in thanking all of our elders in nunavut for their hard work contribution to our lives wisdom guidance and traditional knowledge
let me be heard by the population of nunavut that our government is committed to work towards a betterment of our elders
we must make sure that we start to utilize them in promoting inuit qaujimajatunqangit
that is the way it should be

members statements
members statement 49 - 1 2 importance of decentralized government
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker for over 25 years the people of the eastern arctic have been planning and working toward the realization of having their own government
the dream of nunavut holds many promises and benefits for its people
mr speaker another more far reaching and tangible concept is to have a decentralized government that would bring the government closer to the people which would provide many benefits such as real community empowerment responsibility and much needed employment
mr speaker for twenty some years the power of control rested far away from small nunavut communities
that power base was yellowknife and thus one of the reasons for this new government of nunavut a government closer to the people
mr speaker this brings me to my main point
the people in the smaller less fortunate hamlets of nunavut have been promised a decentralized government
a government closer to the people
mr speaker a decision not to have a decentralized government would be unfair misleading and would create doubt in the real meaning of nunavut
finally mr speaker some people in this government may say we cannot afford a decentralized government
mr speaker i say we cannot afford not to have a decentralized government

mr speaker traditionally fridays members make statements of a lighter or more humorous note
i am not able to do that today as i have to speak to the serious concern that occurred yesterday in this house
mr speaker as indicated in hansard on our orders of the day number 16 notices of motions for first reading of bills and number 18 first reading of bills are very similar mr speaker very similar
after several days of practice rehearsal and method acting training
a member didn t work
>>laughter
hon ed picco
i was able to pull off a totally realistic portrayal of a minister mistaken in the orders of the day
indeed mr speaker my portrayal was so realistic mr ng the house leader many of the members the tv audience and indeed the media were fooled into thinking i didn t know the difference between number 16 and number 18
>>laughter
mr speaker later today i will be prepared to give acting lessons to the members and i will also take this opportunity to thank the members for your help and consideration on the process
mr speaker i will be picking up the oscar on the break later today and i invite the members to attend with me

payroll deductions nunavut teachers and staff
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
as we are a new government we are going to be asking a lot of questions about what we should be doing
one of the questions that has been pointed out to me is that interpretation ends deductions which are going to the plans like unemployment canada pension plan retirement and so on
this was done by the government of the northwest territories federal government before nunavut became a reality
so they are concerned about losing out just because they have been transferred to the nunavut government it would be good if the teachers in my constituency could be reassured that they are not going to lose out
members statement 52 - 1 2
congratulations on success of session
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes thank you
first i am very proud that this has been a very successful session of the legislative assembly this week
i think that even though we have never really been involved in a legislative assembly we should be proud of ourselves in the way we have conducted ourselves this week
even though we did some stumbling overall i think this week has been a good beginning and we should all be proud of ourselves in our success this week
i think it shows among the members that they have a sense of humour they are willing to learn from their mistakes and i would like to congratulate all the members for this successful week

question 67 - 1 2
translation of legislation
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this morning in caucus we were dealing with proposed bills
i have a question for mr ng
if we are going to be proposing bills i would suggest that all the proposed bills be in both inuktitut and english
my problem was there were some things missing in inuktitut
i would suggest that everything be properly translated if they are going to be done into inuktitut
that is for a clarification
speaker
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i don t know if there was a question there but i would like to respond
the government is cognizant of the fact that legislation must be understood before we pass legislation
i think it is just the logistics right now the logistics and the significant expertise to actually draft legislation and whether that is able to be done in syllabics in its entirety
i think what the government would propose probably is that the intent of the bill the legislation summaries would certainly be available in syllabics but right now it is the logistics of working out that process

business incentive policy
mr o brien

mr speaker my question is to the minister responsible for public works telecommunications & technical services
in reference to the bip the business incentive policy i wonder if the minister can tell the members whether there have been any changes to that policy
i understand that it has been transferred from the gnwt into the nunavut government whether or not any changes have been made to the old policy and if companies in nunavut have copies of it
thank you
speaker
thank you two questions
minister of public works telecommunications & technical services ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
the business incentive policy of the government is ongoing until we have come up as a government with a new policy for this government
so it is continuing until we come up with something else including article 24 we have to work with that policy for this government
thank you
speaker
thank you ms thompson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker from those comments i assume that there have been no changes in the old bip

thank you mr o brien
minister thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
i understand that the cabinet i know we have approved an interim nunavut bip and contract procedures which will not be disrupting any projects that are ongoing for this summer

transfer of staff from gnwt to nunavut government
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the transferring from the government of the northwest territories to the nunavut government
the teachers there are quite a number of teachers out there in the nunavut territories
were hoping to increase the number of teachers to keep up with the student ratio
education is very important to our young people and the teachers in the nunavut territory are concerned about their salary deductions
that s the question i ve been hearing and i direct this question to minister of education
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr arvaluk minister of education
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i m very happy to respond to this question
on april 1st for the teachers and the staff at the schools deductions were transferred to the nunavut government from the government of the northwest territories
we have grandfathered the system from the gnwt during the transfer from the gnwt and there are not going to be any changes
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would also like to thank the minister of education for responding to my question but i have another question to the same minister because there s some employees out there who are confused
i would like to ask the minister if the teachers have had correspondence in regards to the deductions
for example in uqsuqtuuq i would like to see letters sent to the teachers and the employees of the schools on what system they re using whether they re using the same system that was used by the gnwt

oral questions mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu
interpretation
thank you mr speaker this question is for the minister of public works
when we were still under the government of the nwt some of the staff housing were sold and bought privately but these staff houses that were bought were not renovated
are there any plans to renovate the existing staff houses that were bought by the public
it caused quite a concern and some of the people who bought these old staff houses had some problems because the houses that were bought were very old
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the people who bought those houses knew that these houses were old
once they bought them they are no longer our responsibility and they become the responsibility of the people who bought them
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
oral questions mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
when the old staff houses were put up for sale they should have been renovated before they were sold
i don t know why they didn t do that and of course when they were bought they were no longer the responsibility of the government
i would suggest that if we re going to be selling the staff housing and any of the assets that we hold i would suggest that we renovate the housing or what ever assets that we re going to be selling
if we sell old buildings some of the people who buy these houses are not rich and it causes a problem it caused a problem
thank you mr speaker i would like this to be considered
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister of public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the staff housing that were put up for sale were very cheap
when you are buying housing you re talking about $250 thousand dollars to buy a house
the staff housing we sold were going much cheaper
for the smaller communities that don t have private homes i m sure the price tag seemed very high and if we re going to be selling staff housing after they ve been renovated i don t think that s a very good idea
we sold them as is
if we re going to be renovating before we sell them we re going to be using a lot more money out of our budget
the people who bought those houses now own those and they are no longer our responsibility

bill 2 - boards of management dissolution act
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
i was looking forward to this
mr speaker i move seconded by the member for pangnirtung bill 2 the boards of management dissolution act be read for the second time
mr speaker today i m introducing a piece of legislation entitled the boards of management dissolution act
this legislation allows the government to ensure a smooth transition over the next year as we work with boards towards the new health and social services for the people of nunavut
before i continue mr speaker i would like to take this opportunity to commend the trustees of our health and social services boards for their service over the years
the boards ensured that the people of nunavut played a role in their own affairs during the time as a minority in the northwest territories
but this is a new territory and a new day we have our own government now and we as residents of nunavut are well represented by the 19 mlas in this house
the decision to take a different approach in providing health and social services to nunavummiut has been guided by two important principles
first we want to be accountable we want to ensure that this government is responsible and responsive to the people of nunavut
we want to bring this government closer to the people we all represent and work directly with all our communities
second we want to be efficient
as we have already discussed publicly estimates show that we will be able to re-direct significant monies mr speaker into programs and services as a result of the impending decision
in short we want to ensure a nunavut based approach taking advantage of what our communities have in common while still taking into account their uniqueness
i want to point out mr speaker phasing out the boards will not affect the day to day delivery of programs and services to our clients in nunavut
the services provided by all health and social services workers in each region will continue to serve the public

bill 3 - divisional education councils dissolution act
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will be speaking in inuktitut but your interpreters have a copy
mr speaker it gives me a great deal of pleasure to stand before you today to introduce this piece of legislation entitled divisional education councils dissolution act
the school boards in nunavut now known as the divisional education councils were originally created to give the residents of the eastern arctic a voice in the government of the nwt
with nunavut that concern no longer exists
the responsibility for the delivery of these services will now be transferred to the elected leaders of the people of nunavut
all of us have a role in the important social function of educating our children
we envision an environment in which responsibilities and accountabilities are clearly defined beginning with a positive partnership between the student the parent and the teachers supported by a motivated and challenged community and district education authority
mr speaker education is a fundamental and important to the success of nunavut and this piece of legislation is a first step in building our new future in nunavut

weekend fire in iqaluit
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker a fire broke out in a six-apartment social housing unit in iqaluit early sunday morning despite the concerted efforts of the iqaluit fire department to save the unit the unit was totally destroyed
as a result 20 people are now homeless thanks to the iqaluit fire department we are fortunate that there were no serious injuries or loss of life
fires such as this are always tragic events
i want to extend my sympathy to those who lost their homes so suddenly over the weekend
i want to assure them that i will be working with the iqaluit housing authority and my colleagues to find alternate accommodations as quickly as possible

ministers statement 16 - 1 2
decentralization
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today to make something very clear to the members of this house and the people of nunavut
mr speaker the nunavut government is firmly committed to decentralization
our government was founded on the basis of bringing government closer to the people and make no mistake mr speaker we will do just that
we are proceeding with decentralization as we speak
in arviat the four employees of the department of education will soon be joined by twenty-three others
currently the department is in the process of advertising for these positions which will come on stream once the office space is available over the coming months
three staff from e department of community government housing & transportation are in place and two more will be out for competition shortly
the department of sustainable development has moved the four regional positions that were scheduled to be transferred into this community
mr speaker the residents of baker lake can rest assured that decentralization is moving ahead in their community
the department of education will soon be hiring four additional staff to complement those already on the ground
the department of community government housing & transportation currently has three of its baker lake positions out for competition and three more will be out before our next sitting
in igloolik the department of culture language elders & youth has six employees and they will soon be joined by approximately twenty more in the coming months
in addition one position from community government housing & transportation is out for competition
further west mr speaker cambridge bay has already begun to see the benefits of decentralization
positions in the departments of human resources and culture language elders & youth have been staffed
rankin inlet mr speaker also has begun the staffing process
employees in three departments are based there including two of our assistant deputy ministers
the department of health and social services is currently increasing its staffing level from nine to thirteen
one person has been hired from community government housing & transportation to work in gjoa haven and five more positions are currently out to competition
for kugluktuk two positions from the department of community government housing & transportation are staffed and three more are out to competition and will be filled during the next few months
all of the regional positions with the department of sustainable development except two have been moved into kugluktuk
one position from cape dorset is out for competition right now and six more will be advertised within the coming two months
mr speaker the communities of pond inlet and pangnirtung will soon be receiving jobs as they are transferred out of iqaluit
this process will take place over a varied time frame depending on departmental planning and infrastructure
these positions i have mentioned mr speaker are just the beginning
mr speaker the nunavut implementation commission and the office of the interim commissioner developed our basis for decentralization
as decentralization is an important issue that affects all departments the department of the executive has been assigned the difficult task of co-ordinating our decentralization efforts and ensuring that decentralization is implemented
and mr speaker this will be a difficult task
we are setting out to decentralize in a manner that no government in canada has ever done
we will decentralize but we must ensure that our programs and services to people in nunavut are not adversely affected
we must do this in a thoughtful well planned manner that allows communities to prepare for the inevitable social impacts
this mr speaker takes time
decentralization was never intended to take place overnight
we as cabinet understand the importance of decentralization to our communities
but it is important to realize that not all pieces of the puzzle are in place
our people are not fully trained to take many of the positions that will flow from decentralization
mr speaker in the coming weeks and months we will present to the regular mla s and the people of nunavut detailed implementation plans which will outline exactly how decentralization will be accomplished
in this house i mentioned that the department of the executive would be studying the options for implementing the decentralization plan
regular mla s will be involved in this process
mr speaker i thank those members who brought this issue to the forefront
we as cabinet look forward to working with them to ensure that community concerns are properly addressed
i am confident that if we all work together we will do what is right for nunavut

mr speaker i wish to thank the premier for his strong commitment and assurance that decentralization will take place in the smaller less fortunate communities in nunavut
mr speaker decentralization is the corner stone for a better quality of life for all the people in nunavut
these statements today by our premier take a heavy burden off our youth who are now seeing a ray of light and hope for future employment with the new of the government of nunavut

weekend fire in iqaluit
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to rise this afternoon to express my most sincere sympathies for the families who were so tragically rendered homeless on sunday in this community by a fire
i am gratified for the ministers response to this tragedy however this unhappy incident clearly demonstrates that contingency plans need to be in place to deal with incidents such as these
no one can predict when something like this will happen and while we should all be grateful nobody was killed or seriously injured the burden on these people is still tremendous
those iqalummiutait who have opened their hearts and their homes to the victims deserve our greatest respect

question 71 - 1 2
secondary school design for baker lake
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the minister of education regarding the jonah amitnak secondary school in baker lake that was built 1957 and added to in the 60 s
according to the current building codes it is not worth renovating and it s not up to standards
there was 300 hundred thousand put in the budget this year for designing a new school and i was advised by the baker lake district education authority that the project was scrapped this year
can the minister answer me as to why this project was scrapped this year

question 72 - 1 2
western premiers conference
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker in the premier s statement regarding the conference of western premiers the premier indicated that there was some discussion regarding a memorandum between the premiers which alluded to a road connection between nunavut and manitoba
i m wondering if the minister could elaborate a little more to i guess the discussions as related to the road and also the power grid that we spoke about a number of weeks ago between the keewatin and manitoba
speaker
qujannamiik mr o brien
premier okalik
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
the only agreement that was discussed was with the premier of the northwest territories and the government leader for the yukon government
speaker
interpretation thank you mr premier
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
i thought we heard the premier of manitoba just last night on the radio indicating that he strongly supported the road linkage between manitoba and the keewatin or nunavut
can the premier tell me whether or not these discussions took place and in what degree
thank you
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr o brien
our premier mr okalik
hon paul okalik
i discussed it briefly with the premier of manitoba he is a very strong supporter of a road to nunavut but we did not get into detailed discussions
i was more focused on getting support from all the premiers in western canada and that s what we received as a government from all the western premiers for a highway to nunavut from southern canada
speaker
interpretation thank you mr okalik
third question mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it s my understanding that there s been a committee active i guess for the last two years that was comprised of the gnwt and i believe the interim commissioner s office at that time and the manitoba government
they were basically put together to study a road linkage and power grid and the result is a study apparently finished sometime in march
i wonder if the premier is aware of any of the conclusions or the decisions that were made upon the completion of the report
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
the question was directed to the premier would you like to answer

the minister of transportation will be able to reply in more detail on that report

question 73 - 1 2
government response to fire in iqaluit
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker this weekend the public housing inventory in iqaluit took a six unit hit as a result of a fire
the current waiting list is around 70 right now for public housing and as we just heard from the minister responsible for housing earlier there are now 20 more people that are homeless
i would like to ask the minister if there are any preliminary plans as a result of this prior to looking into replacing those units
thank you mr speaker
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
thank you mr speaker
but i can assure you that the department is doing everything it can to at least respond to the people who are left homeless but also in the long run to respond to the severe housing shortage

oral questions mr puqiqnak
question 74 - 1 2
repatriation of artifacts
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the minister of culture language elders and youth
mr speaker our nunavut fathers have had their pictures taken since the 1800 s by people from around the world who travelled here by whalers and other ships and somewhere in the 1900 s by dogteam
a lot of pictures have been taken since that time in the nunavut area and these artifacts are outside of canada and i believe that they should by rights be here in nunavut
i believe that there are many photographs that have been taken by the southerners i feel we should get all our artifacts and photographs and this should be a priority for the nunavut government
i believe that we must bring our artifacts and photographs which have been taken many many years ago back
these are part of our homeland and i am seeking an answer from the minister of culture language elders and youth about bringing all of these artifacts and photographs back to our homeland
thank you
speaker
thank you mr puqiqnak
two questions
mr havioyak minister of culture
hon donald havioyak interpretation
yes i do understand your questions quite clearly and i do appreciate you very much for asking that question
all of my employees and staff members are working on all these issues to get all our artifacts back and also the photographs that you are talking about that are in museums
we all know that they are elsewhere and i know that we have to have a building in place first before we can start collecting these
these are our major concern as well and all the people that i have spoken to are concerned about this matter
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
third question mr puqiqnak
second question
mr puqiqnak
mr speaker today our new generation and our younger people want to know what is their culture with their own eyes
today older people talk about their culture by telling them a story
just by talking
our younger children today s generation want to understand and they want to see their fathers
without a museum in nunavut mr speaker it is going to be difficult for us and for the new generation
will the minister tell us what his plans are to ensure that the young people in each community can see with their own eyes their history and culture
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation
yes this is part of our work as well and right now i would like to let you know that we are not just working here in the house we are also working with other organizations as well
we are working on this museum that you are talking about
as i stated before we are working together so that our younger generation will understand our history
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
supplementary question mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
there is a demand out there and it won t be very much if we have to go to copenhagen to see our history our culture and our clothing
usually the people who are not from nunavut are the ones that are telling our history about the people of nunavut
all the money is going to copenhagen instead of going up to the nunavut territory
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
i believe he answered that question but if he would like to make a supplementary response he is free to do so
mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak
many of these artifacts are all over the place and we know that they are not in nunavut
they are somewhere else and we need to repatriate those back from the nwt the rest of canada and even in copenhagen
those are artifacts that we own and we i think we are preparing to repatriate those back to nunavut
so we are making preparations at this time and i also mentioned earlier that we need to have a place for storing them so we can set up a museum so that these artifacts can be placed in nunavut
today we are working at it at this time

oral questions
mr alakannuark
question 75 - 1 2
status of nurse recruitment
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is to the minister of health and social services about the nurses in the communities
when are you going to be recruiting more nurses in the smaller communities
many of the communities have only one nurse and sometimes there are two but when are you going to be up to par in the smaller communities for the recruitment of nurses
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker the responsibility for the hiring and staffing of nurses right now is with the regional health boards
indeed mr speaker the health boards are very active in trying to secure nurses for our communities
from the departments point of view we are working on the recruitment and retention program for our nursing staff
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
mr alakannuark did you have a second question
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the reason i am asking this question and i think i understand your response but in the communities we have more chronic illness present and especially with babies that are getting sick
so the nurses have to work around the clock in the health centres in the communities and once a young baby becomes ill people become very concerned and they take their babies to the nursing station right away
so we need to have adequate nurses in the health centres to deal with the viruses that are happening in the communities
speaker

capital plan for qikiqtarjuaq

thank you mr speaker this is directed to the minister of community government housing and transportation
one of the communities that i represent which is qikiqtarjuaq according to the capital plan for 1999/2000 there are no projects slated for that community
i wonder if that community has any projects planned for up to the year 2000

oral questions
mr nutarak
question 77 - 1 2
leave and replacement policy for nurses
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is directed to the minister of health and social services
the nurses in the small communities sometimes take a long holiday or take long absences do you have anything in place for replacing them
speaker
thank you mr nutarak
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to take this opportunity just to say that the earlier comment from the member from pelly bay is correct
we realize that the nurses are under a lot of stress in our communities
the department right now is working on a recruitment and retention plan to help those nurses
there are contingency plans in place
if there was a specific problem in the community where there was absenteeism of a nurse or a requirement for work and there was no one there then maybe we could specifically deal with that
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
second question mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
some of the nurses are in the community for a long time
they don t change and do you have a program for how often a nurse should be taking leave from a community or before replacing them
is it just up to the nurse how long she wants to stay in a community or do you have some kind of policy in place for this
speaker interpretation thank you mr nutarak
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my understanding is that if a nurse chose to be in a community then it is up to her or him as the case may be
if the nurse chose to move to another community then the health board would try to make that accommodation
but again it depends on the operational requirements and the need in the community
that is my understanding mr speaker

question 78 - 1 2
contract for transitional plans on health and education boards
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is to the premier and i ll understand if the premier doesn t have all the details to provide to the house but today if he could possibly give some background
you were absent at the time mr premier and the response was that they were not aware that the contract may have been awarded
mr picco responded later in a written response that indeed it was awarded to a mr david ramsden the former minister or deputy minister rather of health and social services of the nwt
i wonder mr premier whether or not you could provide us with some details as to how the contract was awarded whether it was sole source and the value of the contract
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
mr o brien when you are asking a question please refer to the speaker

it relates to the minister of health portfolio i believe that my colleague could answer that question
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr premier
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my understanding is that it is not an actual contract that is in place
it is actually an employment contract
the person has been hired by the department of the executive to do projects on behalf of the government
one of those projects indeed would be looking at the amalgamation of the health boards into one what type of an organizational plan would we have in place after march 31/2000

mr speaker it is not a study
it is an employment contract
working for the department
it is not a contract so it wouldn t have been issued on an rfp
he has been hired
he is an employee i don t know if that clarifies how the man has been put in place
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
third supplementary mr o brien
excuse me mr o brien your mike
mr o brien
mr speaker
and it is my understanding i believe that mr ramsden was the deputy of health and social services in the gnwt when we had such very very serious problems with our health care in the keewatin
and i will get back to my question
was there not anybody else in nunavut who could have done this work
call it a study call it work call it employment whatever
i am sure it is a short-term project that will end in a few months so that is the question
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i don t think anyone here wants to look at or try to begrudge or impugn any type of handling of a job done by someone previously
i don t think that is what we are here for
i think the point is that mr ramsden had the expertise he had specialized knowledge he did work with the boards when they were under the gnwt
he has actually worked on a doctoral thesis
he has the expertise needed
specialized expertise familiarity with our boards the operating structures of the department of health as it is right now and indeed looking at the reorganization of same
if there is someone in nunavut that could do it i don t know
the point was mr speaker that indeed the announcement was only made three short weeks ago
i met with the health board people we wanted to get someone in place right away the members here have asked for the organizational chart we cannot have it both ways
so the person has the expertise he is on the ground he is working right now he is on a contract with the executive there is no hiding of any facts
there is no mystery no controversy indeed mr speaker there is nothing being hidden here
it is all open
so i would like to say again i guess that the guy has the expertise and specialized knowledge and everything
and i wouldn t want to impugn any motive as to what he was doing previously when he was the deputy minister
i think the point has been made that the guy was hired
he is on a short-term contract
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
final supplementary question
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it is not my intention to impute a motive here
i am just stating a fact
i know that this individual was involved with the study of the keewatin health board and we had such serious serious complications in matters over there and now we have hired the same individual
to revisit this and to review some of the type or promote some of the type of model that we may put into place
my question simply is did we look at anybody else that could have done this type of a job or study review or what you want to call it
thank you
speaker
thank you mr picco or mr o brien sorry
mr picco minister of health
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i mean the member is referring to a previous government it is not relevant to this government what happened with that guy with mr ramsden in the past
i don t know mr ramsden very well personally or anything
i think the guy has good professional qualifications
i did see him briefly in ottawa when i was down there to meet with the minister the honourable allan rock and spoke to him on it
has the department of executive gone out and done an ad for the position i don t think they have
they tried to find the person to do the job who has the expertise the knowledge and familiarity with nunavut with the health boards that is a pretty unique position
so i would say to the member i don t know if the department of the executive has placed an ad i did not hire him
he was not hired through my department he was hired through the department of executive but i am fully confident that mr ramsden has the ability to do the job
and again the point here mr speaker is that we wanted to fast track this organizational plan
we just made the announcement about four weeks ago now with the health boards requesting the organizational chart as well as the chairs of the health boards and the ceo s
that is what we are trying to expedite here
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
i would like to advise the members to be careful about asking questions about things that happened in the past
this is a new government this is a different government not accountable for the previous government thank you oral questions

question 79 - 1 2
status of negotiations on james bay islands
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i asked this question previously to the premier but i will redirect my question
regarding the offshore islands i wonder what is the status of the negotiations on the james bay islands
speaker
thank you mr kattuk
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
next week and today the james bay cree will be meeting with my officials
this week just to identify the problem areas or concerns from both parties
we are presently just trying to identify the issues at hand
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr okalik
oral questions mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the reason i am asking this question is that the people of sanikiluaq are living in proximity to those islands and they are concerned about future use of those islands that are currently being used by the sanikiluaq people
sanikiluaq people are concerned about not taking part in the discussions and also in the agreement
they are worried that they will be restricted in the use of those islands which they have used traditionally for harvesting
that is why the residents of sanikiluaq are concerned
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
mr okalik
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as i stated earlier if there are going to be actual negotiations and an agreement the people of sanikiluaq will be involved
the inuit are also able to hunt outside of the traditional harvesting areas and i would just like to further add that the inuit are not restricted to harvesting in the traditional areas

oral questions mr irqittuq
question 80 - 1 2 use of government facilities by contractors
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am not sure which minister i should be directing my question to
perhaps it is to the premier or it may be going to ms thompson
the contracts with the government of the northwest territories
we have adopted many of the contracts that were initiated by the gnwt and we have inherited them as nunavut
those contractors mr speaker who will be maintaining the present infrastructure
hon manitok thompson interpretation
perhaps the member can clarify what exactly what he is talking about
i think what he said was that the people who are building the garages and the other government infrastructure is he saying that the contractors should be fixing their vehicles and what not
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
mr irqittuq could you clarify your question please
mr irqittuq interpretation
yes thank you mr speaker that is the question
for example in the arctic airports garage would they be able to use the arctic airports facilities even though they are just working on contracts speaker
ms thompson hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
whatever needs to be fixed on the government contracts no matter what contract it is they re able use the facilities that are available in a community
thank you
speaker interpretation thank you ms thompson
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
thank you mr speaker

mr nutarak
question 81 - 1 2
recruitment of social workers
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in the smaller communities the social workers are getting fewer and fewer and when people have quit they have not been replaced
what is this department doing to recruit for those positions that have become vacant this is in the area of social work
thank you speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
this is for mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
one of the most important positions or jobs in our smaller communities indeed in all of our communities is the social worker
what we ve tried to do as a department through the health boards again the social workers are employees of the health boards when a position is vacant the health board works towards filling those positions
the training of social workers is a different aspect
there have been some training programs going on at nunavut arctic college
we ve had programs for social workers we just had seven recently graduate
in igloolik as an example we have seven social workers that are involved in a training program
they have finished their certificates and now would like to go on to the diploma program and as a department we are helping to facilitate that

school buses in iqaluit
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker last week on the 19th i made a members statement regarding the concerns in iqaluit here about bussing
my question to the minister responsible for education is has any of the staff discussed the need for more bussing here in iqaluit due to the forced growth that we are facing
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
mr speaker the bussing programs are done by standard criteria for each community
and if that happens then bussing will also be looked at
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker could i please ask the minister to repeat that due to technical problem i did not hear the answer
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
can you rephrase your answer mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr speaker
the bussing program is status quo from the northwest territories government
the criteria for bussing services to all communities are the same throughout nunavut
if there is an increased requirement for iqaluit bussing if that comes about that will be looked at
i cannot answer that right now because we haven t been told about actual enrolments and requirements
as soon as that arrives into our department through the divisional board then we will look at that immediately
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
second question mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the minister is saying that his department has not to date received any correspondence or any concern from either the iqaluit education authority or the district education council regarding bussing
is that what he is saying

replies to budget address
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
a little over a week ago my honourable colleague from cambridge bay presented nunavut s first budget in this house
in making my reply today i am mindful of the fact that ministers of finance across this country do not have the easiest of jobs
when times are difficult they are the ones who have to go back and say no
when times are good they are still the ones who have to sometimes say no to a request for new or expanded funding
as members though we have an obligation to stand up for our community
it is not easy for any of us to return our communities and be faced with questions as to what we could and could not achieve for them
the minister s budget as we recognize it is essentially a status quo budget
neither ministers nor regular members had the level of input into its development that i hope to see for the next year
the fact that the minister did not announce any new programs reinforces that we have the opportunity now to think clearly and deeply about our collective goals in the future
in his opening remarks the minister referred to changes that are in the planning stages and to substantial reforms that will require study and consultation
i am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak to some of the priorities and aspirations of the people of baker lake
standing on our own two feet achieving real self-sufficiency is a theme that i applaud
we all know the fiscal realities facing nunavut - our dependence on federal transfers the unfair way in which nunavut is denied it s fair share of resource revenues i could go on but the tale has been told before
the minister s budget address is admirable in the way in which he pledges to fight for nunavut s fair share
what we need to do as a territory and a people is to move from dialogue and then to action on how we can provide more for ourselves
real decentralization is a step a job and a spin off in nunavut s smaller communities will help to kick-start local economies
i again urge the government to move forward quickly on this issue
the budget address touched on the vital issue of economic development and increasing employment opportunities
it referred to efforts to develop a northern economic strategy and an economic development agreement in partnership with the federal government
i am pleased to see the minister of sustainable development promoting nunavut during his recent trip to montreal
it is vital that the message be heard elsewhere in canada and abroad that we are open to investment that we are open to partnerships that we are open for business
the creation of a nunavut appropriate investment fund would be an initiative that i would support
the premier s participation in last weeks premier s conference shows that we are finding our voice and finding forums in which our voice can be amplified
the support of the western provinces and our northern neighbours for a highway linked to nunavut is gratifying
i applaud the premier for his efforts
the conference also called for strong efforts to be made in the field of trade development and tourism
we need a team nunavut approach to these issues
we are all stakeholders that are involved
an economic strategy for nunavut must be holistic being content with make work programs or indiscriminate subsidies is not a sustainable path to pursue
incentive programs must be carefully thought out and avoid the traps made in the past by other governments
our future depends to no small extent on the people of this land creating their own wealth through the traditional economy
our current situation where the government takes in more than twice as much money from tobacco taxes as it does from corporate income taxes is simply unacceptable we are a large territory with few people
our economy has to grow based on our core strengths both natural and human
education is absolutely central to this
as a strategic investment in our future education must in a word include resources and get first call on additional funds as it is through education that we gain strength
a person with education and skill has a choice to work for him or herself to join the public service to start a business that will in turn provide a job for others
education and health go hand in hand
i was pleased for my colleague the member for arviat that his community will see the benefits of a p3 project a new health centre
i support the principle of p3 when projects focus on the education and health needs of nunavut
mr speaker the minister s budget stressed the governments commitment to consultation and to integrating the values of our people into how we make decisions
the months ahead will put us all to the test mr speaker
i look forward to joining the challenge
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
replies to budget address mr akesuk
mr akesuk
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker many of my concerns were addressed by the honourable kelvin ng minister of finance
however in my constituency where i serve the people of kimmirut and cape dorset there continues to be many areas of concerns to all of us
housing education and decentralization are among a few
understandably housing is an issue to all the members and to the people of nunavut
even in ottawa a standing committee report of the house of commons concluded that the shortage of housing and high cost of air transportation are crippling and restrict economic development efforts
since our first and second session it is obvious that this issue continues to be an important subject
mr speaker the promotion of home ownership seems to be a catch 22 situation
however this program has been less successful here because of the higher cost of houses in nunavut
in my constituency there are an average of 4 people living in each household while 40% have five or more people per household
i am certain that this is a similar situation in every community
i will quote from the budget address the availability of adequate and affordable housing to meet the needs of our growing population is one of our highest infrastructure priorities
mr speaker 117 4 million dollars is going towards education
this must be used wisely
we need to educate our youth and prepare them for future employment
we must provide quality education
education that is geared towards specialized areas such as schoolteachers nurses and much more
another area of education that we have talked a lot of as well as is the need of preserve our culture our language taking care of our land hunting and harvesting
the need for inuit qaujimajatunqangit to be integrated with our government
we must consider the needs of our youth
they are our future leaders and must be given every opportunity to succeed
mr speaker recently the mayor of cape dorset expressed concerned on the radio about decentralization
the decentralization model that was approved on october 2 1998 indicated that 56 full time positions were slated for cape dorset
forty-one of these positions were to be transferred from iqaluit
no positions were slated for kimmirut
mr speaker before being elected i worked as an employment assistance officer in our community
we used to partner with the government inuit organizations and lending agencies when funds were not sufficient for a particular project
with this budget these are the types of things that we will have to do
mr speaker i am hopeful that this year s budget covers these issues
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr akesuk
replies to budget address
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i am pleased to have the opportunity to reply to the budget address
i would like to touch on several themes that are very important to me and mr speaker not all the themes that are important to me
this is quite lengthy but it is scaled back so please bear with me
the first theme is housing
mr speaker i am pleased to see 20 million dollars allocated for social housing
i think it is important that we make a distinction between social housing and other types of housing
mr speaker there has been a growing private market for housing especially in the regional centres as more and more people build or purchase their own housing
however we have had to make hard decisions about where to put limited public dollars
do we help those people who already have money for housing
or do we help those who do not have money for housing
it that simple
social housing programs help people who do not have money for housing
so that all people can have access to affordable safe adequate uncrowded quality housing
mr speaker i think the government of nunavut should put its priority for housing in public housing
mr speaker sometimes when we use expressions like social housing we don t have a good image of who we re talking about in this housing
let me try to express this
mr speaker there is a need for appropriate social housing for elders in all of our communities
it should be appropriately located in the community to be close for walking to stores the nursing station the community hall the elders centre and appropriately designed for elders who have difficulty with steps
there is also a need for social housing for young families for students at high school or college for single mothers and their children who are often living in crowded situations with others
while i know that our history often involves several generations of people living together and we celebrate this and sometimes we long for this closeness in some ways times have changed in many of our communities
where there is conflict in families related to alcohol abuse or violence everyone should have the right the right mr speaker to live in their own housing whether you are an elder a mother or a young adult
there are many people in nunavut who do not have that right now because we don t have the housing to make that right possible
mr speaker there is also a need for social housing for many hard working families who have low incomes and don t enjoy the extra benefits of housing allowances
mr speaker we all know that market rents in the north are often around 2 000 dollars a month for a family sized dwelling
social housing allows for people to pay up to 30% of their salary on housing whether the salary is very low and only part time or whether their salary is modest
they can use the rest for food and for other essentials for their families
mr speaker we need social housing for these people too
lastly mr speaker we need social housing for people who have none at all
there are homeless people in nunavut and iqaluit something that should shame us all
we have a homeless shelter in iqaluit that struggles to stay open when we have people literally freezing to death
as examples of the difficulties they face only in the last few weeks the staff received their layoff notices the consequence of sporadic project funding
mr speaker sadly we do need to have places for people to put their heads at night and the budget needs to reflect all of these housing priorities
mr speaker this is what social housing is all about and we need to have more in every community
unfortunately 20 million dollars won t fulfil enough building of social housing units
mr speaker cmhc used to have a social housing program which built new social housing units
about seven years ago they stopped building new units and so the local housing associations are simply maintaining units they have and rebuilding the ones that are burnt down
we need to re-negotiate the contract with cmhc so that we can once again have new capital and a program for social housing
we need to look at how to creatively build more social housing out of our own limited capital and o&m dollars
mr speaker the budget address states that the government is extending the program to help people with the down payments towards homeownership
mr speaker this will help people move out of social housing and free up that unit for another family
helping people with a down payment is a great boost for many people and i commend the government for doing it
people should only get help that they require to make their down payment and secure a mortgage not more
those who are earning more should pay more towards their down payment
we also have to look at each housing market
houses in iqaluit are very expensive and in some other communities they are less expensive
mr speaker there are many aspects to being able to buy a home the first of these is the desire to do so and the government can be commended for encouraging people to become home owners
the second is a down payment which i just mentioned
the 3rd is a long term job with a regular salary from which to make mortgage payments and keep up the unit
i know this government is committed in many ways to create these jobs but mr speaker there may be other hurdles
there are some people who might have all three now but because they don t have a good credit rating they can t get a mortgage
but if they were to pay off this debt by a repayment schedule they could fix this
mr speaker if we are going to have programs to help people access something as important as housing we need a companion program to help people deal with some of these other hurdles
to get credit counselling to help them consolidate their debts to get a repayment plan so that they could move forward with their lives
this affects many inuit and we need to put extra effort so that more inuit can benefit from these types of program
mr speaker we need general financial services in our communities to ensure that people receive information and support on how to run their financial affairs
from help with income tax forms to obtaining mortgages and loans to setting up their own businesses to obtaining credit counselling
people need help holding on to their homes and assets during difficult periods
mr speaker i believe community based credit unions may be our hope for this credit unions owned and operated locally with the profits in the community and in nunavut
i look forward to seeing the government initiatives in regards to this in the future
mr speaker in terms of housing i also note that the housing corporation has now been brought within the government departments
a stand alone housing corporation was set up after a thorough study in 1972
i suggest that it would help resolve a number of problems it would consolidate all services relating to housing in one place under leadership with a dedicated focus to housing in order to become more effective and efficient
over the years it has evolved through experience to a corporation which did pretty well with what it had to work with
it was also flexible for example it had a two year capital delivery cycle which worked well in nunavut with the sea lift schedule
mr speaker i have many more concerns about housing but i want to quickly raise a few other matters today
mr speaker another area that i care very much about is education and i have two small children who will be entering the education system soon
i want the best for them and for all the other children of nunavut
i want an education system that will instil a love of learning and curiosity about the world
that will invest children with the skills and knowledge that will allow them to contribute to their communities
that will put them on par with the students in southern canada
that will allow them to celebrate skilfully the use of the language and culture and give them a solid foundation for their future lives based on respect and excellence
mr speaker i am pleased to see seventeen new teaching positions will be added this year
we all know the ratio of teachers to students in the classrooms is a very important component of quality education however i am concerned that this increase is not even one new teacher per community
for a community like iqaluit we are seeing many new families moving with their children
this increase in teachers won t even begin to deal with the new numbers of children
it is expected that class sizes will increase here we must look at the need for teachers again before the year is out
perhaps this is an area where some of the savings from phasing out the regional education council can be emphasized
mr speaker another theme that i would like to speak on is caring
they may have turned to drugs and alcohol or to violence and they have a negative impact on themselves and on many people all around them
they are the people who are in the courts and in the prisons and they are in the hospitals from suicide attempts
they can t keep their jobs or their children may be in foster care
mr speaker we have a drug and alcohol centre in iqaluit that is closed
it is the only one in nunavut and they don t even know when it s going to be re-opened
there are many people in nunavut who need this help i don t see anything in this budget that says how we are going to help people deal with a troubled past
i don t think it is enough to build a better future for them we also have to help them move forward with their lives into the better future
more employment opportunities will not be the full answer not the total solution
where are the initiatives to help men and women in the jails deal with their anger and violence and to learn new skills
we know a lot of what has been delivered in the past hasn t always helped people how is nunavut is going to be different
mr speaker the budget talks about shuffling government structures around phasing out health boards and education boards phasing in the departments
mr speaker i don t think a lot of my constituents really care that much about who is going to be doing what or what part of government democracy is responsible for what type of program
my constituents and nunavummiut want programs that will work that are culturally sensitive and that make a difference in their life in the lives of the people they love and are concerned about
mr speaker i would have liked to see more on our caring programs in the budget address more than one paragraph and i hope we will hear more about this in the future
mr speaker the last theme i want to touch on is a need to work together as regular mla s
i want to work effectively with the other mla s in the house and on the standing committees
i want to work effectively with the cabinet and the government departments to ensure that we can deliver the best programs and services possible in nunavut in a way that is affordable sustainable cultural and builds our future

thank you mr nutarak
we will then go to bill one appropriation act 1999/2000 and for your information we also have a standing committee report 1-1 standing committee report 2-1 and standing committee report 3-1
these will also have to be included
that is for your information
at this time i believe it would be best if we deal with community government housing and transportation
we will deal with that first
are we agreed
i would like to ask the minister of this department - community government housing and transportation mr jack anawak to go up to the witness table for opening remarks
hon jack anawak interpretation
as you are aware community government housing and transportation used to be three departments during the gnwt days transportation housing and maca
they were combined into one department and we were able to realign our department this amalgamation brought three very similar operations together
this has allowed us the opportunity to begin looking at new ways to deliver our programs and services more effectively the departmental structure reflects four basic branch operations
these are 1 the directorate 2 community government 3 housing and 4 transportation the chart on page 7-1 of the main estimates document reflects the divisions within these four branches
i should note that the housing branch is also referred to as the nunavut housing corporation
it operates under the nunavut housing corporation act very similar to the nwt housing corporation
the nunavut housing corporation has its own budget which is made up of funding provided by the canada mortgage & housing corporation cmhc plus funding provided by the nunavut government
the corporation s budget will be finalized once the main estimates are approved
mr chairman and honourable members we face a major challenge in the area of social housing especially since cmhc is no longer providing the capital dollars to build new units
furthermore as the minister of finance indicated in his budget cmhc is also reducing annually the operations and maintenance o&m funding it transfers to us
we will need to work together as we attempt to deal with our social housing needs
we must look at new ways of doing things
we must seek out innovative ideas and solutions
i would like to have a review of existing programs to see if there are ways we could do things differently to be more effective and more efficient
i would like to look at some new ideas some new initiatives and some new partnerships
i invite the ideas and advice of the members of this assembly to assist me with this challenge
the mission statement of the department along with our current goals flow out of the business plan document
you can see in our goals that we want to develop open communication and consultation with our partners
we want to help communities enhance their capacities making it easier for local management and delivery of programs and services
we will also be enhancing community fire fighting training this is an effort to reduce our high fire loss record and stabilize fire insurance rates as the insurance industry has been expressing concern
we will also be much more proactive in prevention programs especially in the learn not to burn program offered through the schools
i have also asked my deputy to ensure that we enhance our search and rescue training and become more supportive to local authorities during local community search operations
the budget
the department s budget figures can be found in the main estimates document starting on page 7-3
the various pages in the main estimates break down the $97 287 million dollar o&m budget amount
as well they provide information on the $35 764 million dollar capital budget
you will note some large amounts in the main estimate document
for example on page 7-5 on the grants and contribution line is an amount of $26 465 million dollars
this includes hamlet contribution funding known as the municipal operating assistance program
it includes the water / sewer subsidy program funding equalization grants for the town grants in lieu of taxes and community development grants
you will also notice on page 7-12 under transportation on the other o&m line an amount of $12 323 million dollars
this amount may seem rather large but it includes all the funding which flows to communities under the airport operating contracts
these are necessary dollars to keep the airports in nunavut operational
on page 7-9 under housing on the capital contributions line is an amount of $19 060 million dollars
this represents the capital money provided by the government of nunavut to the nunavut housing corporation to assist in the delivery of a number of housing programs
as well the nunavut housing corporation receives $33 243 million dollars in operation and maintenance dollars
the housing corporation uses these dollars plus the $58 million dollars it receives from cmhc to develop its annual operating budget
as mentioned earlier once the departments main estimates are approved the housing corporation will finalize its budget
there have been concerns expressed that there was no consultation with communities as the framework budget was being developed and that was the case
the consultation was completed by the gnwt and the information was then filed with the former office of the interim commissioner oic as part of the transition planning process
a review of this information showed that the projects proposed far exceeded the limited resources that would be available to the nunavut government april 1/99
it was agreed that the following criteria would be used by departments to allocate capital in the transition year
contracts in place/funds already committedstatutory or regulatory requirementshealth and safety requirementsthird party funding in place/cost shared programs social housing which is one of our priorities
once these criteria were applied across all departments a capital budget was developed and that is what is now presented in the main estimate document
as the minister of finance said in his budget speech in the coming months we will be starting a 5-year capital planning program which will involve extensive consultation with mla s along with communities
i look forward to that process so that we can seek input from our communities so that we can develop the first nunavut five year capital plan
building a new government and starting a new fiscal year under new financial circumstances is not an easy task
i appreciate all the hard work of the mla s as we work together to get nunavut off to a strong start without deficit financing
i had wanted to make those points and mr chairman i would like to go up to the witness table at this time
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister for community government housing and transportation
you can go up to the witness table and also mr mike ferris and mr rafter
i apologize for not saying your names properly
you can go up to the witness table
we have mr mike ferris and mr rafter and we also have the minister of community government housing and transportation
welcome to our meeting
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman following are the comments after meetings that were held with the minister of community government housing and transportation
mr anawak appeared before the committee on the morning of april 28th 1999
the main estimate summary provided to the committee indicated total 1999/2000 expenditures of 133 million dollars of which 35 764 million is for capital spending
the committee was very impressed with the ministers presentation especially with respect to the comprehensive and detailed nature of the information provided
in reference to social housing the issue of social housing was the subject of extensive discussion during the ministers appearance
the minister identified a number of critical issues facing the department and the nunavut housing corporation with respect to social housing in nunavut
the minister advised that he would be shortly appointing a ministers committee to take a look at the issue of social housing
the standing committee was pleased to hear that the minister was open to ways of including regular members to the review process
the standing committee urges the department to undertake a broad review of housing issues in nunavut including the issue of facilitating home ownership
members of the committee raised a number of points related to the housing issue
among these were the difficulties facing families who want to get into the private housing market
disincentives for seasonal workers to seek jobs because of rent increases in social housing units the apparent unfairness of the mdapp monies being available to high income earners
the poor quality of workmanship of many of the southern contractors
the need for more energy efficient nunavut appropriate low cost housing units
another issue was the high cost/high mortgage rates for new homeowners and high heating and fuel costs
the minister indicated his desire for the department to review options and alternatives across the board
the minister also indicated that he was pressing his federal counterparts on this issue
the committee urges the minister to make every effort to pursue solutions to the housing crisis in nunavut and to maintain openness to innovative ideas and solutions
the committee recommends that a review of the dap program be undertaken and that the department consider raising the amounts of money available to 30 thousand dollars
the committee looks forward to working with the minister and other stakeholders in addressing this central issue to the wellbeing of nunavummiut
in reference to the iqaluit airport the committee was briefed on the serious impact that federal regulatory changes have had on the iqaluit airport and others in nunavut
these regulatory changes will impact such items as gravel airstrips and emergency response times
the committee is supportive of the minister in seeking additional resources from relevant federal bodies
in reference to the inuit employment plan
the minister indicated that the inuit employment plan for the department would be released shortly
the committee looks forward to the opportunity to reviewing this plan in detail
in reference to the legislative reform review the minister indicated that the review of departmental legislation has recently begun
the minister indicated that the department will begin consultations with the newly formed nunavut association of municipalities
the committee welcomed the invitation to make suggestions for the legislation changes
that is all the comments that i have mr chairman

general comments regarding community government
general comments
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
regarding community government
for many years i have been involved in community government and i have also been involved in community councils at that level
we have had difficulties with the territorial government that came about because there were cutbacks by the government
i think one of the things i would like to see in this department since community populations are increasing we need to have equitable capabilities in the communities for community services
for example most of the communities in my constituency are facing the same problems because the municipal services equipment are not keeping up with the community growth
since there has not been any increases in funding for those services that has caused some hardships in the communities
so i have been thinking that the funding provided to the communities should be on par with community growth and that funding formula should be changed to reflect that
thank you
chairperson interpretation
i thank you mr iqaqrialu if you wish to respond to that mr minister or
hon jack anawak interpretation
the funding that is provided to the communities is divided according to the population and what mr iqaqrialu has said is very true
communities are experiencing rapid growth and i think the census of these communities is behind
we will make due adjustments
sometimes funding is not enough even though you say you have this many people and they don t get per capita funding
we need to consider that in june we do not expect that all people will be there
thank you
chairperson interpretation thank you mr anawak
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i have a comment as well as a question
in regards to housing in the communities we are increasingly seeing problems in trying to get more social housing available in the communities
what is going to be happening in the future say in the next five years
i think the co-op can help you in this regard i think that you should be looking at things like the co-op to provide housing if there is going to be no forthcoming social housing
in my community the co-op purchased the past governments staff housing so there are some tenants in co-op houses now residing even though there are not many but i think that has eased the local housing authority somewhat
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes i agree with what mr alakannuark is saying that many of the problems can be worked out at the local level and when that can be done in a community
for example when all of the houses used to come from cmhc and the housing corporation even though there were people available who were able to build houses we always had to go by contracts
we didn t have anybody who could take on contracts at the local level but there are now co-ops and there are more people who are in the construction business who can look after these things
we are required by legislation to go by public tender and to contract whoever is more able to do the work
i would like to be clear that if there is a local company available to build houses or any kind of building and they have the capabilities they will be given the first opportunity to bid on a contract
we may be going against the land claims agreement which is administered by nti
i agree that if building can be done at the community level and local people can do it we support that
that money should be going to the community but if the reviewing committee is looking at that i will fully support working towards that goal
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
there is 46 million that is divided between the hamlets operations & maintenance
this 46 million dollars was arrived at by the gnwt from the 1980 census for o & m in community governments
for example in the year 2001 if there was a sudden change would this amount be changed to reflect the change in growth
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
you said 26 million 46 million
sorry i was looking for that figure of 46 million for operations
i can t see right now where we would get more money maybe if you clarify your question further i might be able to give you a better response
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
you said there was 35 million without the capital for community governments
the hamlet councils were trying to get more power for the communities so in the year 2001 if some program responsibilities were given over to the hamlet councils i think those funding levels would have to be increased
the figures that we are working on right now would have to be adjusted accordingly to what has been transferred to the communities
so if we are going to transfer responsibilities to the community governments then that figure that i was quoting would have to be increased
i think that was the commitment that the gnwt had made as more responsibilities are turned over to the communities there have to be funding increases as well
chairperson interpretation
yes mr nutarak you have made yourself clear
thank you
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
yes as i said before we want to look at housing needs in the communities
i know there is a nunavut association of municipalities now and i think that many of the communities may want to see some changes especially in terms of turning over responsibility for programs
if they are going to be administering programs for example for dpw the money that dpw would have used will be handed over to the hamlet council
or if a community wants to take over social programs which are normally under the responsibility of the government to administer then the funding will be provided for that to the hamlet council
the hamlets know what the needs are in the communities so we should as a government be looking for ways and means to accommodate the needs of the community and their priorities
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
i think your question has been answered mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i think i was the only one who wanted to talk about this issue
thank you for getting back to me so promptly
the hamlet council in the community is a municipal government in our community
the gnwt had a policy the municipal governments were non-profit organizations
if they are taking over more programs from the government it has to be made clear that the hamlet needs to know exactly what kind of organization they are going to be
are they for profit or not
i think that if they are going to be for profit they are going to take away from potential business growth in a community by taxing them
i think we have to keep the hamlet councils as non-profit organizations and this needs to be clarified before hamlet councils are given more responsibilities that government presently provides
the private businesses are for profit per se we need to clarify exactly what the hamlet councils can do so that they do not take away from the local residents what could be a for profit businesses
for that reason to me that is very important
so i think that we need to make very clear policies about transferring government programs to the hamlets before full community empowerment goes ahead
i know that it may be a good thing but i just wanted to clarify this before we got too far in the discussions about this department
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr anawak would you like to make a comment on that
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
yes his comments were very clear i can even make an example that in some communities they have heavy equipment either to remove snow or to work on the roads
sometimes private businesses don t have anything to do because the hamlet councils are responsible for clearing up the roads
in order to support the communities more when there are other people outside of the hamlet council that can actually work we would like to utilize them and help them out
in regards to the hamlet councils and co-ops i just used those as an example
for example perhaps it would be cheaper if we could work for one year with the help of the hamlet council because they do have heavy equipment to work on gravel
once we get more people in private business we could utilize those private businesses whether it be snow removal or gravel equipment if private businesses have equipment such as these we would utilize them
right now we have not had a chance to review this or what the needs are in the communities or what there is in the communities
perhaps we have not been asking questions of the communities because we are quite new
i will be requiring the support of the regular members and the communities as well as the association of municipalities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i am going to be talking about something totally different from previously
i just want you to know that the housing associations were used by gnwt to find out how many people were living in one unit
the funding that was allotted to the housing association never even considered the people
for example in the smaller communities like clyde river the budget was much larger than in the larger communities
i could ask this under written questions but we have to review all of these issues when we are dealing with social housing because social housing has caused many challenges and hardships for people in the communities
some units only have two people living in the unit and the price the rent is the same whether you are overcrowded or not
we don t view these people in the communities so this tends to bring up some social problems in the community in my opinion
i just wanted to point this out further
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
i am going to use myself as an example
i think we are going to have to be aware that for those people that cannot afford to buy their own home they cannot get housing for a long time
i haven t lived in a smaller community for a long time so at times i feel i know the communities but i realize that the communities know their needs best
therefore i feel that the communities would know what their needs are best so we should be consulting with the communities with the renters and with the people in the communities to find a better solution
i have lived in repulse bay a smaller community and i know that sometimes when you have a problem just because the community doesn t know how to resolve a problem it is solved by the government
the government hasn t known the community needs in the past so therefore they would resolve the problem for them when it could have been resolved locally
for that reason i will require support from the members and the public out there in order to utilize the funds
i understand mr iqaqrialu s comment too and i also want to point out that i do feel that i know the communities but it has been quite a while since i have lived in a smaller community
these smaller communities are the best people to know what their requirements are along with the public
with the support of the house and the members of the public i am sure we can develop this program in the upcoming years
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr iqaqrialu i think he responded to your question adequately
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
mr chairperson if there are other people who would like to speak i could stay quiet for a while so that i can give more opportunity to others
thank you
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
thank you david
i know how i felt when i was asking lots of questions
that s okay david that s what we re here for
mr chairman i would like to just read over first a goal in the main estimates of the department which is to establish the department through the successful integration of community government housing & transportation functions
in his opening remarks the minister talked about this amalgamation which would allow them an opportunity to look at new ways to deliver programs and services more effectively
i am wondering mr chairman if the minister could provide us with some insight as to how this is being accomplished to date
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
i would just like to mention a couple of things first
we will be working on it as soon as possible in order to better have an idea of what kind of programs we need to deliver what better ways there are out there
but in terms of the better delivery of services within the department i wonder if i might ask the deputy minister to briefly outline the amalgamation of the department
chairperson
mr ferris
mr ferris deputy minister community government housing & transportation
thank you mr chairperson
the amalgamation is proceeding we are still in the process of rolling together at the regional level the staff that we inherited from the government of the northwest territories
it s obviously a little bit easier to structure your headquarters when you are putting new positions in place
what we are attempting to do in the amalgamation and we ll be attempting to do further in consultation with the communities and our partners is draw on the strengths of the three departments that we are amalgamating into one
there s very good things that municipal & community affairs was doing there are very good things that the housing corporation was doing and the same with transportation
for example housing was looking at financial records of the local housing authority there is no reason why that same person can t provide assistance to the hamlet council on the hamlet side of the books
so we are looking at in the amalgamation to draw on those strengths to build a department that we can take and come up with some efficiencies in the delivery
so there will be one branch of our headquarters that will have some specialized people in it and they will be concentrating on the housing issues in the broader scale because they are at headquarters
at the regional level the headquarters although some of the staff would have reporting links to the housing corporation they will be delivering a united service
but there will be the same in transportation we have at least three or four positions that we have to maintain to ensure that we keep certification on airports
so they are special but where we can amalgamate and reduce the numbers and yet deliver more programs efficiently that s what we are looking at
we will be involving as we did through the nunavut consultation conferences start more consultation with the communities and with our partners on those levels of service
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ferris
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i am just looking at 7 1 in the mains and it shows three distinct separate divisions of community government housing & transportation
i am wondering if the organizational structure and the chart is going to be changing in light of looking at amalgamating these services in the future
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
either one of you can respond
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
chairperson
mr ferris
mr ferris
thank you mr chairperson
just to add one further comment when we appeared before the standing committee we were given some advice about a report that did exist on the old housing corporation
we have secured a copy of that report and are looking at it
as the minister said then and again now there could be some change in the organizational structure
we are working with the original structure that grew out of footprints ii and as we put the team together we may for example consumer affairs may fit somewhere better other than the nunavut housing corporation
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes as i have stated earlier on that housing is one of the critical departments and one of the most challenging departments and community government is one of the important issues for the communities
if we are going to be changing the contents in order to benefit the communities we will require the assistance and support of the regular members
if we plan to make changes we will notify you ahead of time and we will be asking you well in advance as to your feelings on any issue if we want to make changes
if we are going to develop the nunavut government we are going to be requiring your assistance and we will ask you for your support
not just on documents if we are going to be making changes or making amendments if we want to make changes to what was inherited from the gnwt yes we will require your assistance
thank you
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson

again we will be starting the process
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i would like my name to be pronounced right it is not irqittuq it is irqittuq mr chairman thank you
i would like to be represented and addressed properly
in the ministers department under 5 3 when you open the page to 5 6 the capital from 99/2000 what is in the capital
i think you have stated that you would like to work with the hamlet councils so that you can set up the capital plans
did i understand you correctly
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr irqittuq we are not dealing with the department of justice we are dealing with community government housing & transportation
mr irqittuq interpretation
mr chairman i never mentioned the justice department i was talking about the main estimates for capital plan
i am talking about the capital plan i am not in the justice department
chairperson interpretation
when you said 5 3 i open the page and it says department of justice
mr irqittuq interpretation
i didn t say 5 7 i said 7 3
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
well i heard 5 3 too
>>laughter
we also want to come to an agreement with the communities when we are talking about capital projects in their communities
chairperson
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i apologize i did say 5 3 when i was trying to talk about 7 3
thank you mr chairperson in 7 3 we have contributions and on this page are these contributions set for a specific purpose
chairperson interpretation
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i didn t realize that the details were here
i misunderstood the inuktitut term that was used to explain the operations maintenance capital and so on
i asked the minister of education and the response i got was if a contract was signed already or if it was a health and safety issue they would go ahead with that capital project
you probably won t be able to answer my question but if a plan for a house or if a plan was already drawn on a house or a facility that would mean that the project is already under way
does that mean that it has to go ahead this year
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
i think i understand your question
if it is already using money then of course we have to pay for the blueprints and the plans and so on specifications
i think you are talking about the grants & contributions here which is 59 million here
we have to specify what these grants & contributions are going to be used for before they are given to the community
chairperson
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i understand exactly what you are saying so i will be able to give more money to mr arvaluk
my other comment is the hamlets and the housing authorities
in my constituency you stated that you would like to support the communities that would like to build private homes
of course we all want to help those communities but the hamlets and the housing authorities never seem to be able to get these projects going
i am not going to say a specific name but this person owns a private business in igloolik maintaining furnaces
there are about 1200 people in igloolik and this person is the only oil burner mechanic in the whole town
we do want to see private businesses flourish in the communities and if there is a private oil burner mechanic in the community i hope that by next year we use these private businesses private tradespeople
they are going to social services because they are not being utilized because they can t make any money
they have journeyman certificates tickets and everything but they can t get anywhere
i like where you are coming from and if there is a private business person or journeyman ticketed in the community then use these people
we keep saying that there s article 24 that we have to use as a nunavut government
we have to use article 24 because we were created because of the agreement
chairperson
mr minister
hon jack anawak interpretation
i believe you are talking about housing associations who have their own staff their own oil burner mechanics on staff
if the rcmp need an oil burner mechanic they use the one that is on the staff of the housing association
we can look into this further it is not only oil burner mechanics it is also carpenters who could be contracted by the rcmp the co-ops and so on
i was just using this as an example for example if there is no contractor in the community
chairperson
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you for that explanation mr minister
for those business people who are just starting out if they have registration and a business license they are business people no matter what trade or business they are in
with all these barriers a person who is very capable of starting a business but does not have the cash flow is incapable of bidding on these contracts
they might go to economic development because they don t have the requirements they cannot get started
even with nunavut government and the agreement and so on we are still setting up those barriers for people who want to start their own businesses
so we have to look at ways and means of how it could be easier for the people of nunavut if we are talking about keeping the money in nunavut
chairperson
mr minister
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes i understand exactly where you are coming from
i think it was last year in the fall where we ran into some problems
i believe it was a water reservoir in coral harbour that was going to be built
the community was very capable they had all the heavy equipment they had the personnel they had the lowest bid i believe but since they couldn t get a bid bond the contract was awarded to a company in yellowknife
so we have to look into this further and yes they did get the work but they should have been the one to have been awarded that contract so more money would have stayed in the community
i am well aware of these problems and i do see the need to review it so the communities can prosper
i know exactly where you are coming from
chairperson interpretation
thank you
since our clock is ticking and we do have names on the list there is mr mclean mr akesuk and mr tootoo
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairman
these are just general comments from myself and i don t really require an answer
going through community government i think we got 1% of the allocation in the keewatin
housing we got 0% allocation in the keewatin this is baker lake i m talking about
in transportation 0% of the allocation for the keewatin
like i say i know it is not the honourable inaudible comment but being on the hamlet council in baker lake for the last number of years there should be more movement
i see from the footprints ll document that there are no adm s in the footprints ll document and i see three of them here
i am hoping that the minister has a detailed work plan in place for his assistant deputy ministers to travel around and take some workload off of the very capable deputy minister
i think we will agree that we should see the adm s more in our communities all over nunavut
but like i say these are just general comments
the housing part of this and i was phoned by a few people and public works and services are doing all of the technical work
to me that i don t think that is a very good idea
i know that it has been set up that way and i am sure public works and housing had really no say in it before you got it but i think it is something that should be looked at
you have public works doing the technical work and housing corporation delivering the program and the work
i can see conflicts there
if the technical people were with the housing corporation i think in my opinion dealing with the housing corporation as a hamlet councillor and as a businessman that the housing corporation should have their own technical people
it worked in the past
i don t want to go back to the old government thing
another item a transportation strategy
are we even looking at developing a transportation strategy in regards to nunavut
i know we had a transportation strategy that reflected the old west and they were to build highways build highways build highways
i didn t see us really over here developing a core transportation strategy that reflected all the communities from the middle to the larger ones
navcanada fees
i beat that one up pretty bad when i could with the business community
we do and all of a sudden we get hit with we are penalized because of our isolation with navcanada fees
we know that it is a not for profit organization
so when their costs increase costs increase to the consumers
it really helped by bring down the price of apples and oranges and bread and eggs and stuff like that
i think navcanada adds three to five to seven percent on to the cost of commercial items
it is just my general comments
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
before a response from the minister we made a motion that we have to adjourn at six o clock it is now getting on to six o clock
i would like to ask the committee what their wishes
do you want to go ahead

gjoa haven gasoline situation
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as a result of the issues that have been raised with respect to the gjoa haven gasoline i would like to provide the following facts for the information of all those concerned
sampling and testing of gasoline diesel and aircraft fuels is completed before the products are shipped to the community
the gjoa haven cambridge bay and taloyoak gasoline passed tests for these specifications
after the tanks were filled in the community another set of samples were taken and tested
these also met the specifications
in response to the concerns raised by the community additional samples were taken and tested
one set of these samples was sent to an independent testing facility as requested by the hamlet
a copy of the results of these tests was sent directly to the hamlet by the testing facility
analysis of all these samples was completed by three separate facilities
alberta research council petro-canada and advanced engine technologies ltd
advanced engine technologies is also inspecting the damaged engine parts
in addition they are conducting cold weather testing
a preliminary report is expected this week and a final report should be ready in early june
the department has incurred total costs of $39 300 in an attempt to address the concerns of gjoa haven residents about the gasoline
i would also like to emphasize that this is the same gasoline that is being used in both cambridge bay and taloyoak
it is from the same shipment
i am happy to report that recently there was a fishing derby in gjoa haven and there were no major snowmobile problems reported
i also note that there was recent mention of snowmobile races that were held in the community
again no problems were reported
mr speaker i hope that this will help reassure the residents of gjoa haven that we take their concerns seriously and we have been attempting to use all the resources at our disposal in order to satisfy those concerns
thank you mr speaker

nunavut / kivalliq road link
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to take this time today to comment on the premiers statements on the road link to kivalliq and nunavut
we hear costs but to every project there is a cost but this project the payback to all of nunavut will be huge
we are dealing with federal transfer payments and we are all saying that we need more money for housing education and health
a road to the kivalliq opens up both the tourism sector and the non-renewable resource sector
this means jobs in tourism and mining
jobs mean taxes both personal and corporate
it also means royalties
this means we as residents of nunavut are starting to stand on our own two feet by generating much needed revenue that nunavut needs to run programs
mr speaker a road to the kivalliq region brings benefits to all members of nunavut

oral questions
question 84 - 1 2
status of doctor for igloolik
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yesterday i asked a question to the minister of health and the response i got was inaccurate
the question i brought was regarding doctors
when we were in igloolik the minister made a statement saying there was going to be a doctor based in igloolik as soon as accommodations were available and he stated that name of a particular doctor
mr speaker when i asked him what the status was apparently he misunderstood my question
so my question now is what is the status of the doctor now
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker in the translation yesterday it came across as the nurse in igloolik and not the doctor
in the original question when i reviewed it just now indeed the translation was lost so i think we have to get our hansard fixed
the intention of the doctor was to move to igloolik
when i came back from igloolik i contacted the health board through the department to find out the status of the doctor moving to igloolik was and is
to date i still haven t got an official response from the health board on the status of the doctor when the doctor was moving to igloolik and on the housing situation
thank you mr speaker

thank you mr speaker
i will be asking my question to the minister responsible for ntpc
i have not yet received any documents regarding the ntpc
i am not asking for all the documents i just want the documents specific to clyde river

i just want the report specifically for clyde river

minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker yes i have had a couple of conversations with the member on the power corporation
as most members realize the northwest territories power corporation actually has two ministers
the minister for the northwest territories is mr dent and i am responsible for operational issues here in the nunavut region
after saying that the information on the clyde river plant i requested that information from the power corporation which is at their head office in hay river
i spoke to my staff about it this morning and i haven t got that information right now but will commit to getting that information to the member today
thank you mr speaker
speaker

oral questions
mr nutarak
question 86 - 1 2
tunnel between schools in pond inlet
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this question is for the minister of education
we have two schools one older than the other
they re looking a putting a tunnel or connector between the two schools
one doesn t have a gym so the idea behind putting in this tunnel was so that the students could go over there during school without going outside
i have received correspondence from the gnwt
one was built in 1961 and we have a problem with the schools i would like the minister of education to give me an update on what is happening with these two schools
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes i did get that letter from the baffin divisional board of education mr david qamaniq from pond inlet
i think the member is well aware that we did have the safety officer check out the school
i think it was during the gnwt days that the minister of education charles dent realised that following the safety code they couldn t build this tunnel
even if this was put into the 99/2000 budget we can t go ahead because it is a fire hazard to put the tunnel from the old school to the new school
there is a new set of codes that we have to follow with newer facilities and the safety officers are concerned that should there be a fire in any one of these facilities it could become a safety concern
if the older facility caught on fire it could become a safety concern for the students
with that in mind we still haven t done anything about the tunnel between the two schools
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
second question mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
although i didn t hear a question in there mr minister you can respond
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
according to what i hear him saying i think he is asking us to rectify the situation
at this time we are trying to accumulate all the information on the pond inlet school
i have my staff working on this issue and i also want to hear from the government staff and others who usually deal with building standards and codes
i will instruct them to discuss this matter with the education council in pond inlet and also work with the capital estimates within the department of education
we will deal with the issue tonight
we are all aware of what the members concern is mr speaker that one of the schools has a gymnasium and the other does not
for that reason how we will we be able to rectify this problem according to building standards and looking at the children catching colds from leaving the gymnasium to go back to their classrooms
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
third question mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
as the education minister stated he had asked the fire marshall to investigate the school although he met with the council they couldn t come up with a concrete solution
last week we started working on this issue and the fire marshall was unable to respond to our questions
so perhaps if the minister could go to pond inlet and meet with the council they could rectify this situation in pond inlet
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
i don t know if there was a question in his comments
mr speaker i know they couldn t come to an agreement when the government staff members and the community education council hamlet council or housing council met
when the government officials cannot agree with the entities in the communities they usually ask their superiors what they should do
i am sure they will be asking me that question sometime in the future so i will also consider this and i am sure i will also be given different options to solve the situation
i think we will have to deal with the options first and after that respond to the member as to whether i have to go to pond inlet to meet with the education council
thank you
speaker interpretation

question 87 - 1 2
pipeline to water reservoir
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the minister of public works telecommunications & technical services
i went to my home community over the weekend and a concern was raised in regards to the pipeline going to the water reservoir
it goes all the way up to the lake and this pipeline is pretty old
the health officials have already investigated the pipeline for safety reasons when gnwt was our government
my question is do you have any money available to deal with the old pipeline
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
minister of public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am aware of the community s concern over this issue and i will look into it and see what we can do and reply to you when we find out
speaker
thank you ms thompson
second question mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the health inspectors were in cape dorset for a while and they stated that we could only use that pipeline for up to one more year
once the pipeline breaks or if it erodes or gets damaged we would have to deal with this as an emergency issue
i was wondering ms thompson if you could look into this as soon as possible
thank you
speaker
thank you mr akesuk
minister of public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes i will get my officials to work on the pipeline as soon as possible
i know that the community is quite concerned about it
we will also look into the reports that were written after the investigation and i will direct my officials to look into that
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson

question 88 - 1 2
gun control legislation
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the premier
perhaps a majority of the nunavut residents are concerned about gun control legislation
i would just like further clarification on your response what the status is mr premier
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation

i would have to respond the same we are still looking into this and we re looking into the legal aspects of this

question 89 - 1 2
policy for establishing full time doctors in nunavut communities
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the minister of health
mr speaker i want to know what the policy is regarding establishing full time doctors in nunavut communities
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
on the positioning of doctors in communities as the minister it is my aim to try and get as many doctors into communities as possible
we are going to try and do that over the next year as we phase out the boards and take on that responsibility
at the present time the staffing of doctors individual doctors is at the request of the individual health board we then try to facilitate that arrangement
again it is based on the demand at the community level and the availability of doctors to make that move
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i think the minister has answered my question in regards to establishing a doctor in baker lake we have made many requests to the keewatin regional health board and the request has fallen on deaf ears
is the minister when we abolish the health boards going to make a commitment to establishing full time doctors in communities that qualify for them
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i can commit to looking into it mr speaker
as i said it depends on the availability of doctors and i guess what we would be looking for in the communities would be a general practitioner
right now as we all know there are demand problems supply problems with medical professionals not only in nunavut but all over canada and indeed in north america
that is one of the things we are trying to do in the department of health
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions
mr tootoo
question 90 - 1 2
gun control legislation
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question goes to the premier
as my colleague from hudson bay indicated he had asked about any action being taken on gun control legislation with ottawa
last week i believe i posed a question to the minister of justice and if his department was going to be taking a look at it
in light of this mr premier i would like to ask if the government is taking a look at the possibility of approaching ottawa on it and if so whose department is going to be responsible for it
is it going to be through executive or is it going to be through justice
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr premier
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
southern governments are involved in this court action
my department will be handling the situation and we will use some expertise at the department of justice as there are legal matters
from what i understand there is no court hearing set as of yet at the supreme court of canada level
we are monitoring the situation and we will continue to do so and see what we can do for nunavut
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr okalik
second question mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
not whether we are waiting to hear if we are going to court or not
i am just wondering if any talks have proceeded in that area
just setting up a dialogue with the federal government to look at possible changes
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
government leader mr okalik
hon paul okalik
i believe the reason why they are in court is that attempts were made to try and modify the legislation and they wouldn t be in court if they hadn t tried that
i could look into it and get back to the member
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr premier
oral questions
mr puqiqnak
question 91 - 1 2
impact of proposed highway on taloyoak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the minister responsible for transportation
as the qamanittuaq member had stated he made a members statement that he is happy about constructing a road in the keewatin region
everybody is quite happy and pleased about the proposal
my question on behalf of kitikmeot and taloyoak is will it have a social impact on the community of taloyoak or will it also benefit the community of taloyoak
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
minister of transportation mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
in regards to transportation on behalf of our department i would like to thank the premier for discussing this matter at the western premier s conference but this is only a part of transportation s responsibilities in the keewatin region
we have to find ways to solve the transportation issues
at this time we don t know if this construction will actually go ahead but if it does go ahead in the future it will alleviate many of the high costs of living in the communities in nunavut
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
second question mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
they tend to get stuck in our area so that is why i asked this question
perhaps we can get the cargo ships to come earlier to my communities because they arrive pretty late in the season
when they arrive late with the construction materials we have to build the units pretty late in the fall
sometimes we have to wait until the next spring to construct our units because materials have arrived too late in the fall so we have to wait another year to get the construction going
if the ships came earlier in the fall we could start the construction earlier
thank you
speaker interpretation
please try to keep your questions brief
if you are going to use examples try to keep them brief so you don t repeat your questions and are brief
minister mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes thank you
we have to look at transportation issues in all aspects whether it be aircraft ships or constructing roads
we have to look at transportation as a whole
we have to look at everything we have to look at all aspects of transportation when dealing with this issue and we will keep updating you as we progress
thank you
speaker
thank you mr anawak
third question mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
today is 1999 and we still haven t started dealing with it this year
i remember in 1993 at the leaders summit there was a motion raised to have the cargo ships come earlier in the fall
i started working on this issue back in 1993
we had requested an earlier arrival for the ships especially in the two communities that i have mentioned
i was told that i would have to make a request to god and pray that the ice would melt a lot sooner than it actually did
however this is not a joke i was asked that question
for that reason mr speaker if this is not going to change if cargo shipments still arrive late in the season if this doesn t change it will not resolve anything unless the season starts warming up a lot earlier
if the department is going to be constructing a road it will be a lot easier for the two communities
if they are not going to be constructing a road perhaps they should be extending the airstrips in the two communities
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
i know there are other members who would like to ask questions so if you could use shorter examples so that the other members could have an opportunity to ask questions
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
i can tell my colleague that ntcl creates the schedule and we will speak to them in respect of the sealift schedule
the other matters which he raised we will be looking at them
it has to follow the codes and so on i will ask my staff to look into that a little more
i think it has to be kept in mind that there are safety hazards as well and we have to look at everything before we deal with those matters
thank you
speaker
thank you mr anawak

mr o brien
question 92 - 1 2
proposed power grid to keewatin
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it is nice to hear the road from the south to the keewatin or nunavut get so much profile
but there is another issue that is being reviewed and studied and that is the power grid from churchill to arviat and the keewatin in general
i wonder if the minister could update the house on the status of the study that has been ongoing for the last two years in reference to costs and routing and so on of this proposed power grid
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i am aware of the proposal on the power grid mr o brien has been very articulate over the past couple of years in his support for the power grid
i haven t actually read the study but i can commit to the member to get that information and provide it to him
the power corporation we don t have a nunavut power corporation as such mr speaker indeed it is still the northwest territories power corporation
we have a transition agreement in place which allows for both governments to look at the feasibility of nunavut going it alone or look at shared resources the status quo keeping the power corporation
that is just for the information of the house
so i will commit to update the member in this house on the proposed power grid line or corridor between the province of manitoba and the keewatin region of nunavut
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral question mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker would the minister also commit to getting information on the potential cost savings i believe the kilowatt hour cost in manitoba is something like six cents and in my community it is about sixty

question 93 - 1 2
airline schedules in the kitikmeot
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question which i will be posing is to be directed to the minister of transportation
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
yes thank you mr speaker
that is all i can say right now as i still haven t met with the airline companies
regarding his question on the airline schedules they have looked at that option but they still have not implemented it and i am not sure how they are going to implement it until i have met with them
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
oral questions
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i understand the ministers statement but every time i try to go to repulse bay it is impossible without re-routing through somewhere
i have to go through yellowknife in order to get to repulse and it is very expensive to take that route
we have been trying to get this changed and the kitikmeot leaders have been trying to get this changed since 1988 to try and get a scheduled route to repulse pelly bay and igloolik
although this issue has been ongoing the mayor of repulse bay and myself i think my question is more towards how the schedule can be changed to benefit the people of pelly bay and the keewatin
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
minister of transportation mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
i know that the airline companies are aware of the changes in nunavut and the schedules will be changed
for example the people from kitikmeot no matter which community they come from whether it be cambridge taloyoak gjoa haven wherever they have to go through yellowknife
as nunavut is getting implemented and as we are getting used to our new government i know that there will be better transportation links between the larger centres and more travel between the regions
speaker interpretation
thank you
oral question
mr kattuk
question 94 - 1 2
socio-economic impact of highway construction
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct this question to the minister of transportation
it changes their lives and i know there has been loss of life because when they were travelling down that route they had accidents
i know it has been a concern raised especially by the cree and the other indian tribes once they got a road from the south they have said that a lot of their band members dies
so i guess i am asking the minister if they are to construct a highway from the south whether they have looked into the matter of socio-economic impacts of the proposed highway
that is my question to the minister of transportation
thank you mr speaker

court challenge to gun control legislation

mr speaker i have been pondering the answer the premier gave me in response to my last question and i have another question in regards to the same issue
earlier he indicated that they are waiting to see the outcome of the legal challenge that is being put forward by the other jurisdictions in canada
i am wondering mr speaker are we just going to sit and wait to see what happens with that
or are we going to file in order to participate and to have our concerns heard there
are we going to be observers or are we going to be participants in that

mr irqittuq
question 96 - 1 2 court challenge to gun control legislation
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in respect to the premier
he has been given the same question but i would like to ask the same question on the same issue and when ever we have a question sometimes we get one standard answer when we are reviewing the issue
i know mr speaker i can review this and i am reviewing this as i speak
and that s the usual answer
how i guess my question is in respect to the gun legislation how much what has he done not just a review
where are the letters that have been written or what are the issues that are dealt with
i think that these are the types of things we are asking questions about
speaker interpretation
thank you two questions
mr premier

oral questions mr o brien
question 98 - 1 2 health/education board amalgamation contract
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker yesterday i posed some questions in reference to a contract that was issued to hire an individual to review i guess some and provide transitional details regarding the health board and education board
the minister of health indicated that the contract was being looked after by the premier s office and the department of intergovernmental affairs
i wonder if the premier the premier if he doesn t have his information today if he would commit to provide the terms of reference for this arrangement
i searched through the hansard and i see it is being called that the individual is hired and i see other areas where it is a contract a short term contract and so on
my question would be would the premier commit to providing this house with the terms of reference for this arrangement and also the time lines
thank you
speaker
before you answer i would like to address something
yesterday there was a question made to mr picco regarding this contract and the name was mentioned
we do not mention names in here in the house when the person cannot defend himself i would like to address that
question was directed to mr premier
mr okalik
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
i believe that this issue is being looked at at the justice department whether we can actually file terms of reference for actual contracts before the house
thank you mr speaker and i will get back to the member as soon as that determination is decided

mr nutarak interpretation

that was that project was to have started in 1997 and more work to be done in 1998 with a break in between

oral questions
mr tootoo
question 100 - 1 2
government contracts made public
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question has come about as a result of a comment made by the premier so i would like to ask him
he indicated that they wanted to find out whether they could provide contracts public contracts with government dollars that information to members of this house
mr speaker i guess that leaves me asking the question
is this if they say it is not does this government have the ability to enter into contracts with people or companies without having that knowledge being made public

mr speaker most employees of the government are hired through the department of human resources
i would think all of them should be

speaker
thank you mr tootoo
i hear no question but if you want to respond mr premier

thank you mr speaker
speaker

third question mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker in these contracts i know the government employees fall under the government contracts and are treated in a certain way

oral questions
mr iqaqrialu
question 101 - 1 2 insurance for hunters
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker i have two questions
first one is to the minister of sustainable development
in my community there is quite a lot of whales outside of our community
in the summer it is quite dangerous because of the large population of whales
should there be an accident what would happen if a boat was capsized by a bowhead
for example what kind of insurance or what kind of plan is there
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
english minister of sustainable development mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to respond first of all for example outfitters are insured under the tourism policy and there are the regular hunters who are covered or could make a request to the workers compensation board
those are two types of insurance that could be taken through the nunavut government and if he would like further information he can ask us another question
speaker
thank you mr kilabuk
second question mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
thank you for that direct response
i have another question regarding people from clyde river we have a high density of polar bear population in that area
i am always opposed to the polar bear guidelines or guidelines where we are told that we can only hunt male polar bears which is totally opposite of the way i was brought up and the way i am
now that there are too many young bears there is a lot of dangerous bears out there now and there is a large population of young bears
can we make amendments to the present regulations so that we could alleviate this problem through the nunavut government
speaker interpretation
thank you for your question
i will not about his question you should have asked the same you started off by asking a question about bowheads
you should have kept to that subject
question period is over mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation

we will deal with the matters that we did not complete yesterday with community government housing & transportation with minister anawak at the witness table

hon jack anawak interpretation
mr chairman the deputy minister is on his way
he is just trying to park his vehicle
the officials that were here yesterday with me will be the same people at the witness table
chairperson interpretation

we reported progress yesterday at 6 o clock
so we will just continue with the ministers department of community government housing & transportation
i will ask for general comments at this time before he starts with the main estimates
minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes at this time we are just waiting for our officials and the deputy minister is here now
chairperson interpretation
are there any other general comments from the members
we will just continue on from yesterday so you may ask your questions
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman yesterday i took a look at one of the goals for the department
having looked them over i saw another one there that i would like to ask the minister about
the goal of the department is to improve client satisfaction improve the monitoring and evaluation of community government performance
mr chairman i would like to ask the minister and his staff if he can elaborate exactly how they look at doing that or achieving that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister anawak hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you the community governments the hamlet councils have to operate within themselves independently from the other communities
as a government we have to watch and monitor them to see if they are operating within their responsibilities
some municipalities a majority of the communities are operating smoothly but some of the communities have debts
once we start realizing that a community requires assistance we will try and assist them ahead of time so that they will alleviate most of the problems encountered
we did not go into detail as to how we can give them further support and how we can monitor the communities
we want to improve the monitoring and evaluation of community government performance because if the communities govern themselves they can develop themselves and build capacity to ensure that the communities are prepared
however we all come from different communities
members come from different communities
we will keep updating you on the new issues coming up
thank you mr minister
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
pointing out some of the things on how it s been and things that they like to do but again mr chairman i ve ask the minister and staff how they plan on doing that
it s all fine to say we want to do this we want to improve this i m just wondering if there s any mechanisms or preliminary plans for the actual implementations to achieve this goal
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
we are just developing those and all i can say is that we will improve
chairperson
interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
they don t really have any concrete plans in how they re going to achieve this goal in dealing with finances and monitoring evaluating performance
could the minister or his staff provide us with the time frame as to when they plan on having such policies in place
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
interpretation
mr anawak if you wish to answer this or your officials may respond to that
hon jack anawak
interpretation
yes mr chairman we have not developed anything
we have just started and again even if we were to develop anything w e would involve members and the communities
if we were to unilaterally make a policy we would not meet the needs in the community we want to involve the communities and the members
my deputy minister will respond
chairperson
interpretation
deputy minister mike ferris you may proceed
mr ferris
thank you mr chairman
one other thing that we are exploring is using the new electronic highway but we need to have discussions with our partners in the communities
the justice minister indicated that we re just a bit early in the process but it was important enough to put it as a goal and we ve got the sub task that we ve got people now looking at
chairperson
qujannamiik
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
the minister indicated that they want to consult with the communities in regards to concerns and issues
i believe in december there was a conference here sponsored by the department to hear those concerns and stuff
i m just wondering has any of that information been utilized to date in developing policies law along these lines and address the issues that the communities expressed at that time
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
interpretation
yes regarding those concerns or issues there has already been discussions on the issues raised by the communities
we have written to the communities and we will keep these in mind
in respect to some of the issues when the conference was held in december there was still no nunavut government and they raised their concerns issues and their priorities
we knew there would be concerns or problems raised and that s why i m bringing it up now
we wish to consult them but in respect to the conference that was held in december and the report the report has have been sent to every community
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess i m just wondering you know is there a need to go back and consult was not done during the conference
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
i ve lived in a small community and i do not consider one meeting to be consultation enough from the government however i can tell you about two measures that we ve already started dealing with
the first one is we are going back to quarterly funding for the communities
that was a recommendation by the conference
the other one a single time zone for nunavut that were working on now
chairperson
interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr tootoo you may ask more questions however there are other members so keep that in mind so i will ask you to ask your last question mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i believe as elected members we re able to ask as many questions because were not limited by the time frame or any thing like that i will stop after the other members ask
is that correct
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
interpretation
before you answer mr anawak mr tootoo you asked earlier i know you have more questions after the other members i know you can return to that issue
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
chairperson
interpretation
thank you
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes yesterday i believe mike stated something yesterday on the visitations made either from the headquarters or the regional offices
when he goes to help the communities or when he goes to consult with the communities we can use that suggestion mr chairman
chairperson
interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
there s three different things if we were to look at these main estimates those are very different from what my community wanted or what they had as their priorities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
interpretation
thank you
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
i would like to look at how we do the capital planning program i think there are still some difficulties in it so we need to improve it
the communities and ourselves we ve got to get together and deal with these kind of issues properly with the communities involvement perhaps because they are expecting to get something when they make the 5 year capital plan
when they submit it to the government it usually returns as a completely different capital plan because they don t work together at the same time
in respect to the five year capital plan exercise perhaps if we were involved either our staff or if we were involved to some extent the capital planning exercise for communities would be better in that way
i recognize that problem and when we have finish these issues we will speak to the community capital plans and i think we can meet with the communities as to how we can better plan for this year
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr iqaqrialu do you have further questions or comments
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i really cannot try and challenge them because he states what i want to hear and i hear the proper comments and i ve been dealing with this issue ever since
i know that seems to be the goal but if we are going to have a 5 year capital plan i think that exercise is good but i think it should be done that way
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
i really think that was more of a comment therefore when there s no question i want to make a short statement again
all of us members of the house and also our ministers who are from nunavut and from our communities our constituents are expecting that we were expecting a proper policy
i know we want to see that as soon as possible but again the nunavut government is very new and it s still in infancy and we know were tired of waiting
even the ministers and i know all the members and our constituents i know expecting a lot of good things in order to make the government proceed smoothly
we know in the future that were keeping the future in mind and what journey will end up i think we have a clear goal
i know that some people are getting impatient but were expecting this government in this day and age will be closer to the communities and the people there are some people who have raised their hands
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
david probably mentioned a portion of my question that i was going to ask regarding the municipalities in the nunavut area and them being more involved but i think that the communities weren t consulted enough
i think that it would be better working relationship between the two so that was my question mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
hon jack anawak interpretation
people s expectations are raised and then they are given a lot less then they thought they were going to be getting
so i think that it s best if there s a closer working relationship between the two governments than things would be able to go forward
sometimes we just argue about the things that are taken out of the capital plan and if they were well informed we won t unnecessarily have to go through that debate
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr akesuk
mr akesuk
i hear that in the keewatin they tried in the communities to have the mayors set up the capital plan or set up the block funding to be given to the mayor
my question is would you consider giving block funding to the baffin so that the municipalities could look through it and see what would fit in to their communities
do you have any such plans in the future thank you mr chairman
hon jack anawak interpretation
we re looking at means to make improvements on how we deal with the governments and how we can work closer together with the municipalities
chairperson
for those members who have comments or questions
mr mclean your name is next on the list
mr mclean
thank you mr chairman
in regards to i ll be all over the place here
in regards to the mdap program where people are eligible from 5% - 7% of the purchase price of a house
my community as an example i have heard a lot of potential homeowners and people that purchased houses and the total inequity of the system
it even went so far that people who do qualify for the 70% their spouses whether it is him or her may take time off so they can qualify for that extra grant
i have heard stories i don t know if they are true or not that people are getting 120 thousand dollars for the purchase price of a house
nowhere else in canada does anyone get 70% free money for the purchase price of a house
i am not condemning the program what i am talking about is wouldn t it be far better if people were given a straight across the board 40 or 30 thousand dollars to purchase a house
the average price of a house up here aside from iqaluit everywhere else in nunavut is probably roughly a three bedroom 1200 square foot bungalow is 200 thousand dollars
in my community i have people in public housing that are paying more rent because for some reason past banking experiences and things like that are paying more in public housing than the subsidized government staff housing
the reason they are not in the subsidized government staff housing is because they don t work for government they work for the hamlet or the housing association or things like that
we have been saying that for the past three months that we need more public housing units for the people in need that don t have the employment opportunities that a lot more people have
so i won t dwell on that much longer other than that i think it should be looked at
community empowerment
baker lake and i think cape dorset and i think there are a few other communities really went out and wanted to take control of their own destiny and decision making and thinks like that
but we have an old saying now in places where we have taken over everything the government wants to give us all the empowerment we want without the money
i don t think communities should be forced into community empowerment i think that should be their decisions
at this point or stage in the game the only thing that baker lake hasn t taken over to this point today is hiring nurses and teachers
so community empowerment has worked in our community i think it should be a priority of this government at the community s own pace
it has been a successful endeavour
so i don t want to see us deviating from community empowerment or to de-emphasize it don t take this wrong where the government may want to take some of the things back
this is where it comes to where i hope the government will help more in monitoring and evaluating and training in regards to community empowerment
i don t think we are ready for block funding yet but that may be down the road
i think there is a tremendous tremendous lack of recognition for elders housing in communities
talking with mayors and just people on the street i know in my community we have four designated elders units and we have over 100 elders
we are trying to convert single one bedroom units that were designed for single people into elders residences
we all know the dark side when elders are living in houses with extended families and the drain on them financially
sometimes it is not very good what happens to them
you can comment on this if you like but it is just statements again
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
minister anawak would you like to make a comment to his statements
hon jack anawak
thank you
edap is the program which pays a percentage of down payment mdap is the program that was put forward by the government of the nwt when it was on its last legs
again these are the kinds of issues that we ran for to try and better serve the residents of nunavut
if there is a better way to deliver something like edap then i am sure we would take a look at it on how better to serve the people who utilize programs like edap
on the issue of community empowerment again we re not going to backtrack on an initiative that the communities like nor are we going to offload certain parts of government programs that we don t like
in terms of community empowerment we ll go along with the program again if we are looking at kingait and qamanittuaq where there have been successes then those are the kinds of areas we want to see
if a community wants to go into discussions on community empowerment it should be at their speed instead of us pushing it down their throat
i have a hard time thinking of these qallunaat sayings down their throat
in terms of community empowerment we want to continue the program of enabling communities to do more for their communities without necessarily putting a financial burden on them because of a lack of planning
it will be at the community s speed
so i think it is just a matter of contact and staying in touch with the communities needs and wants to determine whether we should build an elders facility or not
again knowing that there are certain communities where there are a lot more elders like qamanittuaq and arviat these are two communities where there are a lot of elders
those are the areas where we want to focus since part of the basis for nunavut is respect for our elders
i think that this is the kind of thing that we can take a look at once we get into the planning for what we are going to do about the issue of housing
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
before anybody speaks i would like to recognize the qwmb and mr picco s friend joanasie akumalik mr picco s constituent
i would like to welcome you to the assembly
mr mclean
mr mclean
this will be my final question mr chairman thank you
mr anawak on elders residences and commitments and things like that i know it is late in the game and we are drawing close
i think i am correct in saying that in the current budget no money has been designated for elders residences this year
chairperson interpretation
mr minister
hon jack anawak
there has not been any identified at this time
chairperson interpretation
thank you
according to the list that i have mr alakannuark is next
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
although i forgot what i was going to say it is more of a comment than a question in regards to housing
when we are trying to develop a housing program in nunavut it is very important
how can the communities give your department more support in public housing
i know that the budget is very limited
you stated that you would consult with the communities i know that you will do that and you will require the assistance and support of the community housing organizations
in view of that the hamlet councils in the community is the governing body in the community
for housing maintenance i feel that we could utilize the co-ops to do that housing maintenance because there are so many homeless people in our communities
i know that we have to work on this issue for i don t know how many years
i just wanted to throw that suggestion out
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
i don t think this was a question i think it was more in line of a suggestion for the future
mr minister you can respond to it if you like but i think it was more of a suggestion
thank you
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
this morning i asked the minister responsible for public works about a docking facility for pond inlet
i didn t realize that the transportation department was responsible for that
so my question is about the docking facility in pond inlet which was proposed in 1977 with a year off in between
it was slated to be built in 1999 this wharf or breakwater
i don t see it in the budget estimates did you move this breakwater to the next year
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr minister
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
when you asked me earlier today i didn t think i was going to be answering you for the same question
this was not included in the gnwt budgets
they had one slated for the qikiqtaaluk baffin region a breakwater this breakwater was slated for pond inlet but it turned out to be on the b list
so therefore it is now slated for next year
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you
now i understand his explanation so i have no further questions
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
he indicated that these technical positions would be providing assistance to people in homeownership programs
i am wondering if the minister or his staff could explain why there has been such an about face in that
also it was mentioned that they didn t want to be stove piping services
mr chairman i know that previously local housing organizations had only to deal with the housing corporation in every case because the staff housing went through there as well in most cases
within the department of community government housing & transportation it has to deal with two different divisions in there the community government division and the housing division
i am wondering if he could explain how that is not a to me that seems more of a stove piping of services if he could explain how that is not i would appreciate it
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
hon jack anawak
i would like to answer part of it
in terms of the other areas maybe i might get mike to respond to that as well as the technical positions
chairperson interpretation
thank you
deputy minister mike ferris you may proceed
mr ferris
mr chairman on the first point the technical people will provide assistance to anybody that asks related to the potential of new homeownership
that is in their planning stage when they are looking at different designs different types of programs
that request stemmed directly from the district offices of the housing corporation and some of the client groups
that was the basis of getting the technical positions back to provide that type of program assistance to the client group
in terms of stove piping when we talk about stove piping we are talking about individual departments having all the same or duplicated services
that s one of the goals of nunavut is to make it a user friendly type of government
so we re looking at where we can utilize sharing of those types of functions and deliver a good level of service
that s what we re talking about and that s happening as well across departments
we have had discussions and we are working with public works and local authorities housing authorities to try to make access to technical information and access to the departments easy
some of it is still in the planning and discussion stages we have just started to have discussions and so has public works with the lho s on public works having a contract with them for the maintenance
on the break water usually we get contributions from the year before and i know that it will continue on to this year
and the main estimates $ 175 thousand dollars but our plan which we agreed to $ 250 thousand that s the only problem i have but i don t have any problems with the b list
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr chairman
when we go to the transportation department you will have that opportunity to talk about that issue under
7 - 13 can you wait till we get to that item
you could wait till we get to that item mr iqaqrialu
at this time we haven t reach that item yet and you may ask the question to the minister
if you have any questions in regards to that issue do you have any other concerns or comments
no thank you
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i just realised looking over some of the other things i know the minister and the aim of the government in general had been looking at the stream lining the government making it more efficient
this one looking in their information provided to standing committee back last month it shows the total of $ 11 and a half million dollars in salaries for the departments
the 3 regional functions the 3 regional offices all together equal only 47% of those salaries
mr chairman i was wondering if the staff can explain why over half of that salaries for the entire department are in the headquarters function and rather than the regional function
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
either the deputy or the minister can respond to him
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
if the headquarter salaries which is just over $ 6 million dollars and the other the 3 regional ones are all two of them under $ 2 million and one just under 3
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
thank you mr tootoo
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
no that s not what i m getting i guess what i m getting at is we talked about the streamlining of government becoming more effective more efficient
is there something that as a result of amalgamation more of a building a huge bureaucracy than about putting the dollars in the regional level in providing the system to each of our communities at that level
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
thank you mr tootoo
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
well i m not too worried about the percentages as long as those people whether they re headquarters or regional are dedicated to serving the interests of the people of nunavut
chairperson
thank you mr anawak
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i guess another question is he indicated headquarters in a number of different places in the information that was provided to us last month
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr anawak hon jack anawak
interpretation
thank you in respect to the staff who are headquarters staff they are there in the communities and also we re trying to look at ways to save our funds
we ll keep looking because for nunavut staff that ll be one of their prime goals to try and lessen the expenditures and that s what i thought when the deputy minister alluded to this
they were not in the footprints ii model when i was interim commissioner
we hired the assistant deputy ministers outside of footprints ii model and because the majority are inuit they re more aware of inuit culture and language as the government is evolving
but in respect to lessening the funding or ensuring that we re not spending our funding the assistant deputy minister for housing would be moved to rankin inlet and it s right in the middle
they would travel to cambridge bay or kugluktuk repulse bay igloolik or the other communities
that would lessen the cost of the travel if it were based in rankin inlet
so again we re looking for ways to cut down the costs
mr chairman mike ferris would like to make an addition
chairperson interpretation
sometimes i forget your name mr ferris you may proceed
mike ferris
mr chairman i just wish to assure the member on this question we re not building a bureaucracy
there has to be some rework of the salary figures but just so the members are aware there are 98 positions regionally and there are 87 headquarters positions
the regions are already larger than headquarters combined and the minister indicated a number of headquarter positions outside of iqaluit and we will be operating very close to those communities
i think some of the difficulty in the clear identification of the salaries is trying to capture the housing salary component and there s a tendency to lump those salaries in under headquarters even the district operations
we will be working with finance and we started that process just to make sure that the charges we have to capture for housing are clearly identified in one budget area
i think that s where you look at the percentage it may not reflect exactly what s in the field there are 98 in total regional positions in present time verses 87 in headquarters
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ferris
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i would just like to confirm what the deputy minister was saying is that the headquarters amounts for salaries includes all the housing costs for the entire department
is that what he is saying mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr ferris
mr ferris
mr chairman i can t say that it includes all the costs for housing
i think in that process we have identified a couple of areas where the numbers don t reflect exactly where the positions are
that will be sorted out and that will be much clearer once we have had an opportunity to work it through the full process
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
will we be provided with that information at some point in the future
because if the information that we have isn t totally accurate it would be nice to have the information that is accurate
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
deputy minister ferris
mr ferris
that would be made available through the minister but as i say that is where the trick is is working out the housing corporation and keeping those figures as separate for accounting purposes
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
now i am concerned and we are seeing more headquarters positions leaving here
i would just like to clarify that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
in respect to the question posed by mr tootoo i believe it s within 7-4 under the directorate and i believe that it is listed there
perhaps when we reach that page you can repeat your question at that time mr tootoo
i believe it is on page 7-4
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
actually mr chairman i believe it is the assistant deputy minister for community government
but as it is i am not dealing just with that department it is a departmental headquarters function i am wondering about
it is not just specifically to that department it is more of from an overall department that they are moving headquarters positions from out of iqaluit
i would like some clarification to that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
deputy minister ferris
i am sorry minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
there will be only one position that will be transferred out
there is the one position however we will look into that and especially with the positions being transferred to the communities
but as the staff transfers to the communities occurs we will be dealing with that but in the meantime there is only that one position is moving
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
i no longer have anybody on my list for questions
now to get into the main estimates
as to the members wishes do you want to go into the details of expenditures
starting with 7-4 listed as the directorate
operations & maintenance
total operations & maintenance 12 million 255 thousand dollars
are you agreed
some members
agreed
chairperson interpretation
capital items
total capital nil
therefore the total expenditures for the directorate is 12 million 255 thousand
are you agreed
wait a second
there is a question from one of the members
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman this is the directorate and covers emergency services
i am wondering if the minister could provide us with some detail in regards to that division
it is something that there does not seem to be a whole lot of detail or any detail on these services here in the main estimates
i wonder if he could provide us with that information
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
there is a question in respect to emergency services by a member
perhaps the deputy minister mr ferris can respond
mr ferris
mr ferris
thank you mr chairman
in the emergency services division there will be eleven py s
we have identified special initiative funding of 350 thousand to improve and enhance our fire prevention training
that is coupled with some additional dollars for general training in the emo
there is also within the travel and transportation amount which would be under your other operations & maintenance figure would be the dollars for the travel by the staff of emergency services into communities
we are looking at enhancing the preventative side of whether it is search and rescue or fire training
there is a enhanced budget for that in what is being proposed here
there is also we want to breakdown the fire training dollars a little better there is 150 thousand that we will hold in headquarters to allocate to new training initiatives
the regions will get 50 thousand in the baffin 50 thousand in the keewatin and 88 thousand in the kitikmeot because there are some commitments to enhancing training given the major school fire there
we will be offering training for fire-fighters in three levels
basic fire fighting fire investigation and fire command officer training
that is part and parcel of the directorate operation
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ferris
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
maybe just for clarification i don t know if i should ask it here as it is emergency services or ask it in transportation
in regards to the services that are going to be developed for the airport i am just wondering if that is something that is more properly addressed in the transportation part
maybe i could just ask for some clarification on that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
deputy minister ferris
mr ferris
in the emergency services branch will also be what was known as the protective services unit for airports
it will be a combined emergency services unit that responds to all the peacetime emergencies whether they are wind oriented or aircraft oriented
in the regulatory requirements that is identified as a separate item and it should really be titled instead of ers at 1 3 million it should be phase 1 regulatory improvements to iqaluit airport
there is a requirement for us to re-establish ers
we have allocated that 1 3 for that and in discussions with transport canada in terms of getting cost shared not only on that item but on other items for that regulatory requirement
the iqaluit airport has now been designated as part of the national airport system because this is the capital now of a territorial jurisdiction so we join the other capitals with having a national airport
that has done two things it has changed the level of security requirements at the airport and it requires the return of the ers services
chairperson
thank you mr ferris
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the assistant deputy minister indicated the return of the ers services
did we used to have those services in the past and since they have been gone who was providing them
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr deputy minister mike ferris
mr ferris
mr chairman yes there were ers services operating at the airport and they were part of the gnwt deficit recovery i guess
what we are looking at is bringing them on in a phased approach and offset as much of the capital outlay with funding from transport canada
they haven t given us sufficient funding
why did the gnwt give us very little
there have been cuts in all the existing programs that we have had for a number of years and it causes us problems
if there are going to be cuts it is not going to be very good
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu thank you
he ll get advice from his advisors first
mr minister
hon jack anawak interpretation
as i said before we grandfathered these from the government of the northwest territories
once these estimates are approved we can shuffle the numbers around
it s a very small number that we are talking about here
i can t say directly but i can say that we can shuffle some numbers around
there was one community that came over and told us that we were supposed to give them some money and it was deferred for another year
so they were proposing to do whatever project they wanted to do this year and then get reimbursed the following year
so the communities can do the same thing

ministers statement 20 - 1 2 nunavut commemorative coin
hon paul okalik interpretation
mr speaker i am pleased today to join with my federal colleagues in announcing the royal canadian mint s launch of a commemorative coin celebrating the creation of nunavut
as we know the creation of nunavut on april 1 represented a dramatic change
on the eve of a new millennium the people of nunavut began a new journey
yet as we embrace our future and all it s opportunities we hold fast to our past
nunavut represents the opportunity for its residents to govern themselves in a way that s meaningful and sensitive to their rich and diverse culture
much of that richness mr speaker has been kept alive through the drum which has long been a tool of communication in inuit culture
our ancestors used the beat of the drum and the song of drummer to describe our legends and adventures to younger generations
our heritage is abundant with these stories
designed by igloolik artist germaine arnaktauyok the coin portrays an inuit man absorbed in a drum dance
the drum bears the image of a map outlining nunavut
inside the map is a qulliq
ms arnaktauyok well known for her illustrations in children s books reflects in this design her cultural roots
her talent allows her to capture beautifully her continuing interest in traditional myths and stories as she explores the folklore of her ancestors
the image of a drummer on this special coin is significant as a symbol to the people of nunavut
it connects us to our past
ms arnaktauyok captures the spirit of the drum dancer in this stunning figure which graces the reverse of this newest addition to the mint s millennium coin series
ms arnaktauyok says the drum signifies that the people will be heard near and far
the imagery of the qulliq on this coin is also a strong symbol for the people of nunavut
traditionally the seal oil lamp was a source of warmth
in the present it remains a visible link to our past
we are fortunate and proud to have our symbols recognized through the talents of ms arnaktauyok
we also welcome the opportunity to share these symbols of nunavut with canada and the world through this special coin

information on sole source contract
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
over the last couple of days a number of members have raised questions about a sole source consulting contract entered into by the department of the executive & intergovernmental affairs
i would like to emphasise that this is a service contract although it has been referred to in this house as an employment contract
the terms of the consulting service contract fall clearly within section 1 3 of the purchasing guidelines contained in the contracting procedures adopted by the government of nunavut
the process prescribed in the procedures was followed by the department of the executive & intergovernmental affairs and was approved by the department of public works telecommunications and technical services
pwt&ts this consulting service contract was done on a sole-source contracting basis
it was made in the following context
two departments pwtts and hr do not have deputy ministers
two departments facing major initiatives are significantly understaffed health & social services and education
the headquarter functions of the nunavut public service is staffed at approximately less than 30% based on information to date
department of human resources is operating at more than its current capacity to handle the high volume of staffing actions
for example an average job advertisement and accompanying job description is developed and classified through the department of human resources which is estimated to be 1-3 weeks
that finalized job advertisement then sent for production which requires 2 weeks for he preparation of the media advertisement
upon the closing of the competition each department then screens the applicants conducts interviews and within 2-4 weeks the new civil servant is on strength
the best recruitment time frame estimated by the department of executive & intergovernmental affairs is approximately 8-10 weeks
employees at all levels have been working beyond the call of duty from the months prior to and since april 1 1999
and finally mr speaker this house has requested that the implementation plans for the phasing out of the boards of health and social services and of education be presented for review in september
under these circumstances the department of the executive & intergovernmental affairs officials made the decision to hire on a contract basis a very experienced former deputy minister with extensive knowledge of government departments the north and nunavut
his services have been made available to a number of departments based on their needs under the direction of the department of the executive & intergovernmental affairs
the consulting service contract is short term
the rate of pay is consistent with the rate of pay at the deputy minister level
there is no job security
the consultant is paid on a per day basis
there are no employment benefits
the consulting service contract provides the nunavut public service with experience support and knowledgeable back up in difficult circumstances
the benefits and the experience of the consultant will be spread out to various departments in the government
mr speaker we in this house have a difficult task in front of us
we must ensure that there is a smooth transition once the boards of health and education are phased out
we must ensure that valuable programs and services are in placed for nunavummiut
mr speaker i am pleased that work is underway for this transition
i am also looking forward to september when we will have an opportunity to review these transition plans together
mr speaker later today i will be tabling the terms of reference for this contract

inuuqatigiit curriculum
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker mr speaker i would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge a curriculum document called inuuqatigiit which is based on inuit values beliefs and traditions
it seems fitting at this time to recognize something that has led the way in using inuit culture as a basis as we establish our new government
inuuqatigiit was developed by a steering committee consisting of inuit teachers and teaching and learning centre staff from across the nwt they consulted elders educators and others for the content
after 3 years of gathering information and developing the document it began to be implemented in 1996
it is the first curriculum documenting inuit culture so it does not contain everything anyone would want to know about inuit
we have to remember that not all of the beliefs customs or content pertain to all inuit groups as there are some differences between them
the document is written in english only but an inuktitut version will be published this spring which was initiated by the baffin dec teaching & learning centre
resources and material to support inuuqatigiit will be developed over time this year our department is going to undergo a curriculum and resource development strategy to address areas of great need and identify priorities
i am presenting each of the members a copy of the curriculum document and urge them to visit their schools to find our more about how they are implementing inuuqatigiit
there are excellent programs and activities run by nunavut educators
we have a long way to go in resource development but our department is starting to work with the teaching and learning centre staff and the divisional education councils to address this
mr speaker we have a big task ahead of us and the inuuqatigiit curriculum is s major foundation for education
i would like to thank all the educators who have been involved in the development of the document and particularly the elders who passed on their knowledge and wisdom
in addition i would like to acknowledge honourable manitok thompson minister of public works telecommunications and technical services who was in on the first development meetings
the education system as a whole is embracing nunavut s past and adapting to the future
with this the following areas will be addressed over time to ensure nunavut s culture is the basis curriculum contentteacher and leadership trainingserving students and communitiesthe education act policies and regulationslearning programs and materialstaff support and human resource development
inuit values and customs within the school validate that the student s culture has a place and is affirmed in the school environment
this is changing in our schools as they become more community-based and are leading the way in this area
cultural relevancy in schools is not just a nunavut issue the world in general is grappling and trying to deal with diverse cultures within their education systems
some curricula that is taught in southern canada and other countries are having to be reformed to acknowledge their students who are from diverse backgrounds
there is resistance to change for some unfortunately in areas where they have aboriginal or diverse groups of people their own people are not acknowledged in their own school system and curricula
nunavut is privileged to be on the forefront of some aboriginal groups in beginning to establish a school system that is based on its own roots and history
our system has changed from one that slapped our hands if we spoke our language and denied culturally who we were
if a person from another country asks a nunavut student who he is as an inuk what his history is and what language he speaks he can stand solidly reply with honesty and dignity
so mr speaker i reiterate that our education system has to ensure students leave our school system with a stronger sense of inuit identity and respect for others this is what the inuuqatigiit curriculum is standing on

suicide in nunavut
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i hope that this will come out properly or in the right context so i have to give a little bit of background
i wish to speak of something that s occurring in nunavut
back around 1984-85 or so in our community suicides started occurring
from my own recollection to date those number of suicides are many this year alone 1999 there have been several people who have committed suicide through out nunavut in many communities
in respect to this issue mr speaker we have all worked hard trying prevent suicide
i used to be involved with our youth suicide prevention
we have looked at many options and have debated this issue many times
in 1985 my older brother committed suicide and just after that my younger brother also committed suicide and my sister also committed suicide in 1990 and she was the last from my family
mr speaker this issue is something we have touched us all
how strong we have to be to face this difficult issue
we have tried to slow the suicide rate the suicide rate of young people
and mr speaker to date nobody has been able to find out the real root cause for suicide
yes we can assume that they have a specific reasons but a real understanding has never been found to date
mr speaker we have to pray for our children pray that the suicide rates fall
i have known this from my own experiences
i still pray for our young people to try and save them

thank you mr speaker
earlier the premier talked about this two dollar coin which was designed to commemorate nunavut
i wanted to add my own comments to that

members statements 68 - 1 2 respect for inuit traditional knowledge
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this morning i would like to make a statement to the people of nunavut in respect to the traditional knowledge of the inuit as it relates to the nunavut government
we have stated we will be closer to the nunavut government
we keep referring to this and i am very happy that i am dressed in my traditional clothing to make a statement in the house
this is a very good principal for the government to adhere to to be closer to the people of nunavut again as we have stated that when we get the nunavut government we will be closer to the people
the inuit traditional knowledge and wisdom we have stated that will be our base
mr speaker we have heard that we will be a different government and i am very happy that is the case
it was stated that it was being tested in alberta
with respect to that issue mr speaker i want to state that within this legislative assembly that the inuit of nunavut their knowledge their culture their values and customs we stated that they were to be our base
but no where is the inuit wisdom where is the culture and i am using this as an example for gjoa haven because they stated it was bad gas and they believe in it but this was not reflected
speaker interpretation
could you please sit down mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
mr speaker i want to add some more comments if that is okay
i am seeking unanimous consent i would like to finish my comments
speaker interpretation
mr puqiqnak is seeking unanimous consent to finish his comments
are there any nays
mr puqiqnak you have consent to proceed
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
where are the inuit traditional knowledge it seems that the operations are still like the gnwt of yesterday and we seem to be following that
our wisdom and our cultural beliefs and values it seems like they are being sloughed off
mr speaker the nunavut government has to respect their residents
also mr speaker the 36 thousand dollars that was expended for the testing of the gasoline
just as an example to use that 36 thousand dollars the damage that was caused they weren t even given any part of that 36 thousand dollars
again the respect that the nunavut government should have for its residents for that seemed to be an aberration from our statements
again in respecting our residents i think we have to stick to that principal

regarding the mla from gjoa haven he seemed to indicate to us during his statement that we are not reflecting inuit cultural values and stated that i did not believe the wishes of the gjoa haven residents

members statement 69 - 1 2 concern about nunavut islands
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i stated a concern of mine earlier respecting the hudson bay and james bay islands
these islands are in hudson s bay and james bay
they re called long island and bear island north and south twin islands akipskie and other islands
mr speaker the premier previously made a statement and i understand that it is dealt with within the land claim agreement specifically article 15 3 8
mr speaker i am still very concerned about status of these islands because there are three aboriginal peoples who have great interest in these islands including the cree and the quebec inuit as well as the sanikiluaq inuit
these islands are a point of contention and they are within the nunavut territory
i hope that in the future if there is any kind of dialogue about these islands that the residents of sanikiluaq are involved

at this time i would like to give my appreciation to all of my fellow mla s and especially my wife
she is sick at this moment and she has never given me any complaints
i speak to her every day and she is being looked after by our children
i wanted to praise her here
additionally i would like to see within nunavut that there be less problems between the members because even small things can become a problem and we cannot make any progress
because of that fact if we had less obstacles although it may be hard let s not blame each other if we work in co-operation there will be progress and i wanted to make a statement on that

members statement 71 - 1 2 road link to keewatin
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker one of the many ways in which nunavut is unique is the fact that all the territories communities are accessible to the rest of canada only by air and by sea
we do not have to accept this situation forever
for example the province of prince edward island has recently achieved a mainland link at a cost of some several hundred million dollars
mr speaker with enough persistence and strong will we also can accomplish this and i believe our premier has these genuine abilities
mr speaker it has been a long time that the keewatin has had the dream of a link between the keewatin and the south
for many years this dream has eluded us we talked about studies restudies evaluations
mr speaker i think the time has come to act
mr speaker this country was brought together by such projects as the cp rail line and the trans-canada highway
we are linked from east to west coast to coast it is now time to focus on north - south ties
mr speaker this is a win-win situation for all of nunavut
the benefits of a permanent road connection are obvious
reduced transportation costs will save money for fuel food housing construction
the savings in this area will allow more money to be spent on other projects in other regions such the baffin and the kitikmeot
mr speaker in churchill they receive approximately 7 thousand tourists per year
these tourists come in to churchill to view the polar bears that migrate into that area and they stop there
there is no reason why these 7 thousand tourists or a portion of them could not continue on if we had a road link to the keewatin
this again will put many dollars back into the communities and provide the tourists with an opportunity to benefit and see the arctic way of life

members statements 73 - 1 2 inuuqatigiit curriculum
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
when mr arvaluk was talking about inuuqatigiit being developed and to be taught to inuit teachers teaching and learning staff across nunavut
i am very proud that they are doing this and i know many of the educators worked very hard to develop this document and interviewing people to find out what kind of culture we have
we do have differing cultures in kitikmeot baffin and kivalliq
there are also sub-cultures paaliqmiut natilingmiut as well
the differences in cultures of these people when we are talking about them sometimes there are disagreements about what is inuit
some of the elders may believe that this is a true inuit way but because of the differences in culture they differ in opinion
for example in inuuqatigiit it says that the elders believe that when a woman cannot have a child anymore if she eats caribou fur she will be able to conceive
sometimes the kids can start to believe that and since the inuit teachers are going to be teaching about inuuqatigiit this is good but we have different beliefs and we have different cultures
even though inuit share a same language we have different dialects mr speaker
i am very glad to see that this is being developed by education mr speaker thank you

oral questions mr puqiqnak
item 6 oral questions
question 102 - 1 2
formalised plan for taloyoak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister of sustainable development
my question is that in taloyoak after the mayor and the senior administrative officer came into town for a meeting with the housing corporation
i am aware of what they are doing but i think that through sustainable development there needs to be a plan formalised
i wonder if there is a plan being worked on through that department
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
minister of sustainable development mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the subject that the member is talking about has already been completed and a report and a plan has already been sent to the hamlet
thank you mr speaker

thank you mr minister
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
since he say s that he cannot say anything else at this time and i understand what he is saying but we have seen progress and also completed a good exercise in the community
i want the minister to be aware of the work that was done and maybe the same thing could be done by his department
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
minister of sustainable development mr kilabuk

question 103 - 1 2 pond inlet landfill site

this is directed to the minister responsible for community government s

i wonder if there are some funds available to restore this old land field site
speaker interpretation

mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation

thank you mr speaker
mr speaker
oral questions mr akesuk
question 104 - 1 2 status of adult education school project
mr akesuk
my question is directed to the minister of pwtts
in cape dorset we were supposed to get something from the gnwt they had approved this project
specifications were already done for the building and they were approved and the site was even identified
the project number is 4-001796
in cape dorset adult students are using the high school
we want to see the building go up as soon as possible because the existing schools are already crowded
i wonder what the status of the project is if we are not going to get the adult education centre then perhaps the minister consider making an addition to the existing school that is being used for adult education
speaker interpretation
thank you
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation perhaps this question should be put to the minister of education
i will have to find out if the contract was already awarded
if funds have been identified than we can start working on a project
the money would have to be coming from the department of education and also even though many of the projects have been approved by the other government we are now under a new government
i think that we can all understand this
but in reply to the member s question is that we do not have this information in detail
i will find out it if the contract was awarded and if the funds have been identified
speaker interpretation

oral questions mr iqaqrialu
question 104 - 1 2 polar bear regulations
mr iqaqrialu interpretation i started asking this question yesterday regarding polar bears in my community of clyde river
we see a lot of polar bears these days and in the past few years
the regulations in place now that have been put in place by those who look after polar bears is not consistent the legislation which was put in place originally
i wonder if this can be looked into by the minister of sustainable development
thank you mr speaker

question 105 - 1 2 social worker shortage in arviat
mr o brien
my questions are directed to the minister responsible for health and social services
last night i received a call from mayor king from my community concerned about the number of social services staff in the arviat office
mr speaker it is my understanding that there is only one individual in the office when normally there would be five
the individual that is there is a level one which is a junior entry position and they are quite concerned with the situation and wonder how long it will stay the way it is
when can we expect to see some staff back in the arviat office
speaker interpretation
thank you
mr picco minister of health and social services
mr picco
i was not aware either of the situation regarding the social workers in arviat
what i will do now that i have heard about this problem from the member is that we will contact the department and have them direct some questions
the regional health and services board will find out when indeed when the full complement of social workers will be put in place in arviat

question 105 - 1 2 iqaluit hospital
mr tootoo
earlier last week or this week i cannot remember now the government announced the go ahead of a p3 project in arviat
i would like to ask the minister if the process which was also supposed to be used to look at the hospital here in iqaluit
could he please provide us with the status of where that is right now
speaker interpretation thank you mr tootoo the question was directed to you mr picco
thank you mr speaker
i can speak to it but the minister responsible for the p3 projects is the minister of finance
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation thank you mr picco
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
as you know the cabinet has adopted the principles of supporting p3 as one of the funding initiatives in trying to assist us in bringing forward our infrastructure
speaker interpretation thank you mr ng second question mr tootoo
mr tootoo
i guess what i hear the minister saying is that prior to any movement on these projects there expecting to review the report from the department of health
can i ask the minister when he expects these reports to be ready
speaker interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
the department of health has been given thirty days to turn around the functional review to assess the functional programs of the three facilities as we realize the expectations of time lines
we are trying to deliver these programs in as timely a fashion as possible
speaker interpretation
thank you mr ng
third supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
i guess i am asking this because it is my understanding that there were some dollars that were allocated for the design of this facility
i am wondering if these will also be on hold because of this delay
speaker interpretation
thank you
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
speaker interpretation
final supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
i ask the minister if those dollars that were previously allocated for the design of the facility will be on hold as a result of the report
i would like to know if these dollars have been put on hold as a result of this review
speaker interpretation
thank you

hon kelvin ng

as i indicated we are waiting for the department of health to undertake the review and then we will move on from there

oral questions
mr akesuk
question 106 - 1 2 adult education centre
mr akesuk interpretation
possibly i should have directed my question to the minister of education
my question that i directed to miss thompson regarding the adult education or the arctic college that was going to be built in cape dorset
my question is what is the status
we have already used money for the facility
speaker
thank you mr akesuk
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
i believe it was yesterday that we heard mr anawak give us his report
i believe that he was talking about money that was already expended for projects
he said that money was already expended but i would like to tell mr akesuk that even if money was expended it does not necessarily mean that we have the money to build the facility
the nunavut government has stated that only contracts that were already rewarded are going to go ahead this year
we are not only talking about drawing designs for buildings but also health and safety issues for an example a house that may collapse
we have to prioritise those projects that have been awarded already
if your facility does not fall into one of these categories then it will get moved to the next year to be reviewed the following year
it might mean that the blue print has already been drawn but it does not mean that it is going to get built that year because it does not fall into those categories
speaker
thank you mr akesuk
mr akesuk
the cabinet members have just stated that they will only go ahead with projects that have been contracted out already or health and safety issues
it could become a safety issue if the school becomes over crowded
it could become a health and safety issue
i believe that it should be a part of the review
mr speaker mr arvaluk if you would like to respond
hon james arvaluk
speaker interpretation
thank you
mr irqittuq
question 107 - 1 2
student teacher ratio
mr irqittuq interpretation
this question is for the minister of education
in my community of hall beach we have a very small school that does not meet the school population and i am sure that is like that in other places in nunavut
looking at the teachers what is the teacher children ratio in each classroom
that is my question
thank you
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
our goal is to look at the whole school and not necessarily each classroom
the teacher student ratio is 19 1 it would be ideal to have 19 students per teacher
there would be more interaction between the students and the teachers
but i also know that in some communities there are 30 students per teacher in a classroom
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
mr mclean
question 108 - 1 2
arctic college programs and positions
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the minister of education
i wonder if the minister can provide me with a time line and when these positions are going to be moved into the various communities in nunavut
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean and mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
i am not sure right now because we are in discussion right now with the arctic college
we cannot give direction on a daily basis because arctic college has its own board of governors
soon as i am informed of this plan because if it requires additional funding to do this plan then it has to go to the cabinet so it would not be an automatic move
it will be a decision of the cabinet if it becomes a money issue
i can not answer that question until the actual submission or request to the department of education is made is made by arctic college
if that is the plan then other requirements to clear this plan must be initiated
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk second question mr mclean
mr mclean
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes i will provide that information as soon as possible and in fact i will try to get that information before this session is over
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk we still have members who want to ask questions
at this time i will recognize noon hour
we will break for lunch

we will recess until 1 30 pm

oral questions item # 6 we ve only got 33 minutes for the oral questions at this time
mr o brien you are next
question 109 - 1 2 tendering policy
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is directed to the
mr premier
i wonder at this point in times since we are starting off with the new government if the premier is giving any consideration of reviewing the whole policy as relates to tenders
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
mr premier
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
well like everything we could review it as well but if you could specify what you would like change that would help
the reason why we have to use it is because we have deadlines and we are understaffed right now and we re looking for the best people for the positions to do the job in a short period of time
we have to do this otherwise we wouldn t get the job done with current staff that we have so if the member could specify what kind of review that you may want to see it would help
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr okalik
before i ask you for second question mr o brien
sometimes i ve seen members ministers stepping out of this border and that doesn t look good
especially with media around here so i advise you if you have to go out bow to the mace ask the pages to open the border thank you
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker mr speaker to be more precise i guess as far as the issue of the type tendering that we do are the ways which we got contracts out
i think when you look at rfp s and rfq s and sole source contracting that leaves a number of people out of loop
i think in fairness to everybody if we could review these practices to see if we could at least open it up so that the i guess we have a little more transparency and openness and fairness
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
mr okalik
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
i don t see a problem we are going to do a review of contracting policies for article 24 purposes before next years contracting season opens up so i don t see why we can t include all contracts in that process

mr anawak the question was directed to you but if you would refer it to another minister it s your choice mr anawak

oral question mr akesuk
question 114 - 1 2 marine facility
mr akesuk
this capital project was lost in the shuffle i don t think nunavut government allocated any money under capital dollars for marine facility
this is very important program for northerners as you know probably know 2 years ago gnwt had to cover the cost of lost of the boats
mr speaker a lot of the cost could have been prevented if cape dorset had a break water at that time it was already to go
i think capital dollars was transferred over to the nunavut government
are we going to get this project in the near future
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr akesuk
mr anawak minister of community government
hon jack anawak
interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes i understand his question i know that most of the communities have requested a breakwater or a wharf and i know that they are in need of breakwater

thank you mr anawak
in respect to the yesterdays meeting where we had to stop the meeting we were dealing with 7-5 i believe we were supposed to get back to 7-5
just underneath it total operations and maintenance $ 35 million 9 hundred 22 thousand are you agreed
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman yesterday on the last remarks i believe another member from the baffin was asking about the project in the community
the minister indicated he said that the capital funding went to the prove it could be shuffled around after
i d like some clarification on whether that can happen or once we approve this capital on these projects is that what s it s for i d like to know if it can be shuffled around after as minister indicated yesterday
thank you mr chairman
hon jack anawak
they want to delay a particular project and move up the arena and with the money that was allotted for the capital they want to prioritise the hockey arena
if that s the case i could tell the financial management board we could put it back to the financial management board and move it to a different project
i used kimmirut as an example as to their priorities and that s what i was referring to
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo has that answered your question
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
i thought i did ask the question
then the minister is saying that once capital dollars have been committed they can be moved from one project to another in other words adding new projects to the capital plan
is that what the minister is indicating thank you mr chairperson
no we will not produce more finances but with regard to the community of kimmirut their priorities and their allotted capital plan for this year are not the same
chairperson
thank you mr anawak
i m sorry you cannot state it here
just kidding
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairperson maybe just to put some clarity to the issue in respect to how departments deal with their budgets
there are regulations obviously surrounding that and if the financial management board approves it the supplementary appropriation for that move comes back to the assembly for a vote
that s the process in place
thank you
sorry so in effect anything that they do that we do as a government to recognize priorities government wide community wide it comes back to the vote to the assembly
there is nothing that could be done without members being involved in that decision even though it may be after the fact in respect to government priorities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo do you understand now the process to change the priorities
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
i have nothing to add mr chairperson
just kidding
in respect to page 7 6 the bottom the bottom detail the garbage packer for the pond inlet total
i m not sure what it s really geared towards and i would like to understand what the garbage packer is
because in inuktitut this states that it s a garbage box in inuktitut
chairperson interpretation
perhaps minister anawak will answer that
continue mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
this is a garbage truck which opens up and compacts the garbage
that s what it s supposed to be
that s what it is in actuality
chairperson interpretation
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you for giving a good answer
chairperson interpretation
my list of names in respect to baffin details are gone
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
i might make a mistake mr chairperson
i would like to move to 7-8
chairperson interpretation
mr puqiqnak we re almost there
if you can be patient
i don t think there are any more questions in respect to the baffin total capital
detail of capital the total the baffin total is 5 million 718 thousand
are you agreed
in respect to the keewatin region the keewatin total is 3 million 903 thousand
are you agreed
agreed
the kitikmeot total is 1 million 163 thousand
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
i m kind of confused here
chairperson interpretation
at this point we re on 7-8 in respect to the kitikmeot total
the detail capital the keewatin region total was already agreed and that s on 7-7
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
mr chairperson in respect to the kitikmeot total i saw a cambridge bay total and saw kugluktuk as well as taloyoak but in respect to the various communities detail there is no reference to gjoa haven
chairperson interpretation
hold on mr puqiqnak
be patient
they re looking for your concern
hon jack anawak interpretation
i will ask my deputy minister to respond to the question
chairperson
mr ferris
mr ferris
mr chairperson the projects for gjoa haven are actually found in the nunavut incremental infrastructure work which is under the federal funding agreement for nunavut incremental infrastructure there is 9 million 311 thousand dollars
there were no projects specifically in gjoa haven other than we ve got some independent housing
there is an access road and those are the two from our department in gjoa haven
education and health has projects
the other ones mr chairperson may be ones that would be found in the nunavut incremental infrastructure because that s one of the impacted communities
chairperson interpretation
mr puqiqnak
do you have additional comments
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i m aware that in year 1999 - 2000 the community had prioritized their projects for those years
after we were in parish hall like i said i wanted to see that project happen before i lost all may hair
i said that in parish hall
but there is nothing under nunavut community government
because the community is also looking for projects but there are not projects planned for 1999 - 2000
i m looking at is there going to be some infrastructure and is there going to be airstrip improvement our community hall is too small now and there is also a garage and a sewage building
they re not on the list at all
that s why i wanted to know what actually was happening in gjoa haven
thank you
chairperson interpretation
jack anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
i m sorry
we want to get everything completed before you lose all your hair too but at this time i apologize that it s not for this year
it has been put off for the fiscal year
it was put over to the next year because there needs to be some planning done had to be drawn up
that s all i m able to respond to you at this time
perhaps when we go to gjoa haven we will be able to meet with the hamlet council
chairperson interpretation
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
also i don t see any projects for pelly bay
the school in our community received a letter
i d seen a letter about that 1998 to year 2000
there is nothing slated for that community about the school
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr alakannuark
so if you could be patient
i think they re searching for what you are talking about
i m sorry
you were talking about the community hall
mr alakannuark
thank you mr chairman
i m talking about the school gymnasium
we received a letter and i saw that letter last winter in the year 1999 year 2000 that they were going to get an improvement or renovations done but i don t see that in the main estimates
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
perhaps the minister of education can further clarify you on that but there are no funds
no funds have been identified this year for specifications for the school gymnasium
mr alakannuark did you want to ask another question
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman that s all i had
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr o brien
mr o brien
just for a point of clarification
are we on community government right now
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien we re on community government
projects kitikmeot
keewatin was already passed
we are now on kitikmeot section
you understand now mr o brien
mr o brien
mr chairman is it possible to go back to one issue under the keewatin i have a question on that
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien wants to return to keewatin
do you agree
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman and colleagues
under the keewatin under nuvuk residential subdivision 1 6 million dollars
i wonder if the minister could be so kind as to give some details or rationale as to what this project entails
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
mr ferris
mr ferris
thank you mr chairman
a year ago there was a new subdivision opened up in rankin inlet
there was buried pipe put in the ground
so we re honouring that commitment in terms of the loan that rankin inlet got to do the full subdivision and to reimburse them for what would have been the territorial government s share
chairperson interpretation
thank you
o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
so basically this money is already spent and the work is already completed
is this expenditure primarily for utilidor work or is it actual land assembly
chairperson interpretation
mr ferris
mr ferris
under the agreement or under the policy that the territorial government had for lot development there was an average lot price established and think it was around about 50 thousand dollars
for example in kimmirut because of the hill structure there the lots are very expensive
so there has been a subsidy that s been provided out of the capital plan dollars for developmental lots in that community
there are a few others where the price is beyond what s considered a reasonable price to ask an individual to pay to lease land and that s where this flows out of and that s because of buried pipe
buried pipe lot development is very expensive there as it is here in iqaluit
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
this policy that it seems to me that i guess cut and dry somewhat flexible
are you saying this policy applies for the people here in iqaluit
that there is funding available to subsidize the price of lots but it varies from community to community
chairperson interpretation
mr ferris
mr ferris
that is how the policy has been applied
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
can the minister tell me what the average that s the term that you used average cost of a lot in rankin is as opposed to the average cost of a lot here in iqaluit
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak this is your question
hon jack anawak
if he wants to get the fairly good accurate dollar amounts then if he can just bear with me we ll get the information
chairperson interpretation
last one mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
can the minister tell me what the policy is for installing utilidor services in the other communities
is there a reason why you just can t have utilidor service why it has to be only in iqaluit rankin and who ever else might have it
is it in within your policy to expand this beyond these communities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
you have to understand that mr chairman we re less than two months old and we haven t developed a policy
the policies that we inherited are from the government of the nwt and at this point in time that s the policy we re following
chairperson interpretation
since this was your last one mr o brien
go ahead however
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
i appreciate that
that did not quite answer my question
mr chairman i was asking what the policy is in relationship to hooking up other smaller communities putting them on the utility system
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr ferris
mr ferris
that s why it s only in limited communities and mainly in taxed based where they have the ability to raise the additional dollars to cover the costs
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr tootoo are you asking about keewatin or do you want to go back to the baffin region or keewatin
we are currently under keewatin
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i know exactly where we are
i think projects or any of the capital any member from anywhere should be able to ask if it effects the capital for the whole territory in this department
on the what the deputy minister is saying this covers off a percentage of those costs or the project could the minister inform us of the 1 6 million what percentage of the project did that cover
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr ferris
mr ferris
mr chairman we can provide the member with the cost but that was a project by the territorial government
i ll have to go back to the files to get that
it seems to me that the cost of land development was close to 3 3 and one half million dollars but i will produce the information
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo please make your question clear
mr tootoo
i thought i did mr chairman
but i ll try and do better
thank you
could the minister also again i m looking for that information he indicated that this cost was this year s share
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr ferris
mr ferris
mr chairman there is no work going on in nuvuk subdivision this year
the project was complete
this is a contractual arrangement and that s why when we use the criteria it fit within the criteria
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the minister also said that the policy allowed for what the government can consider
i know there is three communities in nunavut with utilidor iqaluit being one of them
has the policy been used and considered in other communities especially here in iqaluit
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr ferris
mr ferris
for example if that was done in iqaluit if they wanted to use old funds for a project the government can look at it to see how much we can help them out with
does that answer your question
mr tootoo
thank you
i guess what i was asking is has this policy been used or will it be used in the cost of the lots being developed here in iqaluit
the new lots up the hill are when i first saw the price up around 70 thousand dollars per lot
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
we ve already dealt with baffin region
we were in keewatin and then we asked to go back to keewatin and we re just dealing with that one question right now
perhaps mr tootoo you can have your own private meeting now that is done but however i ll let mr ferris respond
mr ferris
thank you mr chairman at the present time under that policy tax-based municipalities because of their additional funding based on the ability to generate their own tax revenue are not covered under that same policy
chairperson interpretation
does that answer your question
maybe you should take some inuktitut lessons so that when you are bilingual it would be easier for you to understand everything
let s go back to our item on hand
do i have to ask for agreement again
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
i don t know if this is a final order mr chairman or not but i don t appreciate the comments that were just made by the chairperson
it s not my fault i don t speak inuktitut other members are here that don t speak inuktitut i mean if i wanted to i could say the same thing to you in english but i won t
i take exception to those comments and i would sincerely hope that the chairman would look at the rules of the house and make sure that they re followed by everybody
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
since i m the chairperson we re trying to keep order and we re trying to get ahead and that s why i made those comments
do we have to get an agreement to go back our normal item
keewatin total 3 million 903 thousand do you agree
and now to get back to 7-8 capital for kitikmeot total 1 million 163 thousand
agreed
for all of nunavut capital total 50 million
agreed
community government total capital 10 million 833 thousand
to go back to 7 5 total capital 10 million 833 thousand
agreed
total expenditures 46 million 755 thousand 7-9 housing
operations and maintenance total 33 million 243 thousand
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman underneath the operations and maintenance here i believe it covers off the contributions to the local housing organizations and authorities here in iqaluit and those other organizations and all their communities
mr chairman i d like to ask the minister if the funding to those organizations has stayed the same increased or decreased and how these numbers relate to last year
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
mr chairman by and large the funding has stayed the same as the previous year and the funding usually is derived per capita
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman mr chairman i d like to know if it has gone down over the last year
i know that all the housing organizations in the communities have been struggling with cuts that have been faced for the last number of years with the gnwt and are barely sustained above water right now
so i d like to know before i approve this as to whether or not they re are going to be taking another hit in o & m dollars to operate in the communities and here in iqaluit
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr ferris
mr ferris
i just want to clarify
the minister s correct
at the present time we re paying the municipality or the local housing authorities on the basis of the figures that came from the gnwt
there is if the main estimates are approved there is 1 million in forced growth funding for local housing operations that has not been apportioned yet to those local housing operations
and until the budget is approved we re not able to tell them to spend that money
but there was forced growth calculations done related to housing and that s included in the dollars presently within this main estimate and that would then be an adjustment of the dollars going to local housing associations
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr deputy minister for that response
i m pleased to hear that and i m sure that the associations in the communities will be too
also in here i take it that o & m funding for the regional offices and other departments and i d like to ask them how those equate to last year s numbers to the regional offices
thank you mr chairman
chairperson mr ferris
chairperson mr tootoo
thanks mr chairman
mr chairman could the minister or staff give an idea of the percentage of reduction that the regional offices i guess it s only the baffin regional office that s taking a reduction
i guess all of them
what percentages in each region the reduction over last year as a result of this transfer
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
actually the reductions should be proportionate to the number of personnel leaving in terms of going into the public works department
so it should be just proportionate to the number of people leaving
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i realize that but i asked if we could get a percentage in decreased in regional budget due to this transfer
i don t see how difficult that is to answer
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
yes we can get the information and we ll get it
i m just saying that it s not a decrease
it s just a transfer of the funds to public works in order to facilitate the transfer of technical people to public works from the housing corporation
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
so i m just going to clarify and make sure i have it straight
mr chairman the minister s stating that other than the cost related to the positions being transferred to the dpw telecommunications and technical services the regional offices are not seeing any reductions over last year s numbers
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
yes basically that s right with the exception that when the transfer occurred i guess there was about 4 or 5 vacant positions that have not been factored into the budget
chairperson interpretation
any further questions
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
may i just clarify again because i m not sure where the dollars coming in from the cmhc do they flow through this area or they show up in a different area
i d just like to ask for some clarification on that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr ferris
mr ferris
mr chairman the dollars coming in from cmhc do not show up in this section
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ferris
i have another name on my list
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you
just for further clarification mr chairman
regarding the grants and contributions
what falls under grants and contributions and how do you get grants and contributions
mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr ferris
mr ferris
mr chairman the grants and contributions is the portion of the dollars from the territorial government the government of nunavut that goes to the local housing organizations and that is the amount of the grants and contributions
the other o & m is used for travel transportation costs office supplies within the housing corporation operations
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you for that clarification and i would also like clarification on the contributions
how do you apply what contains contributions
chairperson interpretation
would anybody like to respond mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
i apologize
i didn t look at the inuktitut i believe you re talking about the grants and contributions in 7-9 and it s contributions totalling 19 million
chairperson interpretation
we re not there yet
mr puqiqnak interpretation
well it s under housing
chairperson interpretation
please use the chair mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
mr chairman i apologize
i forgot that we were at the assembly
i am here in 7-9 and i m talking about contributions in the same page
chairperson interpretation
mr puqiqnak if you could identify the number
mr puqiqnak interpretation
mr chairman i m getting very confused it s 7-9 under housing
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
i apologize
it s for homeowners assistance or some of the forms are assistance for housing
i apologize to you mr puqiqnak
you mentioned 19 million and little bit under
it s the regional housing baffin keewatin and kitikmeot which totals up 19 million and 50 thousand which would be contributed
chairperson interpretation
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman and mr minister for responding to my question
i can use an example in uqsuqtuq
there s a person who would like to build a house with his own design but he can t do that
he d like to build a house and he chose the type of housing he would like because of course when you want to be building your house you want to have it the way you like it
it creates a problem for the inuit this policy
even myself if i were going to be spending money to build a house i would want that house built the way i want to see it
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
i have heard of this concern and the department has actually talked to that person
the problem is when you want to buy an existing home the house is not under the policy but i have heard that when the people who built the house could go under article 24
it would not help out the community financially but i think well we can review this some more but under article 24 the person that they d like to buy the house from would have to be eligible under article 24
we re working on it but i think that we have to review it again
we have to find out where these houses come from if they are arctic-proof and we have to look at the policy again
chairperson interpretation
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you and i also thank the minister
looking at nunavut it s very large geographically and we are representing our ridings the communities in our ridings
well i understand exactly where you are coming from and he said that they re going to review the policy and i will be looking forward to the results of the review
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
please realize that if you have any questions please keep to the specific page number
mr kattuk
mr kattuk
mr chairman i m kind of lost i thought we were in the 7-9 33 million 243 thousand and we re talking about i believe were talking about 7-10 so i d like to go back to the topic at hand
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman in the o & m function there s salaries and wages that those costs reflect all the staff related to the nunavut housing corporation
does that include the include all the staff that are being hired in the office in arviat
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
yes
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman could the minister or his staff inform us i know during the standing committee meeting it was indicated they were having some problems filling some of those positions
they were at the time looking for controllers i was wondering if were able to find that person a key person within that division and also the status on filling the rest of the positions within that office
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
yes
on the controller he started 2 weeks ago and on the rest we re proceeding according to our schedule
we re proceeding to get employees for the department according to the schedule that we set
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
has this been addressed or is there any plans on negotiating with cmhc on the agreement as far as some changes to it or is there any plans
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
it has effected schooling health and justice issues
but cmhc money is going to gradually decrease
this social housing money will gradually decrease over the years
thank you
chairperson interpretation
did you get that mr tootoo
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i m just wondering if you can clarify those
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr ferris
mr ferris
mr chairman thank you
the minister is right that cmhc is no longer involved in social housing
that decision was made
all the agreements that are currently in place are identical in every province and territory
they simply are honouring the commitment on units that cmhc built when they were in social housing to pay us the money to maintain those units and those dollars decreased as the mortgages get paid off
with the provinces and territories and we have been involved i m on the council of deputy ministers that have responsibility for housing
our minister will be also attending the meeting hopefully in whitehorse with other ministers responsible for housing in the provinces and territories
there is an attempt in a united way by the provinces and territories to get the federal government whether it s cmhc whether it s diand whoever to look at their role in social housing
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the deputy minister said that the federal government is not responsible they are no longer in social housing
does that mean that we as the nunavut government are the ones that are responsible for social housing in nunavut
he indicated that they transferred their responsibility over to us it s something that basically if we looked at it if we addressed it it would sink us
if they re going to dump that responsibility on us there has to be some way of going back after the federal government because it was their responsibility to begin with
i don t know if we ve been transferred that responsibility
i think there is someone there at the federal level that should have responsibility for it and as the deputy minister indicated that is something that is being looked at nationally and i am glad to see that
but i still think that there should be some responsibility for that in ottawa
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation

thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes when the budget was set for housing this year is 20 million dollars shorter than the previous years
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
then the minister is saying it is half of the capital that housing had last year
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ferris
mr ferris
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the minister took the first question to mean historically what was spent and it is about 20 million less than what the gnwt historically spent on housing
chairperson interpretation
does that answer your question mr tootoo or would you like to ask another question
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i will try and clarify
what the deputy minister is saying is that there is a 10 - 15 million dollar reduction in capital from your first budget that was put forward
is that what the deputy minister is saying
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ferris
mr ferris
mr chairman just give me one second and i will give you the information
perhaps mr chairman you could go on with another question i just have to get another binder but i do have the exact number that the reduction was i just don t have it in this binder
chairperson
thank you mr ferris mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
there is none
thank you
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes i apologize in respect to the issue we just discussed
these programs are just continuing from the previous year but here at the bottom we are talking about 15 million 900 thousand that s for capital programs which will be allotted to the communities
the programs and projects that we were talking about are just continuing from the gnwt but the new money is 15 million 960 thousand
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr ferris do you have a comment
mr ferris
chairperson interpretation
does that answer your question mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
in regards to the ministers comment 15 million 960 thousand for example i had asked a question to this effect a couple of days ago about taloyoak
i asked the minister of sustainable development when you were touring the communities the 15 million dollars if you are going to be allotting some funds to taloyoak
for example they want to build a 12-plex in taloyoak will they be receiving funds from this 15 million dollars because there is none slated for taloyoak from this capital program of 15 million dollars
will taloyoak get part of this money
thank you
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes as i have stated before the ones that we just discussed are already existing programs
yes if we are going to be working with the community yes they will get some funding from that

a couple of brief questions
when the housing corporation is determining how they put retrofits in communities and looking at this one 100% of the retrofits for this year went into two communities
the baker lake housing association was taken over by the hamlet council
one of the conditions of taking it over was that they do condition ratings on all the units and there are roughly 285 public housing units
the hamlet did a condition rating and roughly 40 - 50 units were below 50%
how does the corporation or housing determine what retrofits go into a community and what condition does a house have to be in before the housing corporation will look at it before going into retrofitting
thank you
chairperson
mr ferris
mr ferris
there are various things that they would look at related to the retrofit the plumbing in the unit the electrical service and so on
i could provide a more detailed process to the member but i don t have that entire file with me this afternoon
chairperson interpretation
thank you
could you please shut off your microphone every time you are finished speaking
thank you
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman in regards to the overall reduction in the budget for housing
can the minister tell us what the impact is on maintenance reduction in maintenance costs for the lho s the local housing organizations the impact that it will have on those associations
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
thank you
the maintenance will be maintained through the o & m so it doesn t affect the maintenance
thank you
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i know the minister indicated that it is through the o & m so there shouldn t be any effect
can the minister tell me whether there is a decrease whether it is under the o & m or whatever other category for the maintenance on housing
is there a decrease this year as opposed to last year
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
no there shouldn t be because we also have to take a look at the 1 million that has to be distributed throughout the housing associations
so there shouldn t be any decrease in the o & m grants to housing associations
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
so is the minister saying if this is the case that this 1 million dollars that we have now will be used to if there is a reduction to bring these maintenance budgets back up to par
can the minister commit to that
thank you
chairperson
mr ferris
mr ferris
mr chairman thank you
that would be one of the areas that we would be looking at using the additional dollars
as was indicated earlier there were some reductions made in the past by the gnwt and we have been contacted by two or three of the local housing organizations that have identified that
the minister has committed to have our housing people review those discrepancies in their funding and see whether there is any opportunity to equalize some of that lost revenue
the figures that we are using right now simply flow out of what the gnwt was paying them as of march 31st last year
thank you
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
that s my point exactly and i appreciate the concern the minister is demonstrating towards this critical issue
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
i apologize for making inappropriate remarks at times
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i apologize too if i made any inappropriate remarks we can leave that behind us
thank you
mr chairman i would like to ask on the various housing programs the 15 million 960 thousand if the minister has that broken down by region as to what the regions will be receiving
as i understand that is the only new capital that s going to be delivered through housing this year so i would like to know if they have a regional breakdown for this year
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ferris
mr ferris
mr chairman i do have a regional breakdown just let me check with mr rafter to see whether we have a running total on the regional breakdown
i have it by program just let me see if we have it on one of these documents
chairperson interpretation
he is still looking for his document i guess
mr ferris
mr chairman sorry for the delay there are too many pieces of paper here that s why there are no trees left in this part of the country
in terms of the breakdown of the capital kitikmeot is slated to get 5 million 45 thousand kivalliq 5 million 235 thousand baffin 8 million 708 thousand
those totals will total the 19 million 60 and the only way we could arrive at the exact amount is to take those few projects that are listed on the main estimates as the carryover on the bottom lines
those figures i have just given include the main estimate sheet with the carryover amounts
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i would like to ask the minister if he could provide us with a copy of the regional breakdown of new capital for the regions
i would like to know if he could provide that for us
also i would like to know if he could provide a further breakdown through the programs that those dollars are going to be put towards
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
yes we will provide the members with a copy of that but we will also be providing the members with the capital budget and the o & m for the whole housing corporation as well
thank you
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you minister
the reason that i am asking is that i think it is important for the members to take it back home with them and say this is the housing dollars that we are going to get this year
that they have something to take home and be able to clearly indicate what new dollars they will have to deliver in their communities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
thank you
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i was going to ask a question in regards to how much capital is going to be slated for the baffin region but it has already been answered
so therefore i have no further questions as long as pond inlet will be included
chairperson interpretation
that was more of a comment
yes we ll go on housing total capital 19 million 60 thousand are you agreed
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i have to now i realize talking on that question the member from arviat raised earlier on the finances going to maintenance not to communities
just wondering i know the whole formula that s used for financing the associations
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes we will review the issues that have caused some problems so we can improve and we ll look into it
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
does that answer your question
housing total capital 19 million 60 thousand mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
we felt they were not allotting the funds evenly so i feel that the government of nunavut should contribute the funds evenly to nunavut communities
the government has stated that they would do away with the regions and they would look at the nunavut government as a whole
the previous government for example taloyoak is not included gjoa haven gets 93 thousand and kugluktuk gets 545 thousand cambridge bay 185 thousand so these communities in the kitikmeot funds that are being allotted are not equal
i don t wish to see the department contributing or allotting funds unevenly so therefore i m urging your department to contribute funds more evenly to the communities
thank you
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes in kitikmeot the 1 million 9 thousand was already existing and that just carries over
we will focus on nunavut as a whole but budget was from the previous year
thank you
chairperson
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman this is the first time that nunavut government is starting to deal with main budget estimates
gnwt had quite a huge responsibility prior to nunavut becoming real
some of their funds in the main estimates are also including gnwt previous expenditures so i did not expect to see any allotted for housing
at least now i see 19 million dollars is allotted for capital on housing i didn t even expect to see funds on housing but i m very glad to see at least you got some funds here
let s try and notice that the gnwt had a huge task with the whole territory but this is now nunavut
thank you
that was just a comment
chairperson interpretation
i m sorry let s go back to 7-9 total capital $19 million 60 thousand
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
all my questions i almost forgot to ask this one in the budget address they ve talked about nearly 20 million for social housing i m just wondering if this 19 million is the same dollars if it s not an addition
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
thank you mr tootoo
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
yes
chairperson interpretation
i have no more people on my list the total capital $ 19million 60thousand do you agree agreed
the total expenditures are $ 52 million 303 thousand are you agreed agreed
in respect to transportation the operations and maintenance the total in maintenance $ 15 million 867 thousand are you agreed agreed
open the page to 7-13 in respect to transportation the detail of capital in respect to baffin region total is $ 5million 91thousand do you agreed
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
in regards to the capital for transportation i believe this includes access roads and i know that is a priority with this department
with the gnwt it was not such a high priority because they had access over in the west by roads
i m wondering mr chairman will access roads become a high priority for the department in looking at their future capital
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
thank you mr tootoo
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
i just wondered if the member might elaborate a little more on the description of an access road
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i m just wondering does that clarify what i mean by access roads
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in respect to the capital that was set for clyde river
i would like to bring these up based on the details
i used to be a hamlet councillor and we dealt with the capital plan planning exercise while we were still under gnwt
we had an agreement with the gnwt and i will bring these to light
especially one detail just to make it clear the construction of the community break water
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu you can raise the question you have under another area
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
no it s in there i m really in the detail
chairperson interpretation
i m sorry the detail you re talking about is not in there maybe you can ask why it s not there i just want you to realize that you may know about the issue
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we wanted to get in to detailed capital for the baffin region or are we not on this issue
chairperson interpretation
yes we are but we re not talking about details not listed we re dealing with the detailed capital
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i m trying to talk about the money allotted if you would let me finish please i would really thank you very much
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu perhaps when you re not holding up the other members
maybe if you ask the questions you ll get the proper responses
please don t read the whole part
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman i was just trying to clarify an issue
when it gets within the detailed capital in the baffin region they have allotted 175 thousand dollars
i m wondering why they have cut the figure from 250 thousand that was promised by the gnwt and now it s 170 thousand
the reason why i wanted to talk about this was because it would cause a problem
the agreement we had already with the gnwt was transferred to the government of the nunavut to be dealt with and it was 250 thousand at that time
well we had an agreement for the capital plan with the gnwt but it s now 175 thousand so there s 75 thousand dollar discrepancy and that s not clear
i just wanted to ask why and thank you mr chairman for allowing me to finish
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes the 175 thousand was transferred from the gnwt
chairperson
thank you mr anawak
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes we did not get the 250 thousand we got the contract for 250 thousand dollars and it wasn t 175 thousand dollars
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu perhaps it was dealt with last year or if they proceeded with the construction last year maybe this is the left over of the capital maybe that s why he is misunderstanding it
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
no mr chairman we ve got an agreement over five years and you are supposed to honour your agreements now we ve only had our first year of operation in respect to the break water
we were supposed to follow it for five years and we had an agreement through the government
i m getting kind of sweaty here thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
thank you mr chairman
i m sorry i apologize but i had just heard that it was 175 thousand dollars
yes they requested 250 thousand but the 175 thousand was allotted this year
but i think you have to be aware that we were dealing with the main estimates
there are a lot of things on the community wish list which were not placed here when we were looking at a five-year plan for all of the communities
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman i want to know how long is the plan deferred to construct the community breakwater
i would like to understand that perhaps i could state now for the five years that we ve planned to construct the breakwater the funding has been cut
now are we to assume that we will have to deal with the community breakwater over 7 years in order to meet the rest of the construction
perhaps mr anawak the minister of transportation did state that he wanted to have a meeting with me and i m sure that will succeed
perhaps if we come to an understanding over these details and i really do want to finish and deal with the agreement of the detail capital
chairperson
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
perhaps in order to make him understand more clearly we ll get mike ferris to comment
chairperson
mr ferris
mr ferris
that like in other communities hadn t been signed off
what this money is simply doing is finishing off work that was started in the contract year last year and so in the initial budget it looked like 50 thousand needed to finish it off
there is actually more work to be done and there is 125 thousand that came as carry-over which again is only the 44 cent dollars
so there should have been twice that amount but we only got through the division of assets and liabilities 44 cent dollars
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
i will keep these brief mr chairman
because of that reason i will stop here
chairperson interpretation
mr minister mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes i am sorry but i think we might be mistaken as well because if there really was a contract in relation to that project we would have to undertake a review
perhaps i could commit that we will look into the matter and discuss the matter with the member from clyde river
chairperson interpretation
we are still in the detail of capital for the baffin region
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i don t know if the minister is aware if i could ask him two years ago there was a harbour study done here in iqaluit
i would like to ask for a commitment from the minister if he would review that study and take a look at some of the things that were identified in there for future possible capital projects within this department
thank you
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes we know that the tidal flats are very large and i am aware of that study
we will look into it
we will do a thorough review
thank you
chairperson interpretation
i no longer have anybody on my list
in respect to the detailed capital the baffin total is 5 million 91 thousand are you agreed
the keewatin region the keewatin total is 475 thousand
agreed
some members
agreed
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman being that we are a new government now and looking at doing things differently i think in the past in the old system there wasn t a lot of attention paid to the eastern arctic
there was a lot of time and effort and dollars spent in the western arctic
mr chairman i wonder if the minister would be prepared to commit to putting together a committee of this house to review transportation in general
we could do that together as one committee
if the minister could speak to that briefly i would appreciate it
thank you
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak
i am pretty sure that there are some areas where we can really improve the transportation industry by using the expertise of the people up here who know the north
so yes i will make that commitment to look at some form of a committee or a task force utilizing the members from the house
chairperson interpretation
i no longer have anybody on the list
the detail of capital the keewatin total is 475 thousand

some members
agreed
chairperson interpretation
minister anawak
just a small comment
i think you may notice that we had already agreed to the regional breakdowns but there is a 1 dollar discrepancy i just wanted you to notice that
hon jack anawak interpretation
i believe the finance minister made that mistake
we are not to blame
chairperson interpretation
maybe he took off yes there is a slight discrepancy here and it is 1 thousand dollars it is 5 million 870 thousand dollars and the other total is 5 million 871 thousand
we do not have the finance minister present how are we to proceed here
minister mr anawak
hon jack anawak
yes perhaps one was rounded off to 870 thousand and the other added up to 71 so we will blame the finance minister for this
chairperson interpretation
perhaps the finance minister could correct that discrepancy
the figure in 7 - 12 and the figure in 7 - 14 have a slight 1 thousand dollar discrepancy
finance minister mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you
chairperson interpretation
the minister of finance has stated that this can be corrected

chairperson interpretation
thank you for coming back
following through with our agenda we are going to deal with culture language elders & youth
we have the minister of culture language elders & youth
we can begin with this department
minister havioyak
hon donald havioyak
thank you mr chairperson
the department of culture language elders & youth is a new department within the nunavut government
the creation of this department was recommended by the nunavut implementation commission in its footprints ii report
our mandate and services are unique and found nowhere else in canada or for that matter in the world
the department is responsible for youth elders and women s issues providing a vital link between the people and the government
language translation and interpretation services for the nunavut government are one of our key central department roles
our central department roles include managing the territorial archives and ensuring government is compliant with the archives act and the official languages act
currently the department is staffed by just over 90% inuit members which exceeds the government of nunavut inuit employment target and we are very proud of this achievement to date
our department has maximized its decentralized plan with only the deputy minister s office and the policy and planning unit located in iqaluit
our culture elders & youth division is headquartered in igloolik and our language division is headquartered in iqaluktuuttiaq cambridge bay
i am sure you will agree that the presence of our department will have a positive impact on the economic status of these two communities
it will also be easier for the local people to visit and discuss their concerns with the officials staffed by senior personnel
the department of culture language elders & youth budget is 6 million 200 thousand dollars which includes resources to look after the status of women portfolio
the budget of the department includes the funding for many language services that have government wide applications as well as funding support in the form of grants and contributions to the nunavut public
at present the dept is tasked with distributing just over 2 million 400 thousand dollars in grants and contributions to individuals organizations and local governments
the budget of the department is organized into five categories
the deputy ministers office policy/finance unit women s issues language bureau and the culture elders and youth division
the deputy minister s office is responsible for the overall management of the department and has a recommended budget of 285 thousand 600 dollars
the policy/finance unit is responsible for the analysis of all departmental policies and provides policy planning and financial advice and services to the departments senior managers
this unit has a budget of 357 thousand 400 dollars
the status of women s portfolio provides senior management with advice and guidance regarding women s issues in nunavut
the budget of this unit is 637 thousand 200 dollars
the language bureau is tasked to provide all government departments with translation and interpretative services as requested
we are also developing the nunavut government s language policy
they are also responsible for the administration of the official languages act and make recommendations on the telecommunications and radio/tv activities within smaller communities
the budget of this bureau is 2 million 88 thousand 600 dollars
the culture elders & youth division is responsible for managing the cultural heritage and artistic health of the territory
the division is the key link between government and nunavut s youth elders and artists
the division is also responsible for providing direction and planning on issues facing the conservation and protection of nunavut s heritage and culture
we are working to incorporate inuit qaujimajituqangit inuit traditional knowledge into the government of nunavut
the implementation of iq is being done with our nunavut partners mainly the nunavut social development council
soon we will be meeting with all the cabinet members to promote iq in the government civil service
the division co-ordinates the territory s archaeology activities archaeology-permitting process historical records and grants authority of official place names and/or titles
the division is home for the nunavut archives and it administers the archives act
the budget for this division is 2 million 892 thousand 900 dollars
the formation of the nunavut arts council is continued from the former nwt arts council
its role will be to recommend to the minister of culture language elders & youth on issues relating to cultural activities and artistic needs of nunavut
it s major responsibility will be to make sure that the arts community has a voice in promoting nunavut s talented population in cultural issues such as singing story-telling theatrical groups and others
the role mandate and tasks given to the department of culture language elders & youth is vast and diverse
it is a new mandate that is maturing and developing daily and which deals with complex issues and matters of culture heritage and language
each day our department faces new challenges and hurdles in developing staffing and leading this new government department
we have been tasked to ensure that the government complies with its legal obligations under the archives act yet we have no facility to accomplish this
nor do we have the capital dollars to build or plan this required facility
we are tasked to ensure our heritage art artifacts and significant pieces of the past are well documented and stored in nunavut for the use and pleasure of all people
however we have no facility or capital dollars to build a heritage centre to store the people of nunavut s art and artifacts
our past is kindly stored mr chairperson by the government of the nwt in yellowknife
not available for our people to see not available for our youth to learn from not available for our elders to teach with
i am sure all members here today would agree that we gain nothing as a government by keeping the precious work of our ancestors and elders out of reach of our people
i would also like to inform all of you that our department has been working closely with nunavut tunngavik inc and the inuit heritage trust to explore ideas dealing with a nunavut heritage centre
our goals are clear mr chairperson however so are our limitations
i would like to conclude my comments by echoing the findings issued this week by the standing committee that recently reviewed our mandate business plan and budget
we clearly do not have the financial resources to adequately address or accomplish the tasks that have been given to us
we look for the support of our members and their advice in helping us to map out new ways to do our business and complete our goals
thank you
chairperson interpretation
minister havioyak would you like to ask your staff to come to the witness table
hon donald havioyak interpretation
yes i will be asking my deputy minister peter irniq and also mark bain our director of finance please come to the table
chairperson interpretation
welcome mr irniq and mr bain
right now we will begin
mr alakannuark do you have any comments do you want to make any comments
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i will be reading this document on culture language elders & youth
mr donald havioyak is the minister for this department
we met on this department on april 30th 1999 and he talked about the business plan
there were a number of questions that were asked at that time for this new department
this is a very important department
members do have a concern and they spent a number of days on this department to make sure there is enough funding for this
the department of culture language elders & youth has less than 6 million dollars
contributions are 2 9 million no interpretation our concern is where the funding is coming from and also for the capital funding and we did not see any in 99/2000 the department has no funding for capital projects
this department plays a key role in the preservation and revitalization of inuktitut and inuinnaqtun language in nunavut as well as providing translation services for the entire government
the minister advised us that french and inuit language services agreements are being
the cabinet has publicly stated that it will function in inuktitut and the minister has stated to us that he will inform all departments that inuktitut and inuinnaqtun should be used in all government meetings and written materials
members welcome this direction however it is unclear how much of the departments funding is allocated to these tasks particularly translation and interpretation services
it seems to the members that the departments are scrambling for translation services and there is no clear direction as to who is co-ordinating these services and also how they will be used
members have no sense as to whether the budget allocated for these services is sufficient but fear it is not
the committee was advised that there are four official languages in nunavut inuktitut inuinnaqtun english and french
members asked if the department is planning to bring forward amendments to the official languages act in this regard
there are currently eight official languages in the gnwt act which nunavut has inherited and we are advised that the staff is looking at this
no mention was made of the official languages commissioner in this regard
members had a good discussion with the minister regarding dialects and everyone agrees that we want to preserve the 26 dialects across nunavut
members also asked about language training
members are concerned about inuit who have to learn or regain their inuktitut whether they work for government or are in communities as well as non-inuit members and staff of the government of nunavut
it was noted that human resources and culture language elders & youth staff would develop a training course in inuktitut and french
as a general observation the standing committee is concerned that this work seems to be at such an early stage of development
it seems unclear from our discussions whether cabinet or the department of culture language elders & youth have to take leadership on these issues
recommendation
that as a first priority the government of nunavut develop a language policy which clearly states which government information will be translated or interpreted and how these translation and interpreting services are co-ordinated and accessed
that the department of culture language elders & youth develop a clear plan of action to implement this policy
that the government of nunavut develop a comprehensive language training program for inuktitut
nunavut arts council
members were advised that the department of culture language elders & youth is planning to establish a nunavut arts council and that appointments will be made in three weeks
this body will have 136 thousand dollars for grants 43 thousand for the baffin 25 thousand for the keewatin and 18 thousand dollars for the kitikmeot
members look forward to hearing more about these plans as soon as the information is available
nunavut territorial archives and heritage
the department of culture language elders & youth has been tasked to operate the nunavut territorial archives and oversee the archaeological activities in nunavut
members were advised that there is no archival facility in nunavut
as this is legally required in order to store government papers members were curious as to why no capital plans were presented for this needed facility and what the plans are for the coming year
members were advised that the department will be looking to develop a heritage facility in nunavut
members expressed a desire to see artifacts and cultural heritage items such as photographs returned to their own communities as well
members know that it may not be necessary to create dedicated heritage buildings in every community
appropriate display cases could be established in existing buildings such as schools airports hamlet offices elders centres and so on
it was further noted that the nunavut land claims agreement and the inuit heritage trust also play a role in repatriating cultural items to nunavut
members welcomed an idea in the draft business plan for encouraging community based inuit cultural/heritage groups to work on these types of projects and look forward to hearing the departments progress on these issues
recommendation
inuit qaujimajituqangit iq
as noted above all departments stated a commitment to make inuit qaujimajituqangit the foundation of the new government of nunavut
but as members noted earlier no department has articulated what this means
elders and youth
as noted above all departments stated a commitment to involve elders more in their policy development and programs
most important is to determine the partnerships that will provide support to the elders councils in each community so that they can participate fully in policy development and program delivery
the minister of education spoke to our committee about the need to create and store tapes videos and written transcripts of interviews of elders regarding their traditional knowledge
members are concerned that our elders won t always be with us and we need to do this right away
members also know of situations where irreplaceable materials have been lost or destroyed by fire
the committee was advised that the department was hoping to hire staff in the near future for senior youth advisor and elders advisor
members look forward to hearing more about the departments plans for elders and youth once these people have joined the department
recommendation
status of women
it was noted that in the gnwt this funding was given to the status of women council the native women s association of the nwt and a grants program to community women s groups
no explanation was given during the meeting and the committee looks forward to receiving this information
as this will be an important organization to represent women from across nunavut members look forward to hearing about these options as soon as they are ready for consideration
recommendation
that the department of culture language elders & youth develop an options paper for a new status of women s council in nunavut for presentation at the standing committee

speakers ruling
speaker interpretation
before we start i would like to deal with a point of order made by ms thompson yesterday
i will make a ruling at this time before we go to oral questions
ms thompson s point of order was in regards to comments made by the nattilik member of the assembly on may 27 1999
it is ruled out of order
after we did the review of yesterday s comments in hansard i have to rule that there was no point of order
the nattilik member of the assembly made comments about several different departments
it did not break house rules
it was an opinion
the minister and the member had different opinions about the content of the members statement
i would like to say at this point that we must watch what we are saying in this house

ministers statement 23 - 1 2 new inuit rcmp recruits
hon jack anawak
thank you mr speaker
the new rcmp division for nunavut is known as v division
chief superintendent chris bothe is the commanding officer for v division
he has been in iqaluit since last august and has set up the new divisional headquarters
he has also visited many communities for meetings with hamlet councils along with nunavut officials
i am pleased to tell you that chief superintendent bothe is taking very seriously the issue of recruiting inuit members into the rcmp
he recognizes the importance of having officers in our communities who know our language and our people
in order to accomplish this goal the rcmp are actively trying to recruit inuit members into the force
so far this has been successful
the first all inuit troop of eight recruits is now at the rcmp depot in regina for training
they are scheduled to graduate in october and then will be posted to nunavut detachments as full-fledged rcmp officers
the inuit recruits currently training in regina are
moses aupaluktuq from baker lake
josephe bain pitsi koochiajuk and ben williams from iqaluit
andrew nakashuk from pangnirtung
eric ootovak and kevin sadlunik from pond inlet and
richard tatty from arviat
this is a new approach to training inuit recruits
the fact they form a group of their own means that they will be able to support each other through the rigorous training program in regina
as we know it is often difficult for our young people to leave their home communities to go to cities in the south
but by staying together through their training these recruits will be more likely to succeed
i welcome this new direction being taken by chief superintendent bothe and v division
nunavut communities may soon begin to see a major improvement in their policing service thanks to the vision of the rcmp and the inuit recruits who have made the commitment to go to regina

canadian environment week and clean air day
hon peter kilabuk
mr speaker this will be the first environment week to be celebrated since nunavut became a territory on april 1 1999 and i plan to ensure that it continues every year hereafter
mr speaker we cannot ever forget the importance of our people maintaining strong ties to our environment
our respect for the land the air we breathe and all living things defines us as a people it shapes our relationships with each other and compels us to return continuously to sources of our collective inuit traditional knowledge
inuit qaujimajatuqangit
mr speaker we are here today because our ancestors through the generations cared for our land
mr speaker when i sit with the environment ministers i will be very proud to describe the relationship of our people to the land and the knowledge that our ancestors have passed on to us
during environment week i want to recognize the contribution of our ancestors in ensuring future generations could also live on our land and from our animals
i will also look to our people to continue this very important responsibility
i call upon my colleagues in this assembly mayors community leaders leaders of community organizations and nunavummiut to give thought to the responsibility toward the environment we have been entrusted with during our lives
i am asking you to make a contribution today to the care of our environment
mr speaker this year the first year of our new territory i urge colleagues to celebrate the beauty of nunavut and its clean air and water
i also urge colleagues to identify those environmental issues that urgently need our attention and to urge all our citizens to take action
some of the things that we can do could include
reduce our energy consumption
turn off our lights when they are not needed
reduce our water consumption
use less water with your bath and showers
keep our communities clean
organize a clean up as the snow melts
keep our land clean
bring back everything you take out on the land and bring back the garbage of others you may find
keep our lakes and ocean clean
bring back your garbage from boating trips
mr speaker there is so much that we have to be proud of this year

appreciation to nurses
mr puqiqnak interpretation
i would like to thank the nurses in our community not only in our community but all the nurses in all the nunavut communities
they worked tirelessly and i believe that our communities should thank the nurses
they are always readily available to help the people in our communities
i do know that the nurses are always available
i believe that it is up to us to thank them for all the hard work that they do in the communities and for working in the evenings and in the middle of the night
due to the shortage of nurses they have to work all day and then be on call and be available all night
i would like to thank the nurses for their contributions to the communities

gun control legislation and nti
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today to speak on an issue of this governments commitment to work jointly with the land claims organization in respect to the matter of the federal gun control legislation
mr speaker nti has taken a firm position in the path of gun control in their position paper on bill c-68 an act respecting firearms and other weapons
it is their position that the effect of the bill which is now the federal gun control legislation
we have been speaking about whether or not this will prevent the inuit of nunavut through the requirement of licence registration certificates and fees from exercising their aboriginal and treaty harvesting rights
mr speaker they also specify that section 5 7 42 of the agreement protects an inuk s right to use any type method or technology to harvest
mr speaker i look forward to hearing from the government of nunavut their position in respect to the arguments put forward by nti
i would also hope that the government of nunavut is consulting closely with nti in consideration on whether to intervene and what future positions they might take with respect to the gun control legislation

mla s working in harmony
hon jack anawak
thank you
i know that we are going to be working very hard on many government issues
since we are going to be sitting here for the next four years the members of the legislative assembly will have to support each other during the hard times
also we will have to realize at all times that we must support all people
we are well aware that the nunavut government is a public government that represents all the people of nunavut
we have to keep this in mind whether you are a minister or a regular member of the legislative assembly
at times as mla s there will be debates between the ministers and members
also we have to realize and keep in mind that if we hurt one of our colleagues then we are also going to be hurting the people of nunavut
we have to realize that we are representing the people out there
if we mistreat one person then we are hurting the rest of the nunavut population

arctic college board of governors
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question for the minister responsible for education and it s a follow up to the issue that my colleague raised from sanikiluaq
in reference to the arctic college board of governors
i can rephrase the question
will the minister consider abolishing these boards given the fact that we re right in the midst of finalizing the abolishment of the education board which has a similar function
thank you
mr speaker interpretation
mr o brien
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
mr speaker i m not clear about the meaning of his question
i was listening to the interpretation
i wonder if he could repeat his question
mr speaker interpretation
can you repeat your question mr o brien

question 120 - 1 2
future of workers compensation board
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question today is to the minister responsible for the worker s compensation board
mr speaker i believe currently we have an agreement with the government of the northwest territories to share the worker s compensation board until at least the year 2003
i know this government is in its infancy and we re only 2 months into the mandate but we re here
we have a nunavut government and we re up and running
would the minister consider re-evaluating our agreement with the gnwt and maybe fast-tracking setting up or splitting the current arrangement that we have with the gnwt
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean
minister responsible for the worker s compensation board mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the member is correct
i believe there is a joint management agreement with the gnwt in respect to the management of the wcb that does run i believe up to the year 2003
but there also at the same time is a clause in there that allows the decision to be made prior to december 31st of 2000 in respect to what s going to happen to the wcb
one of the options of course is whether or not to pursue establishing a separate wcb for nunavut
it is one of the issues that we will be looking at and review it in consultation with all members and other interests in this area mr speaker
thank you
mr speaker interpretation
thank you mr ng
oral question mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
i think i m correct in my assumption that the minister is going to re-evaluate our current agreement on the wcb and look at setting up our own worker s compensation in nunavut as soon as possible
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
i believe that was more of a statement than a question but yes it is an issue that obviously will have to be looked at quite seriously
we have to recognize that the wcb is an independent board
it s funded by employers who provide through premiums the operating funds for the wcb

thank you for answering my question of yesterday
i have another question to the minister of sustainable development
in his letter we were thinking about a broader perspective on this building
i wonder if he looked at the whole thing
speaker interpretation
minister for sustainable development mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i was just clarifying that i have received this letter and i also sent a copy to the minister of public works

if you need further information the co-op in gjoa haven in my constituency they have proposed that this building become an office retail complex
so if you need further information i would be happy to provide you with more information and there s been a lot of correspondence about that
maybe the minister of public works needs more information
that s why i m asking about this to the ministers

mr speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister of transportation mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you speaker
we have been talking about establishing a highway link to nunavut and some of the reviewing or surveying that s been done
what the study has done so far is only a feasibility study to construct the highway from manitoba to nunavut through keewatin
i don t think we re going to know in the near future what we re actually going to be doing
we are working with the premier and the premier is working very hard on this issue but we re unable to say at this time as to when we will proceed with the project
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you speaker
mr speaker the highway that is being proposed is it going to be for cars
what kind of traffic is going to be travelling in the highway
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
we don t know that yet but whenever we re talking about a highway we re talking about vehicle traffic
we have to determine what kind of construction we would be looking at and we can t say that at this time
when we re talking about a highway for vehicle traffic like trucks we would have to do a study first on what kind of highway we would want and whether it would be for just passenger vehicles or heavy trucks
we know that this is going to be a very expensive undertaking but now that we have nunavut this is one of our first priorities to link ourselves with the rest of canada
speaker interpretation

minister responsible for community governments mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes thank you
i know that you re concerned about timing on this issue
i think we can respond ahead of the sea-lift i think right now the reason that it s going slowly is that once the decision for this needs to be identified by the residents of kimmirut
it has to be inspected by the department of health
health issues have to be addressed first
i know that there s a need to work on these issues because the materials would have to come in the sealift and we need to make those orders as soon as possible
i have had a discussion with the minister of health and i conveyed to him that we need to work on this right away
we will continue to treat this as an urgent matter and once hurdles have been jumped i think that we would have time to get the materials by sealift to kimmirut on time

thank you mr anawak

oral questions mr o brien
question 127 - 1 2 gun bill court challenge
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is referring to the gun bill but this is not a direct question regarding the actual court case
my question to the minister of justice
mr speaker it s my understanding when the government of the northwest territories decided to join in this court case it did not wish to have any part of the administration of the act for the federal government
mr speaker we have a number of wildlife officers that are very knowledgeable very well connected to various hta s and organizations individuals tourist that come in to the communities and hunt
as a result he can t hunt he can t bring food home
so given that fact we still have to deal in some way that there has to be some sort of certification registration being done
my question is will the minister look at having his individuals that work in wildlife if they can assist in the paper work at least in the mean time we have something in place to assist the local hunters
thank you
speaker
qujannamiik mr o brien
that question was directed to minister of justice mr anawak

question 2 - 1 2 contract for medical boarding home services keewatin health and social services board and t c
enterprises
hon ed picco
qujannamiik oqaqtii
oqaqtii i have a return to written question for all 23 questions asked by mr mclean on may 20th concerning the medical and boarding facilities in winnipeg
the terms of reference for the request for proposals were issued by the keewatin regional health and social services board as attached in schedule a
supplementary documents provided to those persons who submitted proposals are attached to appendix b
these are titled daily occupancy statistics information
this report contains information on the number of nights and days for fiscal years for 1995- 96 fiscal year to 1998-99 and the number of day s for the same period
the new contract between the keewatin health and social services board and tc enterprises has not been finalized yet
the terms included in that contract will be similar to terms contained in the request for proposals
the dollar amount of the contract on an annual basis is 1 million 240 thousand 5 hundred and 22
over the life of the contract july 1st 1999 to march 31st 2002 this amounts to a total contract price of 3 million 579 thousand and 52
the copy of criteria used to evaluate the proposals is attached as appendix c
these specific criteria were weighted in a final evaluation of the proposal mr speaker as indicated in appendix c that we have attached
no other information was considered in the evaluation any of the proposals
the review and the evaluation of the proposals were conducted on april 14th 1999 in rankin inlet
the contract to be awarded to tc enterprises is an administrative matter and would not be voted on by the keewatin health and social services board
no vote was held on this matter nor will there be any vote on this issue
before proceeding to a review of the proposals all members of the review and evaluation committee signed a declaration of confidentiality in which they all did declare their participation did not constitute a conflict of interest
mr speaker before proceeding to our review of a proposal all members of the review and evaluation committees sign a declaration of confidentiality in which they declare their participation does not constitute a conflict of interest
the keewatin health and social services board did not vote on this matter the contract is not yet signed however it will be signed by the chief executive officer of the keewatin health and social services board
the contract has not yet been signed on behalf of tc enterprises
community organizations and individuals were not consulted in respect to their preference or issues of concern
no
mr speaker no the criteria established before the review was used by the review committee and determined the out come of the proposal
mr speaker the answer is no
the answer is no
the term of the contract will be from july 1st 1999 to march 31st 2002
mr speaker i think it s important to note that to understand the answers i guess the member would have to be following along with the questions originally asked and how we are responding
tc enterprises is operated by mr anthony chang president of tc enterprises
he is assisted by ellen mcdonald grundy vice president of tc enterprises and the operation of the winnipeg boarding facility mr speaker is a joint venture with partners lorne and sally kusugak of rankin inlet
mr speaker the resident manager of the boarding facility in winnipeg will be ms barbara e
clarke
the board s evaluation team is charged with determining which of the proposals provided the best value
mr speaker i am confident that we achieved the correct result
the team had to weigh many factors including the cost to the taxpayers quality service and to be provided in relation to article 24
our review of this matter confirms that the evaluation met these objectives

chairperson interpretation
i hope you had a great lunch
we are on committee of the whole and we do have a quorum
yesterday we started with the department of culture language and elders and youth and we will continue on with it this afternoon
i would like to ask the minister if he could go to the witness table
chairperson interpretation
mr minister donald havioyak you may bring in your officials
i would like to welcome you
i would like to welcome mr donald havioyak and his officials
i would like to acknowledge his officials and his deputy minister peter irniq and their financial controller mr bain
i apologize for not pronouncing it well
mr bain
if you didn t smile to each other this morning i want you to greet each other with a smile
>>laughter
but anyhow we ll start off
thank you for coming in and now we re on general comments to his department
we are now on general comments
mr alakannuark had read the committee report yesterday and the minister responsible for this department had made his opening comments so we are now on general comments
deputy minister peter irniq
mr irniq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
our departments name in inuktitut is culture language elders and youth
thank you
chairperson interpretation
i will try and pronounce the department in inuktitut well
the department of culture language elders and youth
at this time we are on general comments
are there any general comments
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
seems like you re focusing more on these two issues according to the way i read the opening comments
but on our elders at this time
how can we get more job opportunities to the elders
how can we make the employment opportunities more available to the elders
such as teaching inuktitut language and culture i have worked on it for seven years and i know how it goes i m quite experienced in this issue where elders and youth work together
i realize that once elders and youth got together i realized that this was very important
i feel that i m looking at the amount of budget 6 million i know it s inadequate for the whole of nunavut
we have also utilized the elders within the school curriculum
letting them tell stories and legends and we have been documenting the oral legends then that s when i realized this issue is very very important to us perhaps you could focus you re work on these issue too
i feel that if we could include all these issues within nunavut government
with the previous government of gnwt did not really focus on culture
so i feel that the nunavut government should involve the culture rather than just focusing on artifacts and we should be focusing on cultural education
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr irniq
did you want to make a comment to that effect
mr irniq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
your comments are very true and heart warming
we will utilize the elders and we will be continuing to create opportunities for them to work at the school perhaps at the learning centres
we will be trying to get the elders to help the school children on culture and stories
we will have them teach the young people how to make natural clothing
we want to recognize those elders that have worked so hard on our behalf
and did i answer your question
maybe i answered your question
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes you answered me appropriately and i want to hear more about that because i ve been working on this issue and we also have to realize yes it s a fact
when you said that the elders have been very useful and at times we let them do volunteer work for us in the past
looking at the school curriculum that has been used in the past such as sometimes the school system has been using the elders just to obtain their knowledge when it was with the previous gnwt
we don t want to see that happen again
we wish to see the elders being paid under salary and i think that they should be employed under salary and perhaps by working together it can happen
however looking at nunavut as a whole their budget is quite small for nunavut government
nunavut communities it s only 6 million dollars
if this funding could be evenly distributed to all the communities i would be very happy
i m very glad that you had responded to me well
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr minister havioyak please use the chairman
mr havioyak hon donald havioyak
i m sorry mr chairman i forgot about you
today mr irniq can add further to that what our department is doing so you have an idea exactly what we are doing
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr irniq
mr irniq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes your question is a very good question and it s very good to hear that kind of a question being posed
our mandate was to help the department help the communities so that we could teach the culture and tradition in the schools
from the beginning from kindergarten to grade 12
we have been planning that
well actually the education and our department have been planning to teach inuktitut curriculum from kindergarten to grade 12
just for example mr chairman we would like to utilize the elders within our department more and we keep on saying that the government staff
we would like see inuit on government staff more and we keep talking about hiring inuit more and that s our goal too
but we will require your support and assistance with the interested departments and we have to work with elders
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you deputy minister peter
we re on general comments
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
i apologize for being the only person to speak to this issue but i have been working very hard on this issue
the writing system whether it is in english or inuktitut i have tried to find out more about the writing system by using the students even we are using inuktitut culture
when we are using inuktitut culture and when we teach them in alphabets its not too good because some of the students have used syllabic system and we let the students use whatever writing system they d like to use
but the students mainly write down their material in english when they are being taught inuktitut culture
i think it was last year i worked with 35 students during the summer break and i was quite very proud of the students at that time because the small children as they are growing up
i realised that they were getting very excited about seeing new things in their culture and i felt that it touched me that s when i realized its very important
the inuktitut instructors in the schools they have to make their own school curriculum and that s how they do it right now
the teachers need more support in developing school curricula
perhaps using that new document that was brought up could be utilized by your department and by the department of education
they should work together and work on this
i just wanted to point that out mr chairman and thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank mr iqaqrialu
mr minister
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you
do you have the records
the item that we re going to be using in schools for teaching young children
i think we will be working on that shortly and we want to teach the young people how to read and write in their language
so we will be preparing curriculum s for the schools
whether we teach them how to hunt and trap maybe
maybe work with hta s on teaching the young people on the land programs and that
chairperson interpretation
you have any other comments here
mr irniq will add further to those comments
thank you mr havioyak
deputy minister irniq
mr irniq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
while we re working towards those goals and setting up curricula for the students and teach them the inuit traditions and culture we are going to be showing these children
i know that inuuqatigiit was talked about in this house which is a curriculum that was set by the divisional board and it s already been implemented
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman for those responses
one thing that we also have to think about because through experience i have seen how inuit and english languages are taught in school
if you re using two languages in one house it deteriorates the language be it either inuktitut or english
so i would very strongly suggest that everything be taught in inuktitut as a language of instruction in the schools or you re going to be teaching students
if you re going to be teaching english only instruction or inuktitut only instruction there has to be a place for both languages
i m sure that its not going to be implemented right away but saying that if you teach using two languages of instruction it slows down the learning process of the students
that s how i see it
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
we have department of culture language elders and youth here and mr iqaqrialu s comments i think are more appropriate if they were directed at the minister of education
none-the-less if you want to make further comments
minister donald havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation
chairperson interpretation
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to ask the question regarding elders
while we keep hearing that the department of education and social services want to be more people friendly
my question to this department is how close are you going to be to the elders
if there s something in between your department and inuit cultural institute
my question mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
mr minister havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation
i apologize mr chairperson
i did not quite understand the actual question
maybe you should say it again please
chairperson interpretation
did you want to clarify your question
i believe that you used two languages
you were speaking in inuktitut could you clarify your points please mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
that s why i keep asking for my own interpreter
my question is how close are you to the inuit cultural institute
for example is there such a structure that the inuit cultural institute has to use in order to speak to your department or did they have to go through somebody before they reach your department
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
like you said you needed your own interpreter
the deputy minister will be making a response to mr kattuk mr irniq
mr irniq interpretation
thank you mr chairman and the members thank you
in response to your question i believe i got your question
you were talking about how close the working relationship is going to be between our departments and the elders
within our department in the nunavut government we want to work very closely together with all the elders in the nunavut area
we would also like to use the organizations that are set up specifically for the elders to work closely with them
our department affects all communities in the nunavut area when it comes to the issue of elders
that s for all the the elders in our communities
thank you mr deputy minister
chairperson interpretation
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
i ll try again
some of the communities have very well established elder s societies and there are some who don t
is there a guideline that the elder s society will need to use in order set up a society if there is not one established in their community
chairperson
mr irniq
mr irniq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i believe i got your question
we were asked to help our elders
at the time we were with the nunavut implementation commission we were told to set up a system with the elders and the youth in the nic days
now that we have a nunavut government we have to help our elders in all ways that we can that is the direction we were given when we were setting up the nunavut government
there is no money available but in cambridge bay when the elders and youth had a meeting there was a motion that dealt with setting up a council
that was in cambridge bay
that is the direction we would use after consideration and review by the nunavut government
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
this is not a question but more of a comment
a lot of our elders have passed away and when they pass they take the oral tradition and culture with them
possibly your department should gather the inuit qaujimajatuqangit as soon as possible by talking to the elders and gathering that information as soon as possible
the elders have all this valuable knowledge that they take with them when they pass away
their knowledge of the environment the animals and each individual has their own knowledge and i believe that we have to gather that information as soon as possible
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
that didn t sound like a question but either the minister or the deputy minister may respond if you wish
mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes we are quite aware of this
because our history is verbal only when our elders pass away we lose this knowledge
right now we have staff in igloolik who are starting to use the traditional knowledge of inuit and the staff will be visiting elders in the community of igloolik
we all know that the youth are losing their culture and we are going to revive this
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i have another question regarding the rankin inlet inuit cultural institute
what is happening with that now
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
deputy minister irniq
mr irniq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i believe that you are talking about the inuit cultural institute
yes
we cannot respond to your question as their agreement was that they get contributions from the federal government and the gnwt has several agreements in regards to archives and heritage which are housed at the yellowknife museum
the nunavut government has not signed any of these agreements so at this point i cannot respond to your question
chairperson interpretation
thank you
today it has been raining and i hear thunder out there
there s a question and before that i would like mr iqaqrialu to come to the chair
chairperson mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
while i am sitting here i would like to see no smiles
we are into general questions for culture language elders & youth
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
my question is for clarification on the issue of elders
the elders in the communities in the nattilik region the keewatin and in the baffin there are different inuit tribes
in respect to the elders how are you going to address this
that is my question mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
either the minister or the deputy may respond
mr irniq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i will try to answer you although it will be a short response
in respect of the elders in nunavut
we have always stated that without our elders we would not be here today
the elders are our foundation as inuit
therefore we are trying to develop a policy that is based on elders wishes we want to hand them more responsibility based on our understanding of how the government was structured
the elders in nunavut we want to ensure that they are part of our resources
we keep citing the example of the conference in cambridge bay i believe in 1988 which was a good first step for both the elders and the youth
as we are going towards our future wherever that may be we have to co-operate in our land and we have to utilize the elders knowledge in any way possible
so their traditional knowledge about culture language and our identity are the reason we need to do that
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you peter
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
please state my name properly it is not alakannuark it is alakannuark
this is more of a comment
if this knowledge was recorded for posterity the inuit people and the future generations can learn that
that is the way it is and i feel strongly that it is important that it is being worked on
but in this day and age our way of living from the old days because there are a lot of things now that are vastly different from the old days from the way i grew up
sometime when we hear this it touches me because when i was a young person i felt the elders wisdom and that affects me all the time
the elders have valuable knowledge in all aspects of the inuit culture but i also know that as an elder either an elder has forgotten or the elder does not know something that a younger person does know
for example a younger person would operate in written words but the elder would not know this as well because they operated in an oral tradition
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
i think i stated it properly this time
mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i understand his comments
i want to remind you that we will not be working on this alone we have to work together and also with different organizations such as nti so that different organizations can help us
the nunavut social development council the inuit heritage trust we have to use all of the available organizations to see how we are going to operate as a government
if we work together we can achieve these goals
thank you
chairperson interpretation
sorry that was my fault
thank you for providing the proper response mr havioyak
mr puqiqnak
i am sorry if i mispronounced your name as well that does not hurt to have your name mispronounced
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i am not sure where to start from but perhaps maybe i can give some background
culture language elders & youth when we are dealing with culture younger people have to grab that knowledge i think that should be the goal of culture language elders & youth
i am not sure how but our ancestors are our history and our heritage and we have stemmed from them
we have touched part of that traditional lifestyle
for example people of my age i am around 50 s we caught part of that traditional lifestyle
i used to be very shy to go into a house which did not have lice because at that time we used to have a lot of lice and i used to be embarrassed about that
in this day and age i am happy to say that if it had not been for our heritage we would not be here
they lived off the land and we smelled like the land because we were inuumarik
for example the animals had different tastes and smells and we did as well the hunters would have lice and so would the children
i am sure we can pass down our knowledge but how can we make them understand because they never lived that lifestyle
they know where their historical roots are but they never experienced the lifestyle as we did
it is too far in the past already and they never caught any part of it
although that is the situation today i am sure that there are bridges we can build to bridge the gap
if we get more funding and if we could be assisted in other means what process could we use to make them understand
just to cite an example i am not really looking at funding but this is one of my highest priorities dealing with elders and youth
as inuit in the different communities we have our distinct dialects as when the member from clyde river was stating he would like to have his own interpreter
i am not sure whether you have thought about these issues
when i look at 8-7 mr chairman we are talking about grants and contributions
if you are going to be raising the funding because our goal is to strengthen our language and our culture if we are trying to have our traditional language promoted 86 thousand dollars is very limited funds
if the nunavut government could add more to the amount i am not sure whether you have thought of that either to put more funding into the grants
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
in respect to your historical comments those of us who had to live a traditional life we did smell like the land because we came from that that s the truth
which of you would like to respond
mr irniq
mr irniq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in response to the 86 thousand dollars which are the grants for cultural enhancements i understood exactly what the member for nattilik was referring to
the promotion and protection for cultural enhancement oral traditions and cultural organizations
in respect to cultural enhancements there are different ways of writing
for example in our main estimates there are differences some of them are crossovers from the gnwt and they were transferred and that is why they are there
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irniq
i think we have to be aware of our agenda we will reach the main estimates later and we will reach those pages but perhaps for now we can focus on general comments
mr puqiqnak you are welcome to comment further
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i believe that last week i made comments to the house in respect to the museum
i know at this time we want to see these types of things but again the lack of financial resources has been an obstacle
across the atlantic there are some artifacts in foreign countries
how can we get a museum to repatriate our cultural items
for example around 1962 to 1966 there used to be researchers in our area about 110 miles west i grew up in that area on my grandfather s and father s lands
from about 1922 they were taking pictures of my mother s adopted son who was my grandfather and finally in this year in 1998 i have seen it
he went home to his grandchildren and you could tell that he felt at home because he was going home to his grandchildren and this was filmed in 1926
just looking at films and pictures it can really effect you it stirs up strong feelings i am wondering how we can repatriate these types of items
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
which of you want to answer
mr havioyak or your deputy
mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
very briefly mr chairman if you remember what i stated a couple of days ago that we are preparing to look into a museum in nunavut and we will be working quite closely with nti and the heritage trust
we are starting to organize and prepare for this but i will always keep you up to date on what is going on
the old photographs and artifacts that you talked about that are overseas and elsewhere around canada like i said we are new and just starting to work quite closely with heritage trust and nti
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr puqiqnak do you have any further comments
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i wasn t expecting to be called so fast
in respect to the community elders committees i believe they will be utilized by the department where there are existing committees
will they be given responsibility or duties to ensure that knowledge is garnered by the department
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
either of you may respond either mr irniq or the minister
mr irniq
mr irniq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
some of the duties under our mandate in respect to the elders we are looking into that it is under review
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irniq
mr nutarak do you want to add further questions
thank you mr nutarak
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
perhaps for the younger generation i will be asking about the youth
the youth constitute the largest percentage of our population in nunavut
is there a better way of ensuring that life is easier are you looking into those types of options
that is my question about the youth
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
thank you mr akesuk mr irniq
mr irniq
mr chairman yes we are conducting a review as to how we are dealing with the future government
i keep referring back to the conference that we had in cambridge
that seems like the first step for both the youth as well as the kinds of directives that we are looking at
mr chairman we have been told the direction for which we are to undertake
for example we will concentrate a lot on assisting our youth in nunavut because they are our future
this is one of the issues that the department is passionate about
we are trying to deal with it by looking at the different options in respect to the youth
there are different types of organizations
for example in baffin keewatin and in nunavut as well as in the west
we have worked with those organizations to try and develop new initiatives
it is a brand new department and we are still behind on some of our duties
when this was given to us last year i thought it would be like catching your first walrus
it was like trying to connect or build a walrus and it took a lot of thinking and planning
we have had a lot of co-operation especially in trying to deal with the youth
we are trying to work with the youth
we are trying to be of assistance to the youth
thank you mr akesuk thank you mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i have some questions
my first one relates to the comments that were made in the ministers opening address
it indicated that the department is developing a language policy
i am also a member of a new standing committee which has the mandate to appoint positions by statutory authority that are made by the legislative assembly
one of those positions is the official languages commissioner
mr chairman i would like to know if the department will be looking to work in conjunction with the standing committee in the development of the policy as well as any other changes to the act
those will directly effect the role of the official languages commissioner which is something that our standing committee is mandated to look at
i am wondering if there is a willingness to work together in order to develop that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
either one of you can respond to his question mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak
i would like to work closely with everybody because it involves everybody
we all have to team up together and work together and whoever is willing to help out is welcome also like i said we have to work together to regain our past
peter has more to say
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr irniq do you want to give a supplementary
mr irniq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would just like to supplement my ministers comments in regard to this issue
language in the past language services when we were growing up it did not seem to be very important but today it is very important and it effects all of nunavut
i would also like to thank the member for asking a question in regards to the official language commissioner
one of our first priorities in languages and one of our goals for language the inuktitut language is that we protect it as well as promote the inuktitut language in a vibrant society governed by a responsible government
with our rating system we keep talking about how we can improve the use of language
last year when we first started working on the future government of nunavut the language issue was one of our priorities when we were planning to set up the department the department of culture education languages and youth
at this time we do have a language director atima hadlari who is sitting in the gallery at this time
we are now working on the language services to assist the government of nunavut on the inuktitut language as the working language
we have all the translation services for both the public service people of nunavut inuktitut and inuinnaqtun
we are to work with the department of education from kindergarten to grade twelve in making the inuktitut language the instruction curriculum
we will work with your standing committee
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr tootoo do you have any further comments
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr deputy minister for that response
i will let you know that i will inform our staff from our committee of this and you will more than likely be hearing from them
i look forward to working together to develop this policy
mr chairman the deputy minister touched on another issue that is important for providing all the documents in inuktitut and also in english
is the department looking at starting up the interpreter corp which was a division in the old department of education
is the department looking at setting up similar type services in the department
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr havioyak or his deputy can respond
mr irniq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
thank you for the question
i think that it is going to be a bit different from the g n w t the language service is quite different then g n w t
in the past the g n w t had an interpreter corp and later on a language bureau was established
once the language bureau was done away with we had taken the language bureau department back to the departments when it was with g n w t
i think that this department will be a little bit different
when we come to the language bureau they will provide interpreting and translation services but mainly we will be focusing on the three interpretative translators which will be the inuit language specialists
it will be a bit different then being an interpreter
they will be the people to protect and to preserve the inuktitut language
also while they are working on the language system they will also work with nti regional communities such as qia and nunavut social development council
while we are working with these other organizations we would also like to preserve our inuktitut language
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irniq
mr tootoo do you have any further questions
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
again going back to the ministers comments where he mentioned the youth division and that there is a key link between the government and youth
mr chairman i am wondering if the department has any specific plans in providing for any assistance for youth facilities and programs geared specifically towards youth
they are getting into mischief and causing problems
i was wondering if the department has taken any specific initiatives targeted towards this area
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
either the minister or the deputy can respond
hon donald havioyak
your comments are very interesting
in all the communities from kugluktuk to iqaluit to sanikiluaq we have problems with the youth
we also realize that the youths create a lot of problems when they have nothing to do
they are getting into a lot of mischief because they have no places to go
we also know that this affects everyone in the communities
i think that eventually once we have the capital plans and when they are in place
we need assistance so we can create these programs for our youth
i think that if we can all help each other we can eventually create some places for these kids to go
i will be working on this
we would like to make these programs available for the youth
if my deputy minister can add a supplementary to it
chairperson interpretation
mr irniq would you like to make a supplementary response
mr irniq interpretation
please just a short supplementary response
in nunavut we would like to work with the youth in respect to the fact that the youth do not have any place to go or anything to do
we will be working with the communities and working with the youth
we are urging the youth to work with us
their needs are great so there are youth programs in each region and we would like to work with youth and youth programs in the future and today
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister and peter
mr you may ask your question again
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
mr chairman from the response i got the minister would like to work with us to get some funding in order to offer these sort of programs for the youth
the minister has stated that there is no funding available for these types of programs
chairperson
thank you mr tootoo
hon donald havioyak
you are correct
we do not have any funding but we will still be working on these issues
right now we are working on the process of hiring a senior advisor for youth
we are also in the process of hiring a youth co-ordinator
chairperson
thank you mr havioyak
mr tootoo
mr chairman i suppose i received my response
there is no funding
as for supplementary comments i am just surprised mr chairman that a territory with such a large youth population that there have been no dollars allocated for youth programs
this really surprises me mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
hon donald havioyak interpretation we are only 50 days old and of course we could not jump in and get things going right away
you must keep in mind that we are a very young government chairperson interpretation
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr minister
hon donald havioyak
we do know where iq is going and we are going to work with the nunavut social development council to develop topics on iq
we want to include iq within the government responsibilities but we have to work closely with our nunavut partners especially the nunavut social development council
perhaps mr irniq may be able to add something to this
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr irniq
mr irniq interpretation
that is a very excellent question regarding inuit qaujimajatuqangit and where we are going to go today and where we will be going
the government of the n w t used to practice traditional knowledge in their schools such as in rankin inlet
in regards to iq rankin inlet had midwifery
i believe that they practice midwifery today i am not sure if they are still practicing that today however they practised midwifery using inuit traditional knowledge
i do know quite a bit about caribou and what their migration patterns are
with the elders and the renewable resources working together then we can begin to see a community that is practicing traditional knowledge
our hunting rights and the licenses that we use presently should be using traditional inuit knowledge
the governments call this the cultural inclusion programs
inuit traditional knowledge is an old term which we finally started using in igloolik this past summer at a conference
the development council set up this conference with us and last year in march of 1998 we had a work shop
we invited all the elders from all over the nunavut area they went to this conference in igloolik to talk about inuit traditional knowledge
while we were there in igloolik we discussed various cultural issues in regards to inuit lifestyles shamanism and traditional loss for example traditional adoption which we still utilize today
we also covered survival skills land skills hunting the environment health education and languages
we covered all these topics at our meetings when we were having our meeting
in august the documents were translated from the inuit traditional knowledge
that s the question that we asked ourselves for example the social services the justice department educators ourselves and employment agencies got together and we put together a statement that would be used as a guideline by the nunavut government
in regards to inuit traditional knowledge that s what we did when we were preparing for the nunavut government
to date we still have dialogue on how we can implement the inuit traditional knowledge in regards to various issues that i mentioned how we could instil more of the inuit traditional knowledge into the government system
to date iq inuit traditions have been discussed and we have also talked about how we can use the elder s more and languages
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irniq
mr o brien do you have any further comments
mr o brien
that s fine mr chairman thank you mr minister and the deputy for those comments
chairperson interpretation
i have no more names on my list
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu
interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i think it s been 3 years now that i have been a member of the nunavut wildlife board
the inuit are very closely linked to the environment and to the different seasons and it s results in the winter and in the spring
our world revolves around the changing seasons and i would seriously like your department to consider using inuit traditional knowledge when it comes to environmental studies and so on
so we got a true picture of the north it s not a question it s just a comment that i wanted to make and i hope that i got my point across
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu it s very true
there s a lot of word that we use for the environment either the minister or the deputy minister can make a response to mr iqaqrialu s comment mr irniq
mr irniq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we discussed the various issues in regards to inuit traditional knowledge with the nunavut social development council
we covered various topics like land survival weather and we include the environment and everything else in these discussion

thank you mr chairman
i apologize mr chairman we re not trying to keep any information confidential
we will have to work closely together with the nunavut social development council i cannot pin point a deadline i apologize mr chairman because i cannot answer your question directly but we will be working on it
like i was saying i could use an example of the elders who are now in the schools teaching inuit traditional knowledge
that s now in existence we hear from the governments that we have to do more in regards to inuit traditional knowledge and we will keep working on it in the future
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr deputy minister

mr tootoo do you have a question
mr tootoo
thank you chairperson
chairperson under this directorate falls a section that used to be in another department which is the status of women council i believe in that area over in executive
i believe there s just an over all general position for equality advisor
i m just wondering if that is going to be coming back into this division within the new department
for my understanding the equality advisor is just general across the board for everybody i m just wondering if that s something that s going to be put back in after
thank you chairperson

thank you chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr irniq
mr irniq interpretation
thank you chairperson
the difference between the two is the status woman is in the nunavut government and nunavut women s association is established in rankin inlet

the status of women is within part of the nunavut government

they re on a preparation stage so once we have everything else we will let you know peter will be add further to that
the women of nunavut and men of nunavut have to work more closely together but right now we re working on the options paper to date

thank you chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr bain
mr bain
thank you chairperson
yes the 1 8 million in grants and contributions is specifically is for culture language elders and youths and will service the needs of members asking about the use
the remainder of that total amount 2 4 million are the status of women s grants money

qujannamiik

mr havioyak if you would respond please
mr bain

chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you chairperson
mr chairperson i m new at this so maybe i can be clarified
this is my understanding once we approve the budget that s presented here that s how they go forward for the rest of the year
the only way that they can be changed is through decisions approved through cabinet and then approved by all the members in the house
i am just wondering if i can get some clarification on that mr chairperson
thank you
since it is in respect to the nunavut government i would like to ask the minister of finance to answer that if you don t mind
chairperson interpretation
i am sorry i wasn t could i ask the finance minister to answer that question mr is it ng or ning
thank you
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman just to clarify on the issue of grants and contributions that come before the house under different departments
so you are approving a broader classification of a grant program which allows the department to expend funds under that category
so it is not tied to specific projects yet a lot of these programs because those applications run during the course of the year
it is not right now that you would know all of the specific details on those
if you use another example under sustainable development business grant contribution program
you don t know what over the course of the year right now what applications are going to come in so you have a set category for that funding that allows the department to disperse the funding
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
no other programs no other contributions would be allowed in there
is that what the minister is stating
thank you mr chairman

good morning
i would like to ask mr alakannuark to begin the opening prayer
>>prayer
speakers ruling
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
at this time i would like to make some comments regarding the questions on the gun control legislation posed last week
interpretation ends during last wednesday s oral question period i ruled a question out of order on this matter
having now had the opportunity to review the written record and after consultation with legal counsel i am prepared to issue a full ruling
the issue in question here is the sub judice convention
however the application of this convention must be balanced
so as to ensure that the workings of the courts are not interfered with while at the same time allowing members of the legislative assembly to exercise their right to freedom of speech
in matters that directly affect specific individuals in criminal cases the convention is strictly applied
in other types of cases more leeway exists for members to inquire into matters of public interest
i would remind members however that while ministers may choose to answer questions on this issue they are perfectly entitled to decline to answer as indeed they are with any question
thank you

corrections planning
hon jack anawak interpretation thank you mr speaker
as members are aware nunavut faces some serious challenges with respect to corrections
there are more than twice as many inmates as there are beds in the baffin correctional centre here in iqaluit
we would like to have more of our inmates here in nunavut but the baffin correctional centre has no more room
it is already very overcrowded
to help address this problem we have begun some serious planning
the nunavut department of justice has established a corrections planning committee to review corrections program and facility requirements and to make recommendations
the committee has representation from communities as well as from the nunavut social development council the rcmp and the federal and the nunavut corrections systems
the representatives from our communities are
becky kudloo from baker lake
natsiq kango from iqaluit
simeonie natsek from repulse bay
elik tologanaq from cambridge bay
mosha akavak from iqaluit representing the baffin correctional centre and
elijah erkloo from pond inlet representing the nunavut social development council
the corrections planning committee is chaired by rebecca williams assistant deputy minister of the department of justice
i have asked the committee to consider new approaches to the way in which inmates are handled both in institutions and in the communities
committee members had productive meetings in iqaluit for three days last week
they will meet again in mid-july and will have a draft report by the end of august
the final report will contain specific recommendations for action
the corrections planning committee will present their final report to me in early october
i look forward to receiving the committee s final report and to sharing the report with my colleagues
i look forward to working together so we can make improvements to nunavut s corrections system
we received a letter from the baffin correctional centre and it was also in the nunatsiaq news
it stated that there were a lot of improvements we can make in regards to the corrections system in nunavut
mr speaker we will be working very hard and diligently on this issue
thank you mr speaker

question 153 - 1 2
eligibility for staff housing
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is for the minister responsible for human resources
first of all i would like to thank the minister for providing an answer to my question
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
that s minister of human resources mr speaker
in respect to that issue the circumstances about whether an employee would actually be eligible for government of nunavut staff housing it depends on the individuals circumstances
as it stands now our policy is that we provide staff housing where necessary to support the staffing process
so it depends on the individuals circumstances thank you
speaker
thank you mr ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the minister stated that they provide it in order to facilitate the hiring process
does that mean then mr speaker that if there is someone who may be living with other family members they are not eligible for staff housing
is that what the minister is saying
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister of human resources mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i didn t say that i said that it would depend on the individual circumstances of that employee thank you
speaker
thank you mr ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker in looking at the written response given to me by the minister i don t believe it says in there anywhere about looking specifically on a case by case basis
i would like to ask the minister if the policy is there for everyone or is it only there for certain people
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister of human resources mr ng
mr ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker our policy impacts all of our employees and as i indicated it depends on the individual need of each employee
so it would depend on their personal circumstances of whether or not they would be eligible for staff housing
unfortunately we don t have enough staff housing units for every single employee within the government so there are some criteria that determine where individuals would be eligible for staff housing
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr ng
your last question mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i am wondering if the minister could provide us with cases where someone would not be eligible for staff housing
as i look at the policy i believe that if someone doesn t own their own home if someone isn t already in their own home they re eligible for staff housing according to the policy
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister of human resources mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i guess to clarify again the staff housing isn t a right of employment or a condition of employment
we try to provide it as much as possible particularly in the circumstances where there are specific needs
on the broader issue the staff housing we need it primarily to try to implement our decentralization plans
as it stands now once we get some clarity to that it certainly has to be one of the key criteria as it stands now for eligibility for staff housing
thank you mr speaker

mr iqaqrialu
question 154 - 1 2
wildlife in captivity
mr iqaqrialu interpretation thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct my question to the minister of sustainable development
there have been cases where wild animals have been taken as pets or sent to zoos
for inuit it s not a very pretty sight to see those wild animals in cages
what are we going to do about wildlife that are taken captives as nunavut government
what approach are we going to be taking
it is not very nice to see wild animals caged because they suffer and it can be inhumane
i would like to see some kind of approach as nunavut government and would like to know what kind of plans you have
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister of sustainable development mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
possibly first of all since we are a new government we have to work with the people of nunavut and work co-operatively
i would like to work closely together with the other organizations before we come with a different approach
we should also look at the ways the wildlife are studied by scientists and biologists and so on
so we have to work closely together with the various organizations out there consult with the people of nunavut in regards to wildlife that are taken captive
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr iqaqrialu

just a comment
oral question mr irqittuq
question 155 - 1 2
financial support for student exchange trip
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker this question is for the minister of education
the students of igloolik have asked me in writing whether they can get support when they go down south
they are asking for financial assistance such as per diems for meals
this question is to the minister of education my question is
can the students get financial support
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation thank you mr speaker
we have reviewed this request
we can give support to the students of arctic college by way of financial contributions
however we don t have anything for the students up to grade 12
if they are going to be going on trips outside of nunavut unfortunately we don t have any money set aside for financial support up to grade 12
however with that in mind this issue is being reviewed by my department to find out where we can make changes to our practices
we don t have anything right now but these types of situations are under review
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
with that response in mind i can tell the students of igloolik that there is no money available
speaker
thank you mr irqittuq
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
well you can make that response to the students if you wish but mr speaker i would want to find out from these students how they feel towards this issue as a government
they are not going down south until this summer so in the meanwhile it could be very likely that we could accommodate their request before they go down south
i would make that response to the mla for igloolik
thank you
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions mr mclean
question 156 - 1 2
correctional facilities plan recommendations
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question this morning is to the minister of justice
i was pleased to hear about the correction facility planning that is going on right now by the committee
mr speaker as we all know we are all effected by corrections and as mayors hamlet councillors and mla s we are constantly being called and asked for help by incarcerated individuals in correctional facilities and their families
i am pleased to see that the committee will meet again in mid-july to have a draft report by the end of august
i am wondering if the minister would commit to giving all the hamlet councils and the mla s some input into the final recommendations that are coming down in october
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean
minister of justice mr anawak hon jack anawak
thank you mr speaker
yes we will do that as soon as i have something to send to the hamlets in terms of soliciting their recommendations keeping in mind that we want to wrap this up fairly shortly
we will ensure that the hamlets are consulted

oral questions
mr puqiqnak
question 157 - 1 2
certification for inuit experts
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister of education
the unilingual inuit in nunavut there is supposed to be a certification program for inuit who have no formal certification but are experts in their own traditions
they are able to teach their specialized skills to the younger generation and even though we have this expertise existing in the communities sometimes others are brought in from outside nunavut to teach these courses
i would like to know the status of this issue
speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
to the minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation thank you mr speaker
we are looking at that
there are inuinnaqtun and inuktitut unilingual people who graduated in a program who were able to get certification
i think that there were four or five people
they are experts in their own right and we are looking at how we can get them certified
our department is currently reviewing how we can accommodate this but we have to keep in mind that these may not be recognized as a credit program in other educational institutions in southern canada
the way it is right now the students are given credit for taking programs for example grade 10 11 and 12 and they have to earn so many credits in specific subjects
these may not be part of the recognized subjects but i have asked my staff in the department to look into this very area
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would just like to clarify my question
those people who are going to educational institutions outside the community and i have taken part in that as an oil burner mechanic and heavy equipment operator trainee
we still see some nunavummiut who are going to southern institutions to take part in these programs
we will continue to see these programs being taught elsewhere outside of nunavut
i think that many people have done this work we have welders and mechanics that have had to go outside nunavut to learn those things
i think that we have people in nunavut available to teach those courses
i think that many people can be certified to teach those courses in nunavut
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the arctic college is currently looking at that very subject and we are asking them to review their policies for programs that can be taught to unilingual inuit
or somewhere in alberta
there have been programs that were designed for unilingual people there were also courses available in electrical field and currently arctic college and our department are working together and consulting with each other to update those programs
the building codes are changed from time to time and qualifications for electricians with new technology have to be upgraded
that is also true in the mechanics field with the new models of cars so some of these courses are ongoing and to remain qualified in the new technology professionals need to be available to keep them updated
in europe for those people that don t speak english at all they are certified and they know their areas and i don t see why that we cannot make some similar accommodation for that
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
mr speaker this is directed to the minister of education
i know that this is being considered by the department and arctic college and i am happy that the department and the minister are looking at this area

oral questions
mr iqaqrialu
question 158 - 1 2
search and rescue
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister of transportation
in the north we see hunters lost out on the land who have to be rescued by airplanes
i think aircraft are used mostly for searching and sometimes they miss the people even though they might fly right over them
i think this is a very expensive exercise when it has to be conducted
now that we have a new government i wonder how the government is going to improving methods for search and rescue
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister responsible for search and rescue mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
search and rescue is very difficult at the best of times in nunavut
i know that this touches a lot of people in nunavut when someone is lost out on the land
last winter we had to do many searches near rankin inlet and when we have to use an aircraft we need to have people who know the land in the aircraft and we have kept that practice
we are starting to review this area and what our policy is going to be
we will keep the members and the communities informed on how we are going to be dealing with this area
but we will be utilizing people who are knowledgeable of local conditions
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
oral questions
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i think that we have conducted search and rescue at any given time of the year
sometimes an aircraft will be in the area but will not spot the people that they are searching for
sometimes the aircraft will be very close to the lost people and won spot them
i wonder if this can be looked at as soon as possible
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr anawak if you would like to respond i will allow you
mr anawak minister responsible for search and rescue
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes search and rescue is a serious subject at any time for the people in nunavut
i think that we need to look at ways other than aircraft for search and rescue exercises
so we would like to take a good look at all the ways that we have done search and rescue
i think that the member has been involved in this area and i think that we need this input because all of the areas and communities in nunavut are all different terrain
for example in keewatin we don t have too many mountainous areas but in the baffin region the landscape is very different than that area and the kitikmeot
we need to utilize the local people who know the land in their area
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
oral questions
mr iqaqrialu

yes we will be looking at this in the very near future because we are aware that we need to do search and rescue at any given time

question 159 - 1 2
lack of social workers in arviat
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker a week or so ago i raised a question to the minister of health mr picco in reference to the concern with the lack of social workers in my community
i believe there is only one individual there at a level one when normally we would have four
so i once again ask the minister if he would look into this matter and try to resolve it so that the people from my community can have a level of service that they should have
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for health mr picco

question 160 - 1 2
housing policy for drug dealers and bootleggers
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question today is to the minister responsible for housing
when i was making my questions to the minister responsible for the liquor board in regards to extra legislation to be tougher on bootlegging in our communities
i wonder if the ministers would commit to working together to draft up legislation regarding convicted drug peddlers and bootleggers living in public housing
if they would draft up legislation that would have these convicted people evicted from public housing
thank you mr speaker

question 162 - 1 2
staff housing for iqaluit employees
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question again is to the minister responsible for human resources
he had indicated that the main focus for staff housing is to deal with decentralization
mr speaker i would like to ask the minister if the staff housing that is available in iqaluit is available for employees from iqaluit or are they just for employees that will be from outside of iqaluit
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister responsible for human resources mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i believe that i have indicated when the committee was reviewing the department of human resources budget there is actually two processes in iqaluit
there is the regional housing allocations and there are the headquarters allocations which we assumed from the office of the interim commissioner
some as i have indicated through the office of the interim commissioner some through the government of the nwt that were transferred over to us and upcoming nunavut construction units as well mr speaker thank you
speaker
thank you mr ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo

thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister responsible for human resources mr ng
hon kelvin ng

mr speaker it s really hard to generalize on a specific circumstance that a member might be referring to i don t know the full details of what the circumstances around the case that he might be speaking of
again i would say it would have to be on a case by case basis

final supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
thank you mr speaker

thank you mr tootoo
minister responsible for human resources mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
but again i have to stress that it is not a right that all employees have housing although if that were the case and they all wanted it and we had units available that would be fine
unfortunately we don t have enough units for every single employee
so we have to take into consideration some of the governments needs and requirements as well as the employees needs and requirements in how we allocate our staff housing units mr speaker

doctor for igloolik
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct this question to the minister of health & social services in respect to the issue of a doctor in igloolik
i spoke to the doctor in question and that doctor does want to go to igloolik
mr speaker i would like to ask the minister of health & social services if he has found staff housing for the individual
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister responsible for health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker about three weeks ago when i was in igloolik meeting with the town the mayor and the council members they were very excited about the doctor going into igloolik
i had spoken to the doctor previous to that after church one day and she expressed to me her interest in going to igloolik
after reviewing that letter and then again having the opportunity to speak to the doctor on saturday she indicated that she was interested in going to igloolik instead of the community identified by the health board
after saying that mr speaker i understand from talking to the doctor that she had arranged housing on the ground in igloolik
i had spoken to my cabinet colleagues expressing that if there was a problem getting housing that maybe we could look at one of the units that we had available in igloolik
this doesn t seem to be the problem the problem seems to be the health board has decided that maybe igloolik the community that they wanted the doctor to go to thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
oral question mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in respect to the minister of health & social services his answer stated that there is housing available but it is the baffin regional health board that they re the ones that don t want the doctor to go to igloolik
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister responsible for health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
yes as i indicated that the health board i should back up on this
after speaking to the doctor originally she had looked at another community to go to and she had identified that community she was interested in going the health board said no we would like you to go to igloolik
last week i received a letter from the health board indicating that they have decided that the doctor should not go to igloolik because of operational requirements that they were going to send the doctor to another community
after speaking to the doctor on saturday the doctor indicated to me that she was still interested in going to igloolik and indeed housing does not seem to be the problem that it was going to be before
so now it is operational issue with the regional health board
that is something that me as the minister of health that i will be looking into
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
oral questions
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
he stated this and i am wondering why he made that statement before it was even implemented and i am wondering why he s allowing the baffin regional health board to dictate where that doctor is going
that is my question mr speaker
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr picco minister of health
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i could answer that in one way and i could say that is probably why we are looking at getting rid of the health boards but i won t
somewhere out of the blue i get a letter last week stating that the health board changed their mind that they do not believe under operational requirements that it would be conducive to have the doctor in igloolik
i am saying to you that i have spoken to the doctor again i have spoken to her on saturday indeed the member has spoken to the doctor
she would like to go to igloolik the housing doesn t seem to be a problem indeed i will address this with the health board

question 164 - 1 2
power rate increases in clyde river
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is in relation to the minister of ntpc
i wanted documentation and i did receive a letter but unfortunately it wasn t translated
i might be mistaken but the issue i wanted to understand in respect of the percentage of the payment or subsidy which was not listed in this letter this issue was the one i have the most feeling about
i would like this clarified in respect to electrical power bills and what is the percentage rate
for example i have seen a little bit of it and i am not sure whether it is true or not where the percentage is
i would want to understand exactly how much percentage would be included for the community and what are they going to give the community
i really would like to understand the increase and the decrease of the costs
i would like to find that out before i ask even more questions
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister responsible for the nwt power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker and i thank the member for his question
indeed as i explained in the house the member had requested the information and i had to then again request the information from the power corporation head office in hay river
in the expediency to get that letter to the member as i explained the power corporation from hay river never had an opportunity to translate it
so this gives me an opportunity to explain i guess some of the circumstances surrounding the clyde river plant
the existing power plant in clyde river is too small to meet the community s power needs which have grown at about 4% per year since 1984
now mr speaker the engine replacements with larger units is no longer possible for the plant in clyde river
the nunavut director of operations mr axle have based here in iqaluit met with the community of clyde river and followed up on the meeting
indeed again in april of 1999 also discussed the project
now it is a three year project worth mr speaker to the community of clyde river 3 9 million dollars
now the increased capacity will supply anticipated growth for the community of clyde river for at least the next five years and it is a new fuel-efficient engine and it will reduce long term operating costs
a contract was awarded on may 15th to kudlik construction ltd of rankin inlet and kudlik recently completed work for the corporation in repulse bay and have some experience in this area

oral questions mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in respect to the community s population gross revenues it is going to effect the community and it is going to cause even more hardship
i know that we really require that electrical outlet but it is still causes a concern
the residents of my community have not heard and are not aware of the details
perhaps i think that the ntpc has already made those plans and they want to upgrade it
we have to understand all of the details before we are planning it
i think there has not been enough involvement of the local community in the planning
the fact that the community residents are not aware of all the details this may delay it if there is no funding allocated for the increase
these are some of the options we have to look at
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister responsible for ntpc mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the member makes a good point
indeed the corporation recognizes that it is a very high increase and will be reviewing options to look at how we can decrease that
now mr speaker i should point out that the actual process for reviewing costs and setting rates belongs with the nunavut public utilities board
that institution that organization that group that board that corporation must ask for review and get approval before it can set any new rates through the nunavut public utilities board
the hamlet of clyde river will be notified when this review will take place and indeed be invited to participate
this is not expected mr speaker to happen before early or mid-2000 the year 2000
there will be no changes mr speaker to the rates in clyde river until after this review is completed and indeed except for a possible adjustment next spring for rate re-balancing purposes
thank you for your vote of confidence mr ng
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
oral question mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i didn t know the meetings happened in clyde river perhaps i missed them somehow
i know that it has to be reviewed because in my community there are many unemployed people and the consultation process is not too good
i know that once we increase the rate it is going to put hardship on many people in my community because they are unemployed
i want you to come to my community very much so that we can discuss this matter
if you are actually going to come to my community we will see you there and i hope we can explain this to the community
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco

if a person is not employed and living in social housing their rate will not increased
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
final supplementary mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my last question
that is why i was a bit concerned and worried about the offices commercial offices
i know that private businesses and commercial offices will be impacted so therefore we have to explain all these aspects to the community
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker under the approval of the public utilities board the process for community based rates and the costs of the plant will be charged over time to the customers in clyde river
now there is no direct assistance for this type of construction project but as i explained the nunavut public utilities board will have to review any rate increase
i again want to assure the member that unemployed people people in social housing will not be negatively impacted and indeed like i said when i get to clyde we ll have the opportunity to discuss it
i think the member makes a good point that it is a very high increase and as i said the corporation also recognizes that
we are going to try and do what we can to help negate a huge one shot deal of a rate increase
thank you mr speaker

thank you mr picco

opening comments - department of health & social services main estimates
hon ed picco
qujannamiik mr chairperson
good afternoon colleagues although i find this chair comfortable i would more be comfortable in that other chair rather than sit this close to mr ng but after saying that i m prepared to do my opening comments
mr chairperson and honourable members of the legislative assembly i m pleased to present to you that 1999/2000 main estimates for the department of health and social services
later when we go to the witness table i will be joined by mr ken macrury who s the deputy minister of department and mrs rosemary cooper who s the assistant deputy minister
health and social services is important to all of us and to each of our families
this department faces a range of issues that affect every person everyday across the nunavut
the 1999/2000 main estimates reflected departmental move towards the promotion and prevention oriented delivery system in nunavut
the department in partnership with communities families and individuals is striving to create a system that is more reflective of nunavut realities and responsive to the people of nunavut
the business plan we submitted outlines critical issues facing the department of health and social services we face serious challenges mr chairperson in addressing these issues
the change is required will not come easily and quickly although we have taken early steps and making the required changes to the department
our business plan contains a vision which calls to the department to delivery program and to services that or people oriented
culturally sensitive provide for continue of care provide a seamless service is sustainable over the long term instils health responsibilities and individuals families and communities and is prevention oriented
mr chairperson the health status indicators for nunavut are best described as being dramatic
nunavut faces a great challenge in improving the health status indicators and i know with time we will make changes that will improve the status of health in nunavut
i believe the creation of nunavut is an opportunity an opportunity that must be used to initiate the health and social services reform
our approach to health and social services reform uses a community development approach to achieve successful community development we will initiate healthy public policy
to achieve inuit employment targets mandated in nunavut land claim agreement we will initiate a long term strategy for the training of inuit health and social services providers
this will result in service delivery that reflects the culture values and beliefs of the majority of our population
in order mr chairperson to achieve this we require partnerships partnerships with other departments non governmental aid organizations volunteer organizations communities and others committed to the well being of nunavut residents
is important to realize that nunavut is experiencing a rapid population growth with approximately 50% of the population under 25 years of age a situation mr chairperson that is unique in canada
individuals in this age group place a highest demands in health and social services we must be in a position to meet these requirements
we need new ways of doing things in nunavut health and well being require approaches and ways to delivering care that go beyond illness hospital and professional services
integrated and comprehensive prevention and promotion efforts are required
in nunavut mr chairperson we require a modern information technology system
nunavut comprises 24% of canada s land mass as you all know we are require to deliver services in 26 widely disbursed communities
through technology we have an opportunity for creative responses service delivery education of health professionals and learning from each other
we must also provide the opportunity for quality care cost effectiveness and very timely service delivered over vast distances
the technologies of tele-health applications will realize the substantial financial savings over time
mr chairperson heavy demands will be placed on available financial resources of the department and of this government by an increasing population a focus on integrated prevention and promotion efforts acquisition of new diagnostic tool and acute care services
the challenges we face in department of health and social services are extensive we are building a confident professional integrated team that will deliver the very best service for the residents of nunavut within the available resources
i trust this assembly will look favourably on the budget that i m about to present the health and social services budget is divided into 2 main categories operation and maintenance or o&m and capital
on our operation and maintenance mr chairperson the budget for the department is detailed on pages 10-3 which indicates on our total operation and maintenance budget is 117 million and 427 thousand dollars
our original budget request was based on a detailed analysis of the requirement to provide enhance service to the residents of nunavut
the reduction from the original request was based on the realities on the amount of funds available to all departments and to the government of nunavut as a whole
we will try to minimize the impacts on service delivery to best of our ability while living within the allocated amount however this may result in a budget that requires significance increase over time
the operation and maintenance budget is divided as for the pie graph in page 10-3 you will note that the primary acute programs account for 50% or 59 8 million of the budget
the directorate of the department is currently composed of 15 positions out of a plan total staff compliment of 72 and 40% current staff are inuit
all of the expenses are associated with these position including such as a travel office supplies computers telephones are within 10 6% or 2 6 million allocations
we also included in the directorates from program delivery expenses which are delivered directly from headquarters
community health programs at 8 2% or 9 7 million and children s programs mr chairperson at 3 5% or 4 2 million round out the total operations and maintenance budget
mr chairperson the department of health and social services has a small capital budget totalling 2 188 million there are number of capital projects in fall within this budget and he will provide more detail about those as we progress
the department of health and social services is working with the department of finance in the construction of the health centre in arviat this year
this project is being finance as a p3 project and it will not be reflected in our capital budget
mr chairperson and honourable members this concludes the formal part of my presentation today we ll be please to answer any question you may have about the budget for the department of health and social services
i will also welcome your comments on how we can work together to build a stronger health and social services in nunavut
thank you mr chairperson
>>applause
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister of health and social services
i will now ask a representative of the standing committee to give us their report of their review of the budget

chairperson interpretation
sorry please repeat that
mr nutarak interpretation
mr kattuk will read
chairperson interpretation
okay mr kattuk go ahead
report of the standing committee on culture education and health on the 1999/2000 main estimates for the department of health and social services
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson i will read a part of it in english and mr o brien will conclude
the honourable ed picco minister of health and social services and departmental officials met with the standing committee on april 29 1999
the minister spoke very openly about the challenges facing his department and the opportunities that some of the new technology and training may provide in meeting the needs of communities
the standing committee also appreciated the preparation by the minister and his department which was evident at our meeting
the standing committee had a very dynamic dialogue with the minister and looks forward to talking about these issues in the future
business plan/ operations/ programs
the department of health and social services has an o&m budget of $117 400 000 of which $75 000 000 in contributions to the health boards to deliver programs which includes $15 million for medical travel
the need for an inuit nurse training program
a most compelling issue for the members of the standing committee is the need for inuit nurses in nunavut
the minister outlined the departmental concerns regarding the high turnover of community nurses and the difficulties in recruiting nurses from the south
this will be compounded now that a number of southern jurisdictions have recently announced nurse hiring increases
to the members the heavy workload on a few community nurses particularly where the full complement of nurses are not available [vacancy rates range from 22 to 42%] is more than a concern
it is a crisis in the communities
members were advised that at this time there is only one inuit nurse in nunavut who recently began nursing in arviat
at the health board level only 3% of the professional staff are filled by inuit
the minister laid out a plan to fix part of this situation which the members fully support
a number of students have already completed a pre-nursing year with arctic college and could begin a nursing a program in september if it were to be offered
however there is no budget at this time for this critically important program
there is no point talking about article 23 and inuit employment in government positions in the health area unless proper training programs are being provided
it took thirty years of ntep type programs to get 34% inuit teachers and 4 out of 42 inuit principles thirty years ago dr
percy declared the need for an inuit nursing program - think where nunavut would be now if it had been properly initiated
the government has to start somewhere if we hope to see inuit health professionals in nunavut and it should start now
this department has a detailed plan they are ready to go and they need our support
a long term commitment is required if we are to see it through
members offered to come too if this would help
the minister noted that he had recently met with hon allan rock the federal minister of health and had raised these issues including the need for funding for an inuit nursing program
members commended the minister s efforts in this regard
mr kattuk
i will give mr o brien the recommendations to read
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mr kattuk for reading the report
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson the recommendations are as follows
recommendation
that as a first priority if additional resources can be found the programs identified by the department of health and social services for inuit nurse training be implemented in this fiscal year
cabinet decision to abolish the regional health boards
the standing committee appreciated very much the briefing that the department provided to us on the matter of the dissolution
chairperson interpretation excuse me i might be wrong but i think we are supposed to vote on each recommendation as we move along
no sorry please continue
mr o brien the standing committee appreciated very much the briefing that the department provided to us on the matter of the dissolution of the regional health boards and district education councils
this provided a lot of important background information to the members which we understand had been delivered to the cabinet and to the chairs and to executive directors of the regional health boards and district education councils
nevertheless members still have questions and they felt that the people in the communities will have questions too
there were small charts projecting savings but no details on how those numbers were generated
there will be more accountability to the elected minister but no complaints procedure was presented
members wondered if the department will create an ombudsman type of person to co-ordinate and streamline complaints to the minister
members noted that smaller communities would need someone local to whom they can send information regarding their concerns
who will take the initiative to create these councils if they don t currently exist
how do interagency committees fit in
what will be the checks and balances in this new system for individuals and communities with respect to their community health councils and the department how does this affect the departments commitment to decentralization
what positions will now go to pangnirtung
the minister stated that an outside person would begin working with the department and the boards to develop the transition plan and that the minister would bring it back to the standing committee in september
the standing committee looks forward to receiving the draft legislation and reviewing more complete plans at that time
recommendation
that the government of nunavut provide a detailed implementation plan to the standing committee which includes information on
that the government of nunavut develop a communication package for communities and nunavummiut including radio tv written materials and visits by the minister to communities and meetings such as the kitikmeot leaders forum
and that any savings realized from abolishing regional health boards be retained by the department of health and social services
tele-medicine
the minister presented some interesting information on tele-health facilities
these are currently in the communities of iqaluit pond inlet and cape dorset
they allow patients to come into the facility in pond inlet and be seen via technology and satellites by a doctor in iqaluit or even ottawa
it was noted that in a one-week period of 15 people who might have been referred to iqaluit by the community nurse only 3 still had to come to iqaluit after being seen by the doctor through tele-medicine
therefore the government saved the travel and accommodation costs of sending these people to iqaluit and the people were saved the trouble of leaving their community and family
departmental officials noted that tele-health facilities are quite expensive over $300 000 each but they can pay for themselves over a short period of years by saving money as outlined above
they may also be a vehicle to provide other services such as psychiatric counselling or supervision of probation and parole
the standing committee members were interested to see how this technology works and intend to follow-up to the invitation to visit the iqaluit hospital to see it in operation
in light of the difficulties in getting doctors to move to smaller communities in nunavut this may be an alternative
members noted that there are sometimes difficulties with the technology and it may be wise to wait until the satellite technology and linking is improved
however members look forward to receiving more information on the benefits and disadvantages of these facilities and how these facilities might be paid for in the future
capital plan - financing capital for new health facilities - p3
standing committee members welcomed the department s plan to conduct an audit of what health facilities and equipment were currently in each community along with an assessment of what shape they are in
all departments should do this type of capital audit
however members noted that the department really had no capital plan for this fiscal year - only one capital project of $12 000 for the gjoa haven health centre
over the past year members have heard various discussions about planned health facilities in the regional centres and the possibilities of p3 financing
members raised questions to the minister about p3 financing but did not receive much information
while innovative ways are needed to finance new health facilities members are concerned about moving forward with p3 financing before knowing more about the pros and cons
where will the operating dollars come for the o&m of these facilities

i think that i was supposed to ask you to introduce your officials but you were ahead of me so i thank you
are there any general questions the minister and his officials are now in the witness table
you can now ask your questions or if you have general comments regarding the departments
main estimates mr mclean i don t want to make mistake on your name this time go ahead mr mclean
mr mclean
qujannamiik uqaqtii
just in general comments that i want to make in health and social services
we all know that in health care professionals and what i d like to call the care givers in our communities are over worked underpaid and under appreciated
i m sure the current minister has a plan to help out with our care givers in our communities
and still to this day most of us living in remote communities away from hospitals have no way of finding out if we do carry a cancer ourselves so i think this have to addressed and seriously looked at
so i m sure the minister will be dealing with that over the next few year s
so i m sure the minister and i know his mandate was to use more iq in dealing with the family problems and situation
i m hoping that this will be fast track and in the long run it ll probably be more helpful in cost effective to use traditional knowledge in regards to suicide prevention and the family counselling
capital projects we talk about we hear about hospitals and regional centres and 3 of them are planned
well to me i m hoping that if they build these facilities in the regions that they re going to repatriate the dollars
is that the plan
and if the plan isn t repatriate these dollars for health care facilities where s the money going to come from i certainly hope it s not going to come from the decentralization budgets that were negotiated couple of years ago
so i m sure the minister will deal with that
chairperson interpretation thank you
minster of health & social services hon ed picco

mr mclean has indeed brought some of good points i had an opportunity to discuss with the members and indeed with mr mclean and some of the issues that he had brought forward
first of all i ll just touch base on some of them mr chairperson the member have talked about cancer and indeed we all know the concerns with cancer scenes the cancer on the rise or increase in nunavut
indeed as a jurisdiction in canada we still have to lowest rates of cancer incidents in the population in canada as a whole
i know for example that the concern has been brought forward before and in the past the breast screen for cancer and in need mammography unit in nunavut
and indeed here in nunavut the increase in cervical cancer has indeed on the rise so that s something we want to look at
under chronic care side of things and indeed again mr mclean is correct that something we have to incorporate not only at the regional level but in the smaller communities
on iq were using iq right now for example in to the adoption services and indeed i am a proponent of looking at ways of using a traditional inuit knowledge in suicide prevention and indeed mental health counselling
the prescription drug situation worth 3 times national average i m not aware of those figures that s something the department will have to look into
with that mr chairperson again i m available with my departmental staff of questions or comments on the department of health
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
thank you minister of health and social services
mr mclean any questions or comments
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
regarding the comments that the minister maybe have some information to the members
and with the retention tying in - what the status is on housing accommodations for these individuals as relates to benefits in regional housing cost
but we know that an issue that s been around for some time
i wonder if the minister can speak to this in general
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister of health and social services or any of your officials can respond to the question
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairperson
as we ve discussed in this house before the shortage of medical professionals is not a unique to nunavut
indeed it s pandemic in canada indeed in north america we see cases of other jurisdiction in canada hiring nurses in ontario and hiring out nurses in british columbia indeed the states united states come into canada to hire nurses
i want take this opportunity to thank them for their time and effort
we realize that after the government of northwest territory sold off all staff house units in the communities a lot of private entrepreneurs have taken control of those houses indeed some the rents being charged right now reflect that
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
thank you minister for health and social services
do you want to add something here mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you chairperson
mr chairperson from the ministers comments i assume that ll be the following session until we receive some kind of concrete plan and directions to how the government is going to deal with these issues
i ll continue on with some other comments in reference to services that in the past for example in keewatin some services that attempt to privatize some services
unfortunately or fortunately it didn t fly out that it s fair problems
i guess i m concerned at this point whether the minister and his department giving any consideration to looking at this again given the past history
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister of health and social services response
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson as the minister of health i want to make it perfectly clear that i have no ambition or drive or any other mandate move to look at the privatization of our health care system in nunavut
i am completely and personally philosophically against privatisation health care
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
thank you mr picco
mr o brien i believe you have another comment
mr o brien
mr chairperson i m please to hear the minister say that i m sure all the people at least hear that i live more than please to hear the comments
thank you

thank you mr o brien

you want to respond
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman

mr o brien
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr picco
that s good news for the people in keewatin and i m sure they ll sleep a lot easier knowing that services are in place for the next five years
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
i believe that this is just a comment
other comments
i believe we ran out of names
mr irqittuq proceed
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the question to the minister respect to the health boards
how much mandate or powers have been given to the boards from the ministers
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister of health
if you wish to respond or any of your officials
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
so for example when an operational issue comes up are you know do we need a social worker in x community or so on
as the minister of health i have to go then to the health board and say was the status or what is the situation in this community and then let the health board staff up in positions there
those types of operational issues are what the health boards are doing
so sometimes it looks like the power does not rest with the minister
i know the member is probably referring to the situation that we discussed this morning with the doctor for igloolik
i hope that helps explain the question or the comment of the member
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister of health
i believe you have a supplementary question
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the department of health or the boards probably have procedures or powers in place because i ve heard earlier that this the move initially made was not approved by way of motion
now i d just like to ask are their own officials allowed to make actions without consulting their boards
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
any response from the minister or whatever officials
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i not aware if the board of health has voted on this particular incident or not indeed boards have their own mandate there is boards governs as in place for each individual board
that s the board s decision
the board has circumvented it s own policies
so i wouldn t feel comfortable commenting on if the board circumvented their own policy have they voted on a policy
indeed if the staff of the health board made any independent decisions arbitrarily without going to the board
i m not aware of that and wouldn t be proper for me to comment on it
what i can say is its similar to the education board
if you have a question in staffing in school and everything then we have to look at the different education boards and say okay what s the status in the schools are
but again the board operate and the boards govern they have their own policies and procedures in place and i m not aware of the board health board is voted on this particular one
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister of health
mr irqittuq any additional questions
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister of health do you wish to respond
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman it s difficult for me to answer hypothetically
you know if this has been done
the power lies within the minister
if the board has circumvented a piece of legislation an act if they had done something that compromises the health of individuals then indeed the minister has to power to overturn that decision
in this case have they made a decision at the board level
i don t know because i don t know again if the decision of the board is has made
i haven t seen the motions i haven t seen copies of their minutes
that s something i ve asked the department to we re looking into right now to find out how exactly how the decision was made who made it and so on
so that s something that i take seriously as a minister and i am looking into it
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister of health
i believe we are quite clear with the question made by mr irqittuq but you don t really seem to respond fully
maybe we ll be provided with a response at a later time but i believe his question was to do with what authority you may have in convening with the health boards
mr tootoo you have a question
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman i almost stood up
i m wondering mr chairman if the minister and staff have any preliminary plans at this stage on how to readdress those issues
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister of health or officials
do you have a response
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman as a department like most departments we ve only actually in place with the budget since april 1st six weeks ago
as a minister i officially took over six weeks ago
it s been i can say very strong and steep learning curve
on the area of homelessness we do have one homeless shelter here in iqaluit that has had budget problems in the past several weeks and indeed some concern that the shelter would close
as a department we are aware of that
i believe my assistant deputy minister is working very closely with the homeless shelter committee to make sure that indeed the problem is alleviated and the homeless shelter has submitted a budget
as a department we are trying to be proactive
so hopefully we can rectify that in a week
that s an answer to the member s question
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation thank you mr minister of health
mr tootoo i believe you have a supplementary
proceed
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr minister for going ahead and answering my next question
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister of health
i believe you want to respond
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the negotiations are underway right now with the homeless shelter society and indeed as mr tootoo knows my assistant deputy minister mrs cooper has been working very closely with that group
it s very difficult for me to give a commitment that the centre will receive all that funding that they ve requested
i understand there is a shortfall of about twenty four thousand dollars right now from what they ve requested
i m acutely aware of the need and i will do whatever i can as the minister of health to make sure that those people are not put in any jeopardy for the closure of the facility
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister of health and social services
mr tootoo your last question
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i m relieved to hear those comments from the minister as i m sure all the staff and members of the homeless shelter committee are glad to hear those comments
my next question mr chairman is relating to the functional review of the programs through the hospital that s been mentioned by the minister of finance and also by the minister of health
i m wondering mr chairman if the minister could provide us with update on this review and also what it actually is that s being reviewed
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
for your information we re going to keep you to our ten minute limit
response from the minister of health and social services
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
now we are reviewing it as a government to see if they re applicable to see if they should be added or taken away or whatever
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister of health and social services
i will go back to you after we have given someone else an opportunity to make a few comments
mr tootoo i ll give mr kattuk and opportunity
we ll try and keep up to our ten minute limit
mr kattuk interpretation
mr chairman i have a question in regards to my constituency
the medical patients from sanikiluaq have to get on government charters in order to go to churchill and to winnipeg for medical treatment
i would like to know if your department is concerned about our community residents going to manitoba for medical services
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
minister of health and social services
if you would like to respond please
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i don t think we re concerned that you re going to winnipeg or manitoba because i mean the facilities there are very good
second to none
make sure that their health care needs are second to none
they should not be treated any different because they re sanikiluaq and other residents of nunavut
so we re looking as a department to find out what types of solutions we could put in place to alleviate some of these concerns that we ve heard from sanikiluaq as a department
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister of health and social services
mr kattuk go ahead
mr kattuk interpretation
i don t know if i understood you clearly
my question is the governments charter keewatin airlines and my question is are you concerned about the cost of chartering keewatin air services just from sanikiluaq to the keewatin or to manitoba
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
minister of health and social services
hon ed picco interpretation
i m really the boss mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
say it again
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman i understood the question
i guess the problem as to what we re trying to do is look at the cost
i am concerned at the cost of the charters
for example if we facilitated the usage of montreal instead of being chartered to manitoba would it be easier logistically would it be easier and cost us less money to go to montreal or ottawa
that s something we have to review
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister of health and social services
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
find out from the people of sanikiluaq which location they would prefer because there has to be a close consultation of the people of sanikiluaq if we re going to be making any changes
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i can commit to the member that before any changes will be put in place that indeed the department would consult with the people of sanikiluaq
for example if the patients of sanikiluaq are best served by going through manitoba that s logistically administratively and i guess financially better for the nunavut government or not
those types of issues we want to be able to review those before any decisions taken
there would be consultation with sanikiluaq find out exactly what the needs of sanikiluaq and the residents are
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
in the region of kitikmeot and keewatin and baffin we have a need for it takes a long time for the patients to get diagnosed early
any chronic disease
in gjoa haven there was one person who was sent out because of respiratory problems they did an x-ray and he was diagnosed with advanced cancer and that s not the only case
i strongly urge the health and social services to do a better job in taking care of the patients possibly by x-raying more of the patients and doing more examinations on their patients
mr chairman i would like to bring up one issue particularly about children in the gjoa haven
little children are put to sleep when they re going to be getting their teeth extracted in yellowknife or hay river
when we set up the nunavut government will still send dental patients outside of the nunavut area or are we going to be getting proper dentists services set up in the region
i don t know what it s like in the keewatin or baffin but our dental patients children especially are going outside of our region if they need to be anaesthetised and have their teeth extracted
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
minister of health and social services
if you would like to respond please
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
the member brings up a couple of very interesting concerns on cancer again
i guess cancer is assiduous
there are pre-screening that happens right now for cancer that we re aware of
for example on a regular basis women receive pap-smears and that s a way in indicating for cervical cancers which are being on the rise
there is self-examination for breast cancers but to actually have the test in place the test for different kinds of cancers on a regular basis
no i m not aware of any jurisdiction that does that
i guess the best solution to stopping cancers that are most prevalent in the north would be to stop smoking lung cancer is a big problem and some of the other cancers that we have
we realize and i realize this is a major concern
your chances of survival were very small indeed those days are gone and most cancers today if detected early enough there is a very good percentage of patients that have survived
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
deputy minister macrury
mr macrury
on the issue of childhood very young children can have major extractions if necessary
our major initiative in the department will be to launch preventive programs to try and prevent these early teeth being destroyed by the consumption of sugary liquids usually
it is mostly caused by children going to bed with a bottle in their mouth which has milk or tang or some sweetened liquid in it
then usually what happens is the second teeth come in and they have a lot of problems with them
they come in crooked and one under the other and there is a lot of problems with those
so our main approach to dealing with this issue is from a preventive approach and we want to launch major prevention activities through health education at the nursing centres to try and promote health teeth in young children
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr puqiqnak supplementary question
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
thank you for the response
yes i can recall in the kitikmeot area people used to come in dentists used to come into our communities to extract children s teeth and the child would be put under anaesthesia in order to get their teeth extracted
a lot of children had their teeth extracted just in the kitikmeot alone
when a child s teeth had been extracted you feel for the little children because they don t have any teeth left then when their teeth are newly extracted there is no follow up
their teeth are taken out and then they are left there is no after care treatment no follow up care given to these children
their teeth are extracted and then they are left
do you do follow up care on children who have had to have a lot of their teeth extracted or is there any follow up treatment
chairperson interpretation thank you
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the member makes a good point
indeed as mr macrury has said one of the things that we are trying to do in this department is a new philosophical view of health in nunavut is to look at the preventive side of medicine
but that won t be for a while yet
on the follow up indeed there is follow up done
so there is follow up done i understand by the department
i guess that s not fair
an interesting side note to this is just recently i had written an article for a magazine on how traditionally in newfoundland people dealt with problems with teeth and toothaches using tooth charmers
a person would go forward to the tooth charmer and the tooth charmer would say a special little prayer and away went the toothache
i just did an article on this so i am quite interested in teeth and teeth problems
just a little story for you mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister of health and social services
we ll take a break at this time because i think that some of us have fallen asleep
we will take a fifteen minute health break
it takes us a little while to get back to our seats even though we are anticipating the completion of the budgets
>>committee recessed at 3 07 and resumed at 3 35 p m
chairperson interpretation
please return to your seats
we have pages here can the pages go get the members from upstairs
i think we can resume
we ll just start off because we are running late
mr puqiqnak if you still have comments you still have time to proceed
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i know that our minister is well aware of the fact of the population growth in the communities of nunavut
especially when there is still some ice around and when you can t access the communities from the outpost camps
not only in gjoa haven experiences that problem because campers can t get back to their communities
when one get ill in the camps they have to be medivaced by helicopter at times
sometimes there is no other means of getting a patient from the outpost camp other than by helicopter and they cannot use airplanes
i have seen this myself
in our area it usually happens when there are families camping out for a few weeks
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
either one of you the minister or his official can respond
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the member brings up a very interesting point
indeed as a department one of the things that we are trying to do right now is look at a comprehensive medical travel study
this would include medivacs and indeed looking at what the requirements are when people are in camps
now again that depends on operational requirements if there is no helicopter available that could get into position we would have to look at other avenues to get that person the attention that they need
we might have to look at getting someone in by some other means
that is part of the comprehensive medical travel study that we are doing and that we are looking at
hopefully over the next several months as we look at this issue there are so many issues in the department of health that we are trying to look at for the residents of nunavut and it takes time
a lot of the departments mr chairman aren t up to staff yet and i realize that in the department of health we are one of those departments
our staff my staff have been putting in a lot of hours trying to do trying to meet the operational requirements and this is one of the things that we are trying to review thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister of health & social services
i just want to further point out that during breaks we should try and get back on time so that we can complete the budgets for the departments
i think we should all try and come back after our break on time
mr puqiqnak are you finished
thank you
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i will ask a question in regards to the baffin region patients sent down to ottawa especially from the baffin region
mostly the patients stay at the hostel and they are concerned about elders
so my question is what s the status with the ottawa patients
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman mr chairman the member makes a good point
indeed i have had that situation with a member of my family who went down without an escort and it was a bit of a problem
based on operational requirements
i will also be visiting the rotel in july to see the situation there with the rotel as the minister of health
i think we are pretty confident in the way that is being applied
when the health services first transferred from montreal to ottawa we had more concerns there were some problems at that time with the development of the services provided by osgoode
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr akesuk do you have any further questions
thank you
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i said i had my hand up when we were talking about tooth extraction but i didn t get to hear his last comment
chairperson interpretation
what is your question
i think that was just a comment i still didn t understand what you said
could you rephrase your question
mr nutarak interpretation
when we were talking about teeth i just wanted to say as a joke but i just let it go ahead that since my last name is nutarak child am i going to get nutarak teeth
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to ask a question in regards to the boarding home in yellowknife
i am sure you are responsible for the yellowknife patient home sometimes the patient home is filled to capacity and the patients who have no room in the boarding home have to find other means of accommodation
my question is how do you take care of the patients that have to stay elsewhere
what are your plans mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr minister or your officials can respond
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
indeed there is also home boarding available to the folks in the kitikmeot region going to yellowknife patients that come over can actually board with families similar to the way it is here in iqaluit
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i am going to ask a question in regards to the boarding homes that don t have co-ordinators or directors who understand inuktitut especially the elders
this is a problem in the boarding homes especially when the elders have to go there and the directors or the staff in the boarding homes cannot read and write in inuktitut
i would like to see some co-ordinators or directors of the boarding homes to be bilingual thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the member makes a very good point
if we have unilingual people going to yellowknife or ottawa or indeed winnipeg that as a department we ensure that the services are available in inuktitut and that we have qualified translators and interpreters available
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in regards to elders not being able to access interpreters i believe that fact because from gjoa haven there was an elder who was sent to yellowknife who did not have an escort or interpreter
i felt that at the yellowknife airport that person was waiting for a very very long time and he was stuck and didn t know what to do and nobody knew that he was at the airport as a patient
i urge you to ensure that the elders be escorted or have interpreters when they have to be treated outside of their home community
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr minister
i think that was more of a comment or would you like to respond
thank you
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister for your appropriate answer
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman as the minister is aware we are unlike the other regions of canada and there are various types of illnesses and diseases that we are effected by here in the north and particularly nunavut
i am just wondering what type of wide spread studies is the minister conducting now or looking at conducting as they relate to epidemiology
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr minister or your officials can respond to him
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the member raises a very good area of concern of ours at the department of health for nunavut
epidemiology and indeed the epidemiologist is a very rare field it is very hard to hire epidemiologists
we are fortunate that we will be having an epidemiologist working on staff
indeed the person just finished a university degree right now and indeed tomorrow our chief medical officer for nunavut will be in place and our assistant chief medical officer some time after that
we want to be able to look at all the health characteristics of nunavut specifically
in the past just a short six weeks ago before april 1st we were part of the northwest territories and there was an epidemiologist on staff with that department
indeed the government of the northwest territories had problems finding epidemiologists to look at the field of epidemiology
so that matter is being looked into and indeed epidemiology is a very complex area of medical science and we will have an epidemiologist in place very shortly
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
it takes a while for you to respond to some members
we have to proceed with business here your officials can respond if you don t know the answer
mr o brien do you have any further questions or comments
proceed
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
just one other question and i think it is a question that concerns all the members here
i am curious as to how the minister is going to incorporate the inuit qaujimajatuqangit factor with the reduction of trimethane in the home
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr minister of health & social services
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
so i am trying to with your support mr chairman give the members of this house the explanations i know the answers i gave the proper answer on epidemiology indeed epidemiologists
for example with custom adoptions we are using inuit qaujimajatuqangit
as i said earlier mr chairman with mental health we are looking at ways of using inuit qaujimajatuqangit
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr o brien do you have any further questions
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr minister for that answer
just going back to my earlier question about epidemiology my question was what wide spread studies is the minister looking at what type of issues and concerns is he going to apply this to
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman as the member probably knows and is aware every month most members previously used to receive a copy of the epi-north newsletter which is put out by the gnwt
i see that the member has a copy of the newsletter with him
mr macrury
mr chairman one of the interesting aspects of the study of diseases or epidemiology in nunavut has come about when we attempted to separate out the health statistics from the general nwt information that was available
we have identified that there are studies required in several of the things that have been talked about here already today
cancer is one of the things we have a different characteristics of cancer infections in nunavut from the nwt and perhaps from other jurisdictions in canada
so we are going to be looking at that
we have different characteristics in the pre-natal and post-natal disease pattern in children
so we are going to be looking at some of those issues
we are going to be looking at various other characteristics around stomach complaints that have to be looked at
so there are a broad range of issues that are different than they are in other jurisdictions and those are some of the things that we will be looking at
right now we are in the process of identifying just what area we have to do those studies
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr macrury
mr o brien do you have another question
mr o brien
yes just one follow up point to this issue
would you also be looking at the increase of tb in nunavut
thank you
mr macrury
yes mr chairman we have identified tb as a major concern
we are in fact working on this right now there has been a significant level of activity with tb in most of the communities in baffin and some of the communities in the other two regions
as a department we have reserved some money that we can allocate to special needs of the boards and we will look at that later in the context of the budget
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr macrury
please recognize the chairperson before speaking
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i have been sitting so long it seems like it is time to get up
mr chairman earlier it had asked about the plans for the department in the future to deal with some of the problems that we are facing
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister of health or your official
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
as the members know there are several different changes that we would like to do in the department of health
one of them we have announced is the elimination of the health boards
mr dave ramsden is working on that process right now and how we will deliver health & social services after march 2000
i don t know if mr macrury would like to add anything to that
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr macrury would you like to make a supplementary response
mr macrury
the major change that we want to see in the department that we will be exploring over the short term is in ways that we can move the department into more prevention and promotion of health mode
at the same time dealing with the acute care cases have to be addressed but in reality trying to move more in that direction of prevention and promotion
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr macrury
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman indeed with the take over for example of child and social services by the health board is actually following the direction of the department of health where we have talked about the holistic approach
they are actually in lockstep with us on the delivery of those services
so yes the short answer mr chairman is yes the department of health for nunavut is looking at a holistic and complete approach for the delivery side of health and social services
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo do you have a supplementary question
mr tootoo
yes thank you mr chairman
just a suggestion i would urge that throughout the last few months i know in my constituency and also in the ministers there are numerous health care providers residing here
i would urge strongly that the department approach those people as well and not leave them out of this process
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i think all members know and realize that as we started off this government on april 1 the expectations of our staff are very high
as we are trying to get up to capacity as a government there has been so much demand put on our staff hours and hours of time worked
indeed we do have i think it is safe to say some problems with morale
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr picco
mr tootoo i believe that you have another comment or question
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i know that in any field it is usually the people that are working in the field that have the best ideas on how the system runs and they have to work in it
so they are the ones that know how best to maybe accommodate some of these changes that need to be faced
that s more what i was referring to
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon ed picco
take a proactive stance on the way health & social services is delivered
not only at the regional level but at the local and community level and indeed nunavut wide
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
at this moment i ran out of names on my list if there are no more questions
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i received a letter from my constituency just recently in respect to the health people in our community
people have talked about the human resources and about the female/male staff
when we want to look at equality whether they are male or female i know this has been dealt with for a while now and since we have nunavut i think more accommodations can be made towards this
could we ask if an individual is women or not to me it effects me deeply
i agree with women i grew up with women
i know they are very skilled they are very independent
as nunavut residents it doesn t really make sense that we don t have equality we have to pursue equality and this concept now just in our communities this has probably been an issue dealt with by the department of justice
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
mr minister or your officials if you want to add anything to that
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
i understand the member and i agree that we need equality
not just among the sexes but among the races the people of nunavut i think that as a government that is what we are striving towards
as a department that is what we are trying to strive towards
i appreciate the members comments
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr puqiqnak
supplementary
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in kitikmeot in the former government in respect to the boarding home
i want to ask maybe more on this later but i believe i have asked you this question in respect to lena pederson and the contract on the boarding home
with respect to lena pederson back in the 70 s or 80 s the boarding home was opened
back then the contract was awarded to an inuit firm and to date this contract is outside of nunavut
this is an interest now being taken on by my constituents in respect to article 24 and 23 in the land claims agreement
in view of that and this being within nunavut i believe that this contract should be taken by a firm within nunavut
how have you been effected by this within your department
that is my question
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
minister of health do you wish to respond
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i just want to say that on the lena pederson boarding home contract in yellowknife it was prior to april 1 and it was signed off by the then health minister for the previous nwt government
after april 1 and becoming the minister of health i was requested to review the award of that contract and indeed to look at specific arrangements under article 24
that information was provided to me and indeed we provided it to the people that asked
we are also right now in the middle i believe of responding to a similar query from nti on the applicability of article 24
all of that information has been forthcoming to the people who questioned the contract and has been made available by the nwt government as signed off by that former health minister person in that previous government prior to 1999
thank you mr chairman i hope that answer the question
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
any further comments mr puqiqnak
thank you
at this time i don t have any more names on my list for comments or questions
i think we can move on to the finances
mr akesuk do you have a comment
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you
i didn t finish with my question just a supplementary
maybe just ten more questions
at the moment people aren t able to have easy access to the office
what is being done or what plans are there for this area
that is my question thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr minister of health sometimes it will be confusing who will be asking you questions but do you have a response
hon ed picco
thank you mr iqaqrialu you are doing a very good job today
thank you mr chairman i just caught the last piece of what mr akesuk was asking because i was being advised on the epidemiology situation with mr o brien in my ear
i am wondering if mr akesuk could just succinctly repeat his question for expediency
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr akesuk could you rephrase your question
mr akesuk
i don t know if you have the epidemiology problem or not in your ear so thank you mr chairman
interpretation my question first is with respect to back in montreal the office was just below the boarding home
in ottawa there is no easy access to the office
the patients don t have easy access so i was just wondering whether the health office would be relocated and be more accessible to the boarding home and the patients
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
we are very fortunate today to have with us mr ken macrury who is a former ceo of the hospital and indeed of the baffin regional health & social services board for many years
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
go ahead
mr macrury
thank you mr chairman
if i might remind the member from the baffin in the montreal situation where we had baffin house the actual baffin regional health board ran the boarding house
it was staffed and operated by staff of the baffin board and the only thing that we were purchasing in montreal was the health care
we purchased the health care from the mcgill program operating in several hospitals in montreal
when we made a decision to transfer the services from montreal to ottawa one of the fundamental differences was we wanted the ottawa providers to provide a comprehensive service
so as soon as the patient gets off the plane in montreal they are then the responsibility of the service provider
so they provide the boarding they provide the translation services they provide the transportation and they provide the health care
i think that there is a fundamental difference there that the people on the baffin regional health board wanted to see
so one of the differences was is that it is not supposed to replicate the montreal service thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr macrury
mr akesuk do you have a further question
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i think my question would be are we going to be asking what the general consensus is on this issue in nunavut
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr minister do you wish to add anything
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
the member brings up a good point and that is one of the reasons why we are actually going to ottawa to look at the operation and the rotel
i will be doing that in july and indeed i think i mentioned this one to look at the nunasi corporations building larga homes
what nunasi is recommending to us is that their larga home for unilingual people to have it staffed with inuit employees and provide interpreting/translating have inuit food there and so on
that appeals to me i think it is a good way of looking at things but i haven t seen the facility or anything like that
the contract we have right now is in place it is with osney and we have been accessing the rotel
where it hasn t met all of our needs i think it is fair to say it has come a long way since last year when we first started using them
there are some things that could be maybe made a little bit better and maybe a bit more conducive to unilingual people elderly people and so on
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr akesuk any more
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
my last question in respect to patients who have no escorts or who were not provided escorts
when they go in the hospital although they are just unilingual you don t have any interpreters provided or interpreters are not provided right away what are you going to do about it
chairperson interpretation
but you want to add anything further mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you
no you re correct mr chairman
that is what i m looking at and making more conducive for nunavut people needs
we understand the difficulty and i should maybe just point out very quickly
so on and so forth
same thing with us mr chairman
when we have unilingual people we have to send them to ottawa
we want to make sure that that in no way is problematic to them because they are residents of nunavut and we have rights as individuals and indeed as a government to make sure that people are treated fairly
that my friend that is what we re trying to do as a department so i can ensure the member that we are reviewing that to make sure that our citizens are treated properly especially elderly people
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr akesuk
any more
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman thank you
i just have one question in respect to health centres in communities
that is my question
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr minister any response
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i was speaking to the deputy minister concerning the review of capital projects
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
there is a hospital in iqaluit i don t know what year it was built and we were told that if there is any money available that you would do an extension on that hospital or make a new one
it has been a hospital for twenty years now
do you have any kind of regulations on hospitals and health centres where they have to get renovated or you have to build a new one within a certain time frame
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the member makes a couple of good points
as we know in 1988 northwest territories took over health from the federal government
up to that time the canadian government built and maintained all facilities in nunavut
and they built some new facilities
since that time over the last ten years it became the responsibility of the government of the northwest territories
and as we know as a government we don t really have the money now within our capital budget to build new facilities
and indeed in my capital budget today we only have two point one million dollars
which is basically for minor renovations and code violations and so on
where do we find the money to do those types of things
the baffin hospital mr chairman was built in 1962 was built for a population when iqaluit was probably fifteen hundred to two thousand people
today that population has tripled and they re serving a region of nunavut that has tripled
the need is for a new hospital that s recognized again we don t have the money for it so we have to do a p3 process
i can assure the member that one of my priorities as a minister is to make sure that we look at the facility in pond inlet
because i am aware of that facility and indeed we need to do some work there
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
jobie nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation

when i m looking at the salary dollars here that s within the department of health and social services

the health boards is another page with maybe on 10-7 and so the member would like to hold that question on wages and benefits
health board monies that we give them is where we would find that line

detail of grants and contributions
mr tootoo mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman looking at all these grants and contributions its looks like it s funding toward the regional boards i m wondering mr chairman if we could ask the boards for a little bit of a more detail
if the minister could ask the board to provide us with a bit of a detail of in each of those areas
what the dollars are being used for
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you
just for clarification purposes there is no capital in the detail of grants and contributions to the boards
i m wondering if the members requesting for example if we use primary and acute care
thank you mr chairman chairperson interpretation
go ahead mr tootoo
it doesn t have to be right now it can be provided at a future point and time
that would be fine
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation

>>mr puqiqnak takes the chair
chairperson interpretation

mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the minister was speaking earlier about epidemiology and i believe his deputy minister mentioned the publication epic-north
i am just wondering if the minister is going to give some consideration to having an epic-nunavut or are we still going to be part of the epic north documentation that surfaces once every three months
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman over the past three years i have been an avid reader of the monthly epi- north
so i would commit right now that over the next several months that we would have our own epi nunavut magazine that i say magazine it is not a magazine it is a four page newsletter
kevin has one in his hand right now
so yes mr chairman i commit to putting out that and maybe i would have an opportunity to have an editorial page in there for the members to read
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
i would like to thank the minister for his enlightening comments and i hope that the editorial that he writes will also have a photograph of the minister
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien mr minister
hon ed picco why yes mr chairman i would make sure that indeed i would be there and probably with the guy who will replace me or the guy i replaced i think it would be fitting
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman if we look at the child family and special services section
what does it mean there is 2 1 million here what kind of services are we talking about under this particular heading
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr minister picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i would like to ask the assistant deputy minister maybe to elaborate a little more on the specifics of the children s programs and services
on the members question on the 2 1 million i don t see that figure here could the member clarify if he is on 10 - 8
thank you
chairperson interpretation
assistant deputy minister ms cooper
ms cooper interpretation
if we look at number 12 and if we go back to number 11 it gives you further details on monies that are geared towards children
wellness and adoption
that s what these monies are used for
chairperson interpretation
thank you ms cooper
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman i have yet to see specialized services that are geared towards child and family special needs
i am not quite sure what these services include
when we say adoption are their transportation expenses paid for by the department of health & social services if they are going to be adopting
chairperson interpretation
mr minister are you going to respond to that question
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman ms cooper the assistant deputy minister will try to clarify the members question
thank you
chairperson interpretation
assistant deputy minister ms cooper
ms cooper interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in regards to children for example if you have a concern regarding a child s need for a healthy lifestyle we have identified here that services can be provided
can we ask questions while we re sitting here
chairperson interpretation
maybe i can ask the member if he s concerned about money that s allocated for the children
that s under this is going to be utilized for children s services
it s not to be allotted to the communities
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu
thank you mr chairman
yes i understand a bit what it is for but i still don t understand this time what it is exactly why the doctors who get the funds rather than the children for children s services
chairperson interpretation thank you mr iqaqrialu
you can either respond to it yourself hon ed picco
mr chairman i believe under details grants and contribution 2-1
when we mention children that s only one small part of it
when we are trying to explain what the money was used for
for example if i had an adopted child with mental problems or psychiatric problems i would use the services at the health board for counselling that would be covered under there for example
of course the cost of bringing my adoptive child if they were from pangnirtung or clyde river back and forth to iqaluit to see the psychologist that would be covered under there
so it were be geared towards social services as an example
i don t know if that helps but maybe explain why the amount is there but it s a multi-faceted component
mr chairman thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu do you have any further comments or questions
mr iqaqrialu
i still don t understand
like children s programs
are we talking about family allowances
chairperson interpretation
what kinds of children s programs are you talking about in there
hon ed picco
thank you
maybe the words are a bit misleading when we say children s programs it just a type of it just a word that we re using to explain the process here for that line item
maybe the program verbiage is the wrong verbiage to use in this case
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
the first one is 2 million 100 thousand for the one you just answered me with children s programs i thought was that was in the upper one
i think we have to explain what this is for according to your response it s not for actual children themselves the upper one is for the children but under children s programs i think that the headings should change
i think it should not be children s programs that way it ll be a lot clearer to understand
i don t understand it
chairperson
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
again maybe it s the verb that it s been used i ll try to explain it this way
when we talk about 2 1 million under child family and special need services that s basically mental health for children across nunavut
everyone in the three regions that s what that s for
when we talked about children s programs which is 3 2 that david has just been talking about that was for children in care
this is for children who might be foster children or they were in abusive relationships or they are being taken care of by this government or maybe in the south and paid for by this government
again three regions divide it i think the problem here is in the verb
we said it s being used this money goes directly to the health boards and they use it
i mean i had to stay personally i had a foster child who s under one of these programs so i know a little bit about how it worked
so i don t know if that explains it there s no mystery here as david is correct the use of verbiage the words that are used to explain maybe they are not clear as it could be or as concise
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr picco
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
now i understand what it contains
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you
i have only one name on the list now
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
i ll be brief in my comments
if there s any studies as to what can be done to prevent it
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson epidemiology is the study of skin and i know that i m not a skin expert mr chairperson
there are different reasons of course for rashes and so on again in the budget for this department there s no detail on if we re studying skin rashes in the communities in particular
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr picco
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
that s hard to match mr picco
on a more serious note i m still curious is there any research being done on the some of the problems that some young children do have
we ve noticed this in some of the communities for years
we should be looking at some preventative measures about what causes this instead of just accepting it
thank you mr picco any rashes that i may have or come upon i ll leave it at that
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairman i thank the member for his earlier question indeed sometimes after this process we sometimes have to have a little levity and i appreciate that
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr picco
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
under 9 million 575 thousand the heading starts with the community health programs
the translation literally states that the community in order to have healthy communities
is that a fact are we going to provide this service so that there could be healthier communities is that what the fund is for
maybe perhaps you could explain what the community health program is
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson the member is very observant we just caught a typo in the documents indeed that s not what community health programs is community wellness is there so the member has very sharp eyes he is correct
again we re looking at programs done at the community health level for example alcohol education programs programs to inform the residents of nunavut about the dangers of the consumption of alcohol for example fas or fae awareness programs
community awareness programs on specific issues the member s correct it is not lying here that 9 575 million is not for community wellness
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr picco
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
yes this program 9 million the inuktitut version is different from the way you responded to me
so it s quite similar to the program we had earlier the community wellness program
if this program is going to be allotted is this fund going to be made available through applications or is it going to be just allotted to the communities or the boards
thank you chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairperson
according to translation i think to 10 or 11 to community wellness so maybe that s what we should have been referring to
under this one this 9 575 for example they d run the spousal assault homes for family violence programs
that s what is covered on this when we say community health programs
for example that s how we fund them and again it s nunavut wide that s not specific to one region i don t know if that makes it more clear
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr picco
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i don t know what date it was during our session
we discussed the women s shelter
i think we have to have good general direction for this
i hope this money will be used for shelters and things like that
i ll just conclude with that mr chairperson
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
i think that was more of a comment than a question
i would like to get back to the main estimates
on page 10-10 detail of grants and contributions
that s just an information item
going to 10-11 detail of work performed on behalf of third parties
some members

chairperson interpretation

thank you mr chairperson
>>applause
chairperson interpretation

mr picco s department is completed

>>committee recessed at 5 01 and resumed at 5 12 pm
chairperson interpretation

mr akesuk
mr akesuk
thank you mr chairperson
what i would like to say right now is i would like to hear the opening comments by the minister of the department and also get the committee report read in
then we can ask our questions and make general comments tomorrow mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
so let s clarify that because we have only 1 hour
mr akesuk are you making a motion to go ahead
mr akesuk interpretation
yes i move that we deal with the opening remarks by the minister of education
chairperson interpretation
is there a seconder for the motion
he doesn t need a seconder
those in favour of the motion
the motion is carried
let s move on to the department of education then and the minister of education can make his opening remarks
opening comments for the department of education 1999-2000 main estimates
hon james arvaluk interpretation
i have to take my glasses off because i use them as hearing aids
mr chairman our staff was not readily available but i think it won t be too difficult to deal with this department
mr chairman i am pleased to present the main estimates for the department of education for the fiscal year 1999/2000
the department provides services in three areas
early childhood and school services
adult education and post secondary services
and income support
mr chairman because of my personal and historic perspective of the need for quality educational opportunities for all the people of nunavut i am grateful to the premier for assigning me to this portfolio
i have a great interest in education and a genuine desire to serve nunavummiut
i am committed to make this department representative accountable and productive in its mandate
our mission is to provide excellence in education and training opportunities that will give all nunavummiut the opportunity to learn so that they may benefit from their past and create their own futures
this will help nunavummiut in achieving personal fulfilment and becoming a productive and prosperous society
to achieve this the department uses a network of publicly funded and supported day-care centres in many communities
support to schools through funding to divisional education councils
a network of community learning centres and regional campuses funded through nunavut arctic college
the department also funds regional education offices that provide educational and training opportunities as well as income support services to the public
the budget before you is a status quo budget
it maintains existing programs and services
through reorganization of existing resources we will be able to streamline our operations in time
mr chairman the department of education budget for the 1999-2000 fiscal year totals 138 6 million
this includes 21 4 million for adult education and post secondary 87 6 million for early childhood and school services and regional operations 26 1 million for income support programs and 6 4 million for capital expenditures
mr chairman the following are highlights from this year s budget
mr chairman the income support program makes up 19% of the department s budget
we need to find solutions to reduce the numbers of individuals and families who rely on this funding
my department and my colleague from sustainable development will be looking at this program this year to find ways to reducing the dependency up on income support
capital spending this year is not at the level that was originally prepare under the gnwt 5-year capital plan
to meet budget objectives the department used the following criteria
projects that were already under constructionprojects that had a legal commitmentprojects wit a health or safety issue
not all projects were able to go forward this year
the department is planning to do a capital plan stud that will address the long-term needs of our communities
decentralization initiatives will produce the following results
i have a small headquarters team to manage all program areas
it is small because we have a commitment to decentralization and when fully functional will be located in three communities
iqaluit with 26 persons arviat with 29 persons and baker lake with 4
we have staff in arviat now
however the office space is not ready for them and some are currently working out of their homes
the education regional office in iqaluit will move to pangnirtung when the new office building is completed in the spring/summer of 2000
this will move 22 positions to pangnirtung
the income support positions are not included in this number
nunavut arctic college head office will be moving to rankin inlet in the fall of this year pending budget
this will transfer 11 5 positions to that community
with the restructuring of the three divisional education councils
education will still maintain a regional presence
this restructuring will be detailed over the next months in the forthcoming implementation plan
at a recent meeting of the nunavut arctic college board of governors a decision was made to review the structure of the college
any restructuring will be done within the college s existing resources
this activity will bring the college closer to the people it serves
the college is an important component in the delivery of services to residents
the department is supportive of this restructuring and looks forward to working with the college as it shapes itself to fulfil its mandate and the mandate of the nunavut government mandate in the delivery of education and training opportunities
mr chairman the are still challenges ahead
increasing the number of inuit throughout the department is or number one focus
we are in fair shape at this time as of december 1998 there were 131 inuit teachers and 115 aboriginal language specialists on the teaching staff of schools out of a total of 665 or 37% inuit employment
at our headquarters inuit currently hold 7 of the 12 positions filled or 58% inuit employment
mr chairman the department is committed to the concept of inuit qaujimajatuqangit
as we increase the number of inuit teachers in our schools and as new curricula are developed based on inuit qaujimajatuqangit this will ensure that our children grow up knowing who they are
i was pleased to note mr chairman that any of the recent graduates of the aboriginal language specialist program are elders from arviat
this is indeed good news
elders are receiving recognition and will make a valuable contribution to our schools and to our children
mr chairman i have challenged my staff to take a leadership role in this government
i have challenged them to deliver programs and services to citizens can benefit from their pasts and crate their own futures
i have challenged them to find ways to allow the citizens of nunavut to achieve personal fulfilment and to promote a productive and prosperous society
thank you mr chairman
>>applause
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister of education for nunavut
we will now go ahead with the committee report regarding education
mr nutarak this is your committees department
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
i think mr puqiqnak was going to do the opening remarks
chairperson interpretation
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i don t have the inuktitut copy of the report from the committee
okay mr o brien i think is going to be reading the opening remarks from the committee or motions
you can go ahead if you are going to be reading the motions
report of the standing committee on culture education and health
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
i will ask the members and the staff to bear with me i will try to summarize where i can
the honourable james arvaluk minister of education and departmental officials met with the standing committee on may 1 1999
the minister spoke eloquently about his hopes for the new government of nunavut and for his department
the standing committee appreciated the preparation by the minister and his department which was evident at our meeting
the members thanked him for being so open and look forward to a good working relationship with him and his staff
business plan/ operations/ programs
the department of education has an o&m budget of $132 132 487 of which $122 799 000 is grants and contributions to other levels for delivery of education programs early childhood programs adult education and income support
inuit leadership in education
the standing committee reviewed the draft business plan and commends the department of education for having the most ambitious and concrete inuit employment plan
this department has through its ntep and other programs been able to achieve 34% inuit teachers and 4 out of 42 school principals are inuit
they want to be at 84% inuit elementary schools and adult educator positions in 3 years
the standing committee was deeply impressed with this department s focus on inuit leadership in their business plan and their track record in this regard
members agree that teachers play a pivotal role in every community and have a huge influence on our children
inuit teachers especially those who were born here in nunavut and who know the people and the land are important role models ensuring that inuit culture and language is imparted to our students
they are the foundation of our land and of passing on traditional knowledge to our students
they are also community leaders and provide stability in our communities
the more inuit community teachers the less recruitment needed from the south and the less we will face difficulties in this regard
the more inuit teachers who move into management training and curriculum development the more culturally appropriate the whole education system
the standing committee supports the minister and the department of education for their inuit leadership plans
the minister noted that at present inuit teachers are almost entirely in the primary schools
therefore in addition to the current ntep programs that will continue to be run through nunavut arctic college the minister presented several enhancement programs which his department would run if more resources were available
this department has concrete plans a proven track record of delivery critically important jobs at the community level inuit employment possibilities and a direct link to ensuring inuit qaujimajatuqangit is incorporated into their curriculum and programs
cabinet decision to abolish the regional education boards
the standing committee briefly reviewed information on the cabinet decision to abolish the regional education boards
there were small charts projecting savings but no details on how those numbers were generated
there will be more accountability to the elected minister but no complaints procedure was presented
members wondered if the department will create an ombudsman type of person to co-ordinate and streamline complaints to the minister
members are very concerned that this change in structure not lay the foundation for the department in iqaluit to take control away from the communities and the regions regarding education
members do not want iqaluit to in effect become another yellowknife with decisions made by officials far away from the community
will hamlets be given a position on the deas or will the membership of the deas be altered in any way
what will be the checks and balances in this new system for individuals and communities with respect to their deas and the department
how does this affect the department s commitment to decentralization
members also wondered whether adult education programs would also be brought into the department
the standing committee therefore looks forward to receiving the draft legislation and reviewing more complete implementation plans at that time
formula for funding
standing committee members were advised that a formula inherited from the gnwt will influence the allocation of funding to each district education council for this fiscal year
however only a bulk number was given for each region and no further detail was provided
the department did provide more detailed hard-copy information with complete break-downs of programs to our committee members but before the committee could study it finance officials instructed that they be removed from our binders
this was a source of frustration to members as noted above
members requested detailed information on the formula for funding by community for schools pre-school programs and arctic college and department committed to provide an analysis of the formula
stay in school programs/ support for people who did not complete high school
standing committee members noted that there are many people who have not completed their high school and sometimes these people are on social assistance
they wondered what short and longer term plans the department had to stop people from dropping out of school
at the same time members also observed that sometimes people who may not have a lot of formal education have excellent skills as a welder or mechanic or have traditional skills
they wondered why more of these people in their communities are not hired by arctic college to instruct courses in their home communities to unilingual inuit
members also want to encourage trades training to students who have not completed their high school diploma
the minister responded that the department will be trying many new methods to encourage people to stay in school
he also stated that there will be arctic college programs designed to encourage productive choices for people on income assistance and that an inventory would be created of people in nunavut who are knowledgeable in different fields
the minister noted that his department was very open to reviewing the school calendar year so that it would conform more to the inuit lifestyle and agreed that it might have a positive effect on keeping students in school
he also asked the members for their advice as to what sort of directive should be given to parents about their role in keeping children in school
the standing committee members look forward to reviewing these issues and programs in the future
adult education programs
in follow-up discussions the standing committee expressed concerns about the success rates of arctic college students and programs
they would like to receive information on how many students are completing the arctic college programs and how many are getting jobs in their areas of training following graduation
members are aware of the difficulties facing families that relocate to the regional centres to take programs such as obtaining adequate housing and know that many students return to their communities before they complete their programs
they would like to see more information on the benefits in running programs in communities including more on the job training programs
at the same time members want to ensure that those students who wish to pursue post-secondary programs in southern universities and colleges are encouraged and supported
nunavut may not be able to run some of these specialized programs at this time
curriculum
standing committee members welcomed the announcement by the department that they will have a 10-year curriculum development plan which will be revised on an annual basis
the department also noted that they would be working with language specialists with cley in developing materials and that materials would be provided to the community teacher learning centres
members know that the department of education has developed curriculum in the past that has had a strong cultural component such as inuuqatigiit and look forward to these new developments
some concern was expressed about the need to incorporate different dialects into the curriculum development or to support local communities to adapt materials to their dialect
members are also very supportive of inuktitut language training at all levels [k-12 arctic college workplace] both to inuit and non-inuit
they want these language programs widely available
as noted above members want to encourage all dialects to be promoted preserved and taught
the standing committee members look forward to hearing more about these initiatives in the future and note that the minister stated that the curriculum changes would have to be approved by the legislative assembly
as noted above members want to encourage elders to play more of a role in the schools and they observed that the department of cley does not seem to have funds for this function
he noted that cbc and ibc also have important footage of our elders and even jurisdictions outside of nunavut have this information
he noted that next february the department would be looking at this and members look forward to hearing more about these ideas
children with special needs/ pre-school children
members of the standing committee had specific questions regarding the government of nunavut s plans for providing pre-school programs and for supporting children with special needs
the minister noted that his department will be looking at these programs more in the future and members look forward to hearing more about these when information becomes available
capital plan
there are 13 projects planned for a total value of $6 451 000
the standing committee reviewed the departments commitments for capital expenditures during this fiscal year very briefly as members did not receive the details or inuktitut versions in time for our pre-meeting preparation
however members thank the department for providing inuktitut information at the time of the presentation
the standing committee was frustrated at not being able to play more of a role in reviewing these capital proposals and had questions about priorities
for example how a $250 000 link between two buildings in one community could have priority over additional space needs for classrooms in another community
the standing committee welcomed the department s commitment to five year and even longer term [20 year] capital planning
members wondered how each of their communities fit into the plan
it was unclear as to the status of the gnwt five-year plan in which some communities could have expected capital projects in the near future
members observed that there are no capital projects planned for kivalliq this year and concerns were expressed about outstanding safety and health issues affecting schools in clyde river and gjoa haven
members welcomed a commitment from the minister to involve them in the development of the capital plan in future and his statement that information would be shared with mla s in order to have an open dialogue
the committee would also like to encourage the department to conduct an audit of what facilities are in each community
this idea was presented by the department of health and social services and the standing committee supports it for all capital facilities
members would like to know when schools were built or had additions their overall condition and how much was spent
members would also like details as to what specific facilities there are in each school - for example number of classrooms size of gymnasium library specialized rooms or equipment etc
a question that needs to be answered is
what is the minimum threshold that each community should have in facilities for their students
while some of these requirements may depend on the number of children in a community members want to ensure that all smaller communities have basic facilities before any additional facilities are put into the larger regional centres
equitable principles need to be developed to make these decisions
the department also noted that forced growth and demographic projections in some communities will influence the needs of some communities and the standing committee would like to receive more information about this as it is available

ministers statement 27 - 1 2 nunavut business incentive policy
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i rise today to provide clarification to both the members and the nunavut business community with respect to the nunavut business incentive policy
mr speaker you will note that i called it the nunavut business incentive policy for it applies to nunavut businesses only
this policy is applied specifically to the nunavut territory only
interpretation ends
mr speaker i believe that this will help create new possibilities within the nunavut area which may not have been considered viable previously
under the original business incentive policy there were instances where nunavut businesses were unable to compete directly with the well established businesses in both yellowknife and the western part of the territories
it is my belief that the nunavut business incentive policy will help level the playing field and create potential in such areas as small scale manufacturing and industry
there will be opportunities for nunavut businesses to fill the gaps which were once filled by businesses from the rest of the northwest territories where operating costs were in some cases much lower
mr speaker this creates additional opportunities in our communities which may not have been previously viable
the original business incentive policy was established by the government of nwt in 1984
the principle function of this policy was to enable northern firms to compete on an equal footing with southern firms in bidding for goods and services in the north
the high cost of maintaining a business in the north made this a necessity
mr speaker by adopting the nunavut business incentive policy our intent is to assist nunavut businesses to develop and grow
this is a very important factor in ensuring that doing business within nunavut benefits the people of nunavut
mr speaker this will result in increased economic activity and employment opportunities at the local level as businesses expand to meet the requirements within nunavut
presently there are 383 approved firms listed in the registry for the nunavut area
this number is comprised of 50 firms in the kitikmeot 132 firms in the keewatin and 201 firms in the baffin
the complete list is located on the world wide web at
www kirk nt ca/nubip
mr speaker let me reassure all members that the nunavut business incentive policy is in effect for the period of april 1 1999 to march 31 2000
during this transition period a review will be undertaken in order to see how the policy can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of nunavut and article 24
mr speaker this review will involve nti and other interested stakeholders in order to ensure that we can obtain maximum input in developing a made in nunavut policy
mr speaker as the minister responsible for public works telecommunications & technical services i look forward to this review and encourage all interested parties to participate
this can only lead to greater benefits and economic opportunities in nunavut
thank you mr speaker

sustainable development s new inuktitut name
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker today i want to unveil our department s official new inuktitut name
we have searched long and hard for this name trying to capture in a single name the diverse functions of our department
and many different names for sustainable development were put forward
some names that circulated around included
pivalliajulirijikkut annaumaqatigiit pilirijingit and many others
today i am pleased to announce mr speaker the new official inuktitut name for our department
ikupigvilirijikkut
this term comes from old inuktitut and is well understood by our elders
this word ikupik means
to receive food or assistance to tide you over
we are a department where the nunavut residents can access funds technical information for community based planning and other programs for our communities
this name ikupigvilirijikkut fits us rather well
and the term is understood by the kitikmeot kivallirmiut and the qikiqtaalungmiut
mr speaker when sports hunting became possible one of the regulations was that all sports hunting of polar bears would be conducted using only a dogteam
as the inuit hunters started rebuilding dog teams one of the unexpected results was old inuktitut terms not in use for a long time had to be revived
this term ikupingniq has not been used in a while and the majority of the younger generation is not aware of its meaning
i am extremely pleased that we have also reclaimed this term for today s inuktitut
mr speaker i now unveil our department of sustainable development logo to my colleagues
ikupiktulirijikkut
these three circles represent our environment our economy and the people
our department continually strives to integrate and balance these three aspects of nunavut
i would like to express my gratitude to our elders and especially ollie ittinuar of rankin inlet for suggesting our inuktitut name and giving us the definition
thank you mr ittinuar
thank you mr speaker

hall beach school addition
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker i woke up in a very good way today
if my wife and children can see me i would like to tell them that i love them
today mr speaker i would like to say on behalf of my community of hall beach that our school was going to get an addition this year but it has been deferred until next year
this is an urgent matter because we are experiencing population growth
we don t even have grade 12
the school was built without a grade 12 classroom and the school is overcrowded
for this upcoming school season there will be 221 students going into our school and there are only ten classrooms and it is cause a concern because of safety reasons
in regards to safety and health codes the school will be overcrowded
mr speaker tomorrow i will be tabling a petition in regards to this issue

question 166 - 1 2
bussing in iqaluit
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is for the minister responsible for education
mr speaker on the 19th i made a members statement regarding bussing in iqaluit on the 25th i asked questions regarding bussing in iqaluit
mr speaker i would like to ask the minister if he is now aware of any issues relating to the need for bussing here in iqaluit
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister responsible for education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr speaker
yes i am aware of the additional bussing requirements for the coming school year
we are in discussion with the dea right now and this is a direct responsibility of the baffin education council
in those discussions they are to make the funding formula available when the school figures are finalized in this spring and summer
also there is a discussion on if the times can be staggered so that existing facilities can be used or utilized better
so there are discussions in three areas one is the staggering of the hours the other is a requirement for additional funding and the other one is for realigning or changing the routes in iqaluit for bussing
these are ongoing discussions i appreciate the members question and we will be working on that as hard as we can to resolve it before the next school year
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
however they do receive their funding through the department of education and i believe they have been trying to seek additional funds required for the bussing that is needed in iqaluit
mr speaker the minister also discussed the option of looking at staggered times that is already in place mr speaker all the schools start at different times
i have them here and i can tell you if you want but they are already doing that
even with the situation as it is right now mr speaker there are problems and concerns coming from parents because if they have students in more than one school that start at different times it creates problems at home
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr speaker
the member knows that in the budget session we cannot commit single handily for additional resources to purchase two more buses that have been identified by the member
however i will assure the member that my department i have told my department to work with the education authorities to find the most suitable way to resolve that problem
one way is to have a discussion with the baffin divisional education council to find if they have provision in there to be able to combat an unexpected increase or requirement for bussing service for iqaluit
all of these have been under discussion and i am waiting for my department to give me the most suitable way to resolve that
that is all i could tell the member right now because i don t want to undermine the authority of the divisional boards local education council who are having a discussion with my department
i don t want to undermine the best recommendations that they could give me in the meantime
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
all these other options have already been looked at they have been doing it for some time
mr speaker next fall we are going to have a problem
the new middle school up there are going to be taking students from all over iqaluit 163 of the students of the 177 that we know for sure will be attending that school next year will require bussing
the only way to accommodate that after thorough review by the dea by the education council is going to be the requirement to have additional buses

hopefully we can get this problem resolved so that we don t see kids walking in cold weather
also i would just like to ask the minister he had mentioned if they would qualify based on the funding formula

oral questions
mr irqittuq
question 167 - 1 2
use of government facilities by private business
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
regarding the reply i just received i have another question on the same subject
i would like a clear answer
perhaps i should be asking this to the minister of finance i don t want to embarrass ms thompson even though it is regarding the same subject that she just replied to
i am asking the government if i can just go to the garage staff and tell them that i can remove the snow for you if i can use your facility and your tools
so i can make an agreement of that kind for public works telecommunications & technical services facilities
speaker
mr ng minister of finance
hon kelvin ng
mr speaker the responsibility for gn capital assets rests with the department of public works so i will ask the appropriate minister to respond
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr ng
ms thompson minister for public works telecommunications & technical services
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
regarding the question being asked by the member for hall beach let me tell him first that i am not embarrassed by his remark contrary to his suggestion
i looked into this matter earlier and i looked into whether or not public works telecommunications & technical services made a mistake with the contractor in hall beach building the water reservoir
they are not using our facilities
by the way the arctic airports facility is not under my ministerial responsibility but it is up to these two organizations to make agreements for such a service
i can further respond by saying that i had a short discussion with the minister responsible for arctic airports mr anawak this morning regarding this
i don t know if he has had a chance to communicate what we talked about with his officials yet
i made my response earlier based on the information that i was able to obtain
there was an agreement between arctic airports and the contractor
this facility is not under my responsibility
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
oral questions mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i have another question along the same line
in the replies provided to me by the minister it says that there was an agreement between arctic airports and the contractor that they would provide gravel in return for repairing their heavy equipment in the airport garage
i don t know or i have not seen who requires gravel in hall beach although i am from that community
the road between the airport and the community belongs to arctic airports and it is in good order
i don t know mr speaker maybe i should ask this question who was requiring this gravel from arctic airports and where this gravel would be used
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have no details about how this gravel would be used
even though our department awarded this contract arctic airports operations are not under my department
i think that arctic airports can be asked where this gravel was going to be used
once the contract was awarded it is no longer under my ministerial responsibilities
perhaps this question should be asked to mr anawak
speaker
thank you ms thompson
the subject is changing here we were talking about whether the contractor could work in the warehouse the original question did not talk about moving of gravel to certain places
oral questions mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i just want clarification about that i am not talking about gravel but that is mentioned in the reply made by the minister
my question is whether or not they are going to be looking into the details sometime this week regarding this contract
speaker interpretation
are you directing this question to the same minister mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
mr speaker
yes i wanted to know if this minister will speak with the transportation minister about this
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister responsible for public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i understand exactly what the member is talking about and i will have further discussions with him as to what further details he may need
i can also find out what the gravel is to be used for
i will also be having a discussion with minister anawak and we will give a clear reply to the member and try to give that right away
we will try to give these answers before friday

question 168 - 1 2
ambulance services in nunavut
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
yesterday mr speaker in committee of the whole i was so infatuated with the honourable ministers story about the newfoundland tooth fairy that i forgot to ask a question
in regards to ambulance service in nunavut mr speaker my question to the minister is is he developing any kind of ambulance policy for the residents of nunavut
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the member is a little bit mistaken indeed there was no talk about tooth fairies indeed it was tooth charmers there is a considerable difference
on the ambulance policy mr speaker depending on operational requirements for example in a community like iqaluit there is an ambulance service provided through the town itself
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
rephrase your question mr mclean i will allow you the same question
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my community is sort of distressed that we don t have that type and level of service that they do have in the large regional centres
will the minister please answer me if nunavut government has a policy in regards to providing ambulance services to the rest of us
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
some other communities are a long distance away from the airport
for example in arctic bay the airport is 25 kilometres away from the community itself
so under the direction of the department do we have a specific policy for ambulances per community
no
thank you mr speaker
speaker

mr kattuk
question 169 - 1 2
local accommodation policy
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i was going to ask this question yesterday but we ran out of time
this question will be directed to the minister of public works telecommunications & technical services the honourable ms thompson
the gnwt had a policy requiring the use local hotels by contractors when they were available
they were required to use the local hotel facilities to accommodate their workers who came to work in our community
i wonder if that policy is still in place
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
the minister of public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation thank you mr speaker
they are prevented from building their own accommodation facility so the policy is still in place mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question to the same minister on the same subject
so when there is a contract in the same community the contractors who are based in the communities are we still going to see importation of private contractors
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the contractors i think all know the hiring policy for example
communities like sanikiluaq have the same opportunity to bid on contracts and we can further give a reminder of this issue to contractors
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
mr iqaqrialu
question 170 - 1 2 restoration of construction sites
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
perhaps this question is directed to the minister of transportation
the sites for building construction are drilled using piles and the access roads that are built near these sites are absolutely ruined
i wonder if those areas are going to be restored following the drilling of piles
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister of transportation mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the community governments such as hamlets are responsible for that area
i know that many communities are concerned about restoration of access roads and site restoration
i think that hamlets should be considering how they should do that
i think the municipal governments are in a better position to talk with the member about that rather than my department
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation

mr tootoo
question 171 - 1 2 members input to housing committee
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is directed to the minister responsible for community government housing & transportation
mr speaker i am sure that we were all pleased yesterday to hear his announcement of his corrections planning committee

oral questions mr alakannuark
question 172 - 1 2
changes to income support policy
mr alakannuark interpretation thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct my question to the minister of health and social services
are we going to be seeing any changes to the income support policy
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
minister responsible for income support mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation i apologize mr speaker i wasn t listening
i thought the question was directed to another minister
but in regards to the income support policy that is done through sustainable development
we are presently reviewing the policies and i would like to say that it is twofold there are monies that are run through the department of education and the regulations are done through sustainable development
we are presently doing a review of the whole policy issue
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the reason why i am asking is that the recipients receive a cheque and some of the money is used to pay for rent
women who are single parents have a hard time paying for everything with the amount of dollars that they get through the income support program and they cannot get another cheque until the following month
they have a hard time keeping up with their budget
speaker
thank you mr alakannuark mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in regards to your question we are presently doing a review in regards to the monthly payments
we are presently reviewing it and we have already identified some of the problems that we have with this program
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr kattuk
question 173 - 1 2
dog picked up by charter a mystery
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the minister of justice in my community well it s not really a major concern but a source of wonder
that s my question mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i guess i didn t make it clear the first time but i thought the letter of explanation was sent to the mayor of sanikiluaq
the rcmp were going down to sanikiluaq anyway when this happened
i could talk to you further personally afterwards about this
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr iqaqrialu
question 174 - 1 2
support for unilingual businesspersons
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct my question to sustainable development
regarding economic development
starting your own business is cumbersome especially to the inuktitut unilingual s who have to go through a lot of barriers set up when you try to apply through the business program
are you going to be making any changes
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister of sustainable development mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will be talking about this later when my department takes their turn at the witness table we are presently working on it
in regards to the applications for business loans or business grants most of the problems was that there were so many programs set under one department
we are presently reviewing the process on what we can put it in one part instead of having them all separated
people out there can apply through this one process and that would be set up at the community level will presently try to set up the system
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr nutarak
question 175 - 1 2
three ministers dealing with income support
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
when we were having a committee meeting dealing with income support one of the questions that was brought up was if they re going to be reviewing the guidelines for the regulations
i didn t know exactly who to direct my question in regards to income support program i think there s 3 ministers who are responsible maybe i should direct my question to the premier
it creates a problem when your trying to ask question regarding the income support program because so many ministers are responsible for it
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr okalik
hon paul okalik
interpretation
thank you mr speaker like the minister said it is presently under review and we re looking at the how it can be better set up for nunavut

mr o brien
question 176 - 1 2
artifact repatriation
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker my question is directed to minister of cley in relation to community such as mine
i m wondering if the minister can speak this as to how the communities can get some of these pieces of history back in their community
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for culture language and elders and youth mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am quite happy that you ask that question because we are trying to get everybody involved in what is happening
the only way we can work together is by sharing ideas and we will be doing this in all the communities of nunavut today
for an example if you are in arviat that you would be working directly with the people of arviat and we can start sharing ideas
since we are very new from what you are saying right now we will be able to come up with the solution on how we want to start getting our artifacts back to the community
as i stated before we have to share ideas in order to compete what we would like to do
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
by creating a large archive here in iqaluit i would assume that many of the artifacts would then be taken from the smaller communities and put in this large centre here
i d like the minister to speak to this how he would see this supporting the smaller that would like to see their artifacts stay in their community
there s many elders that will never have an opportunity to happen to come here to iqaluit to visit an archives here or to go to yellowknife where the archives located now
so how do you see this fitting in to the communities needs the smaller communities that is
thank you mr speaker
speaker
interpretation
thank you mr o brien minister of culture language elders and youth mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak
interpretation
thank you mr speaker i wonder if the member assumes that s it s going to be in iqaluit i have never suggested that there would be a museum or an archive centre here in iqaluit
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i believe in the capital plan it does indicate that the large sum of money for an archival centre and i believe it did indicate iqaluit but that s really not the issue
there having difficulties doing this and they d like to get them back before some of the elders pass away so they can review these tapes and so on
so i d like the minister look in to this to see if he can help us assist facilitate these artifacts coming back to the community in the very near future
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak
thank you mr speaker
yes we will be looking to those where we going to put those in which smaller community can have those things in your community as well but we are planning these at this time

oral question mr tootoo
question 177 - 1 2
increased power rate effects on communities
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is directed to the minister responsible for public utilities board
yesterday there was quite a discussion on hourly rates and how there going to be passed on to the consumer as a result of the infrastructure being put in to the community
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
mr okalik
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr okalik
oral question mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i don t know if i asked to the wrong person
maybe i should ask the minister of finance is there something in way that these decisions on infrastructure in communities say like the power corporation will go in and then build a new power plant in the community
that community is going to have to pay for it and if the results of that mean that the rates are going to increase in that community
the average person is going to fall on somebody and what i want to ensure is that decision will have impacts on the budgets that were talking about here today
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
just a reminder when you re asking a question you have to ask the same minister if you have different question you can direct it to different minister
mr tootoo would you rephrase your or which minister are you directing it to
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
i d like to direct it to which ever minister i don t know who can appropriately answer the question
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you
minister responsible for human resources & finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as my a honourable colleague mr picco would say indeed the member raises a good point
i think mr speaker if there is an application before the public utility board and the premier is correct it is an independent board that evaluates any rate adjustments that the power corporations would bring forward
if there s a major impact on the community and on government as a whole because obviously there are funding to municipalities and to the housing authorities
we have a significant investments and significant impact in respect of the cost
so that we would as a government put together position and intervene and put forward our concerns or our issues in respect to any propose rate increase that might be coming forward with the public utility board

thank you just before we begin to go into detail we need to clarify the rules in which to conduct our business during the committee of the whole
please confine your general comments to ten minutes and when you go into questions please try to make them concise because we don t have much time left to deal with the budget
members have agreed that they would like to conclude by thursday so try to keep track of the time that you are taking
we are now into general comments and questions
general comments
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the question i would like to ask as a general question for the department is that currently the schools are funded based on a student ratio and the student population per capita basis
i am wondering mr chairman is the department looking at other options such as program funding for any possible solutions to some of the problems that we currently face in the current education system
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
interpretation ends we are going to review all of the formula funding methods and practices etc for the next year and we will start proceeding with that
as i stated this morning everything is up for review and this is one of them
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman another question i have is in the minister s opening address he mentioned the highlights in this year s budget being 17 new teaching positions across nunavut
mr chairperson i would like to ask the minister if this is indeed 17 new teachers over this years current staffing levels
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i am really pleased to hear that and i am wondering if the department could let us know where those positions will be so that the boards in their respective regions can move on filling these positions
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
no we don t but next week we probably will be determining that better by communicating with other regions where the pressure points are where the greatest needs are with the divisional boards
right now we don t
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i am sorry if i am trying to jam these through but i am on a tight time frame here
as i discussed earlier this morning i don t know if the minister has had a chance to get updated on the bussing here in iqaluit
in his general comments in his opening statement he mentioned that the middle school there is an increase in capital spending in the middle school to have it ready sooner rather than later
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr chairman for that detail i would like to have my deputy minister answer that
chairperson
mr moody i hope that i said your name properly
mr moody
thank you
yes it is an additional amount to the original capital project
i believe the amount approximates 50 thousand dollars and that allows us to in co-operation with the dec to open that school i believe four and a half months earlier which will relieve significant crowding issues here in iqaluit
thank you
chairperson
mr tootoo any additional comments
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
the original idea was to eventually transfer them over to sustainable development for the delivery
we are now in discussions because i am told that some of the computers that are used in the communities are not y2k compatible
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
just a couple more questions regarding the ministers opening statement
he had also indicated in there that the department uses publicly funded day care centres
i am just wondering mr chairman are the day cares under this departments jurisdiction or would they fall under a different department
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
i am not completely up to date because it was a federal program before
for those details i would like to ask my adm to answer that
chairperson
go ahead assistant deputy minister levi
ms levi interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the child care program which we adopted from the gnwt we are administering that at the moment as part of the department of education
this is a year to year program and we are administering it up to date
some of the funding for start-up costs comes from the federal government and we are responsible for administering the licensing of these facilities
thank you
chairperson
thank you
if you have questions or general comments you should indicate now because i only have two names listed
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
there is one more question and then a brief comment and i will be done on the opening address
in there the minister indicated that arctic college will be moving to rankin inlet in the fall pending budget
i am just wondering if the minister could maybe clarify what he meant by that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
which one of you will be responding
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
we have not been able to find funding to do the transfer
we are still in the process i would like to have the deputy minister explain further
chairperson
mr moody
mr moody
thank you
there is an expense associated with the move to rankin inlet
the exact number of people that arctic college wish to move is being solidified i understand in the next few weeks from recent conversations with the president
then we will look within our budget to see if there are funds to assist the college with that
in the normal grant that we provide to the college there is no monies for that it is a special one-time item
we have to attempt to find that
the first step will be to solidify the numbers which we are advised will be in the next couple of weeks and then we will look for the dollar amount
so i think it is fair to say at this time that we can t say for sure when that move date might be
thank you
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
just a final comment before i pass the torch on to whoever else is next
mr chairman i learned that nunavut has the highest pupil teacher ratio in canada mr chairman
chairperson
that was just a comment
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the older students were able to go out on the land with funding from the department of education
these funds were for gasoline etc but that program was phased out
i wonder what the position of the government of nunavut is about reinstating these programs
i wonder what is happening with that program i saw it before and it was very beneficial mr chairman
the students were able to get hands on training through that program and i think it was valuable for the long term education of the young people
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we are always experiencing a shortage of funding in traditional programs we tried to divide up the funds for in school instruction and also for traditional land skills and traditional clothing education
we tried to divide funds which were already short and we have continued with these programs in spite of the cuts
we tried to consult with the inuit to see if that should be part of the program i think this is one of the areas that we will have to review and revisit as a new government
thank you for the ministers response i feel personally that these types of programs are very valuable to the well being of the young people
we also have these people at the local level who are able to instruct the younger people they are able to provide proper instruction in the community and for whoever is out on the land
being from the north sometimes we have 24 hour darkness and it is only when we have longer days that the young people are able to take advantage of these programs
we have a unique situation in the north where we experience 24 hour darkness and our children have to experience many hours in the class rooms
that erodes the ability of the young people to survive out on the land
this is just a general comment mr chairman i have another question that i would like to ask
chairperson interpretation
mr puqiqnak go ahead
mr puqiqnak interpretation
this seems to be the legislation and the department of education
once our child is sixteen there is much more flexibility before they are sixteen but after that they are treated differently
there is a requirement that they go to school until they are sixteen and then after they turn sixteen they don t care any more and they are no longer required to be in school
it is no longer mandatory
i wonder if your department can look into this some time in the near future in the new government
thank you
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in inuit society even when they are older we treat them as children and that is why our department is trying to prepare to work with parents on what their requirements are
we want to work with the parents
the department of education is not a parent on its own and should not be working on its own
as parents we have a responsibility towards our children to provide for them not just in education
as i said i want to work with my fellow mla s community s local education councils so that we can address those concerns about stay in school programs and how important education is
chairperson interpretation
go ahead mr puqiqnak any further questions
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman one of the concerns that i have and i am sure most of the people around the table also share is the fact that we have such limited capital dollars to deal with
i believe that the numbers for this year are 6 4 million dollars in the capital budget
most cases that would just barely build a new school
chairperson
which one of you will be responding to that
which of the witnesses
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
interpretation ends yes that recognition is a very very difficult one to come to right now but the department in my opening address also has stated that there will be a requirement for capital plans beyond five years
we will have to make capital plans that reflect the growing population of nunavummiut for example arviat
i think after this year after the initial decentralization program that we will have a better handle on exactly what the population growth of the children will be
i think that will stabilize and it will be better for predicting or forecasting capital requirements for different communities
how do we reduce dependency on the government in the long run
these will have to be looked at
i don t think this government can afford to do a long term band aid of the problems i don t think we can afford that
we tried that with the gnwt and it didn t work very well
we will have to have a better handle on forecasting what the population growth especially of the children are
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson does the minister have any idea at this point time as to roughly what they d be looking at in capital dollars even next year one year away from now
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr chairman looking at the history of the requested or required capital dollars for education in the past it has been approximately fifteen million dollars
but that does not mean that this is a total requirement
because since the high school introduction in the communities the requirement also have increased and there may be other requirements in the education field for example
if that is adapted by this legislative assembly then the requirement will jump significantly
so it s not until such time legislative assembly directs the government and ultimately the department of education then we will have to use the status quo for next year
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
just a brief question
i would like the minister or one of the staff to tell me of the 27 jobs that are i guess they re going to be in place for my community
when can we expect those jobs to be in place fully filled in my community
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
we re still filling them now and although some are still working at home because there is no office space but for the completion we d like to fill them all during this fiscal year
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman is it fair to say that the tie-up with these jobs been filled is the fact that the office building is not available at this point and time
if that the major factor for the delay
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr chairman that s a little bit of detail but i d like to have my deputy minister to answer that
chairperson interpretation
mr moody
mr moody
mr chairman we have been progressing to fill those position regardless of the fact that the office building has not been finished
the initial hold-up was the fact that there was limited funds to hire new staff in the fiscal year that we just ended
but we have now hired and we have four people in the arviat operation here place today and in fact three of the individuals are here on in-service in iqaluit this week
they are currently either working from home or have just acquired with the co-operation of our department department of public works a housing unit which was vacant for temporarily using that as office space
we are currently recruiting for additional positions for arviat
so regardless of when the building will open we will actually continue to recruit
it is unfortunate that it is not open today but we re not letting that hold us up
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
can the minister tell me i ve been through the building a few weeks ago when i was home and it looked fairly complete to me
what is the tie-up and when can we expect to move people into that building
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
it looks complete even by telephone but can t telephone there
telephone fax those kind of equipment essentials are not complete but i m told that they would be completed by after 1st of july
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
just second part of my question is it fair to assume that after the phone systems are installed that at that point we can then more people this new building
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
yes we hope that by after 1st of july then we will start recruiting as much as we can get in those competitions and transfers etc
etc
that we would like to have that done around that time thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
this is my last question comment
the 27 positions that are earmarked for my community at this point and time can you confirm that there are no changes to those numbers that these positions will be located in the community
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
that s right that s true that s the number we have been told any other directive from the government to do likewise
that s the number we have
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman my question is about the students who have graduated in grade 12 who would like to attend university but usually there is no funding for students to attend universities
what is the status of assistance for students who liked to go down to universities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
there are different ways of sponsoring students according to the university they re attending
i would like ian rose to elaborate
ian rose
chairperson interpretation
ian rose
mr rose
there are a number of programs that can we use
for most students attending southern university receiving a funding through the student financial assistance program
students would apply to the department for their funding depending upon whether they are a single student or a student with dependants their level of funding would be based on that scale
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i have another question
i don t know if it s directly involved if the department is involved usually they use training programs or carpentry or plumbing and they usually go to the west to get that kind of training
to have that kind of training in the communities would be very valuable
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr mclean you re up
mr mclean
thank you mr chairman
i going to go back i try to keep to 10 minutes but i might get carried away here
it nice to see everybody here armed and dangerous with paper
the capital planning process has been involved in deas and regional education authorities for the last decade
i m going to do a bit of history here because we all have a tendency to say in kabluna talk that history repeats itself
and i m hoping now that its nunavut that history won t repeat itself
the past finance minister negotiated our formula finance agreement with the thought of decentralization in mind
unfortunately when he was negotiating with the federal government on decentralization in foreman financing agreement he must have been asleep in regards to capital projects
i go through the wish list from the department from bob moody and there is something like 16 17 school extensions or renovations planned in the next 3 to 4 years
i m just throwing a ball park figure out there because all renovations in new buildings are different
conservative estimate is that we re going to need close to one hundred fifty million dollars
that s just my estimate
and like i say they re conservative
to get nunavut up to where it should be for our booming population that we hear so much about
so you have momentous task on your hands to find one hundred fifty million dollars for school facilities alone and that doesn t really take in the adult education facilities
our capital plan this year is fifty five million dollars total and i think there is ten million dollars for schools
so the plan ahead of us and with our finance minister at the helm we ve got a monumental task ahead of us in regards to putting in schools at communities that deserve them
now in the past it wasn t necessarily the case in the region that i live in that schools were given to communities in need in dire need
it was done on political will just before election time
a member
name one
mr mclean
exactly and i don t want to pick on another community or anything like that but rankin inlet has a school that was built as a regional high school
the mani uluyuk school with the capacity of 451 students and it has 185 in there
the leo ussak elementary school was built for the capacity of 374 and they have 255
and being on the regional education board i fought tooth and nail to have a capital plan equitably and fairly in the region and they turned around and built a middle school in rankin inlet
so i think their capacity in rankin inlet is 30 to 40%
where as i know if we went around to the other schools in the region the capacity is anywhere from 85 to 120%
so i m getting back to standards and criteria in need
and in the government in yellowknife always didn t have the true figures of what populations were in the school because i watched it and studied it
so i m hoping when this department was closer to the government or closer to the people its going to be a little bit more flexible and really put schools in renovations in places they need them
and being member of this government and seen what happened in the past i m going to keep this government to it
i really am
if a school needs to be built in a certain community it should be built there
if a renovation has to be built in a certain community it should be built there
they shouldn t be built at politicians whims as they were in the past
i m not blaming you guys this is new
we re all in this together and i m going to see to it so when i do my 10 minutes let me go but i want to go into other things
the school populations right now in the keewatin there was a 15% influx of students into the keewatin schools this year and the funding was status quo
so 15% of 2 200 students is roughly 300 so the important of the finance i should have been at least 15 new teachers hired this year
i know you guys are dealing with the budget and i know we re all concerned about education
not in all cases
and i know we re looking at the poor minister of finance there and we re saying we need for money for education
we all have to live within the realms the realms of we all have to live within the means and what i m saying i m hoping this is going to change over the next year
you said you re hiring 17 new teachers i m hoping you re going to put them in communities that the student teacher ratio need them the most because i can agree on that
bussing we inherit this bussing policy from the west
this bussing policy was formulated in the west based on whatever
it was based on their climate
they would give us a certain amount of money to the divisional board in the keewatin for 4 months of the year the 4 coldest months
well the 4 coldest months in yellowknife or hay river are not necessarily the 4 coldest months in arctic bay iqaluit or baker lake
we went to the point where we hosted bingo s and did fund-raising to make the bussing schedule fit the needs of the community
and we fortunately were successful in paying enough money through fund-raising binges and through our contribution for regional education council to provide bussing year round
you know it could be a threat and we heard in arviat there wolves in bake lake foxes and stuff like that so i think there should be a bussing policy formulated to reflect the needs of nunavummiut
inuit educators i ve been they ve been sadly neglected in the last 7 or 8 years
saying that they had 40 million dollars to train people to work in the nunavut government at various levels of management or what ever what ever what ever
and he had the nerve to come to a regional education meeting and say well its not their to help the inuit educators and i m going what are you doing at this meeting
well its just to advice you so you can advise your high school students and other people in the community
and i says well what about a classroom assistant that s worked in a classroom for 10 or 15 years taken a tep course got here b
ed and you know they re committed they re committed 15 25 years in education system and then money comes out for training people in nunavut and they re not eligible for it
like to me that was injustice terrible injustice to probably the most committed group of individuals in our education system and like i say again there are certain number of dollars going around
the more help they have the better our education system will be
and i m sure you ll look at that mr minister because i know you re involved in education and is concerned about it as i am
your staff
i ve known mr rose for 30 years i remember murray horn when i was a young lad and i ve know you james and i really don t know carmen levi that much
chairperson interpretation
mr mclean your time is up you may ask another question
or you can ask another question to you and ask if you can have general consensus in order to go over your time
proceed
mr mclean
thank you mr chairman and my fellow colleagues
i ll end it right now
i just want to see more people out in the field
we re supposed to be closer to the government
i d like to get mr rose out in the keewatin
murray used to live there
it helps being in a region in the keewatin where the board office is in the community
but the biggest complaint from the staff was they never saw the staff of the board office in their school
they were always out travelling around
that s it
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
did you want to make a response
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
i know exactly where you re coming from
i would also like to thank him
i m sure that we will not want to repeat his traces because of the inconsistencies and so on
so right now i would like to be very open
we d like to look as how we can improve the education system openly amongst ourselves and we will also have to realize that there is a limit to the money
so we have to use look at how we can best use our money effectively for the people of nunavut
thank you
chairperson interpretation
do you have another question mr mclean
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
his opening remarks yesterday he said that he would like to see education closer to the people of to the communities of nunavut
can you clarify that point
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
the arctic college
i think some people think that arctic college is here in iqaluit ft smith far away and it s something that s foreign to the people of nunavut
i can use an example of arctic college etep students
they re taking their training at arctic college but the arctic college is community based
that s the perception that the people have out there
so i would like to get arctic college a little bit closer to the communities so that there can be dialogue between the people and arctic college and the board of governors for example
those are the ideas that we have
chairperson interpretation
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
there are some students who take heavy equipment operator courses in ft smith and heavy equipment mechanic apprenticeship programs do you have any plans on setting up trade school over here in the nunavut area
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
yes that s a part of it s a part of what we re doing now
a lot of people go to ft smith to take the heavy equipment operator courses and trades and also there is also a mine in nanisivik and i believe there is one opening in the keewatin area
so we have to get planned ahead so that we can put people into those into the provision of these services
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
it s not a question but it s regarding the arctic college that s in my home community
it s very very small and it seems like nobody s given it a second thought so the adult education for the arctic college in pond inlet has to be renovated
chairperson interpretation mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
okay we ll look into it chairperson
mr nutarak mr nutarak interpretation
okay my last comment yesterday in your opening remarks there was twenty-six point one million dollars i believe
i m sure were going to talk about it when we get into the main estimates
do you give out those monies on a per capita basis or how do you what s the formula
chairperson interpretation
any one of you mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
i have exactly no idea how its set
it s on a per capita basis
i ll get our assistant deputy minister to elaborate on this
chairperson interpretation
ms levi
ms levi interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in regards to the income support the regulations are and policies are dealt with by the sustainable development and we handle the operations portion
some of our employees work through the hamlet councils and some through our departments
the community s are given a pys
there has been no change in the salaries and benefits
even if they are working under the hamlet councils the same rules or policies apply
also when money is given to the communities they are given the same amount as they use the previous year so that is how the money is given out to the communities chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
if they do more than service clients we are also looking at whether they could also be there to provide employment services
mr kilabuk and i are discussing this right now i am not saying that this is going to be the case but we are exchanging ideas on how we can improve the system for nunavut
chairperson
thank you mr arvaluk
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
first of all i would like to make a comment about the provision of buses in the communities
i believe that is a concern all over nunavut
we do have a bus in sanikiluaq but it cannot be used for all the students
some of the people bring in students with skidoos and other modes of transportation and i believe that it is like that all over the communities
a man will bring his kids to school first instead of going out hunting or delaying their hunting trip so that they can bring their children to school
it is more of a comment but my question is in regards to the dea s
it has been quite a while now since they had to use the money for specific purposes
i would like to know if there is going to be money given to the dea s that they can use at their discretion
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we do have a policy maybe ian can elaborate on it further
chairperson
mr rose
mr rose
from there the money can be reallocated or re-profiled within the dec s or reallocated to other schools so if they are high in one area they can move money from there to another area where they are low
so monies can be moved around and re-profiled within the areas chairperson
thank you mr chairman
chairperson mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
this issue you brought up is being negotiated and we are still in the process of reviewing all of those whether they can be given the authority to do all those things thank you
chairperson i have two names here on the list and one member is allowed ten minutes would you like to take a break right now or would you like to go on
okay let s take a five minute break >>committee recessed at 2 38 and resumed at 2 54 pm
chairperson interpretation
thank you for returning to the table
right now mr iqaqrialu has a question
mr arvaluk you raised your hand first you may speak
hon james arvaluk interpretation
ms levi has to go to gjoa haven tonight so i had to get a replacement
this is murray horn who deals with capital and especially finances and phoebe hainak is also here
i would like to welcome them
as we mentioned earlier we have an employee from arviat ms joy suluk she is the nunavut education development officer
david freeman information officer for adult education programs and nancy highland is also a manager
thank you
chairperson interpretation
welcome to the meeting
we can start mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i am glad you have your staff with you
first of all i would like to make a comment in relation to my community
at present we are above average in looking at the population of nunavut clyde river is the highest rate of students on a yearly basis
because of this i would like to request more funding for bussing services for my community
i know that there are a number of people from my community who would like to attend university or secondary education
i would like to request that clyde river be a community base for arctic college or for a university for the future
the funding that is designated for secondary education programs are usually managed in iqaluit so it becomes cumbersome for the small communities
i was wondering whether that will still be the case
i will raise another question after you respond
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
i noticed two questions but i will answer the first question first
i would like every member to know that we will not be dealing with these kinds of issues alone as a department
we will be consulting the appropriate agencies and the regular members as well as the whole education system
at this moment we are assessing all of those programs and policies
after the divisional boards are dissolved then we will be able to give more authority to the community education committees so they would be able to make decisions that effect them directly
so in that manner we will be hiring appropriate people for the positions in the communities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i believe that we will be consulted appropriately and you will not be making decisions alone as a department
perhaps the elders that are being consulted as experts perhaps they should be hired as expert consultants by arctic college in nunavut
i know that we can make the system better for the people in that manner
thank you
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
so during our review we will be developing a streamline a baseline to pay through contract perhaps we can hire the inuit consultants
we still have to review those areas and we will be doing them more in the future
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
i understand what you are saying but the teachers have to have certification or a diploma in order to teach elementary or secondary levels
i know that in the future inuit teachers will have to get more education
when the teachers don t have diplomas even though they have more experience they don t fix their income appropriately and it has effected the staff in the education system
the morale of the staff have been impacted by that
when you hire an inuk for example who has completed university or college down south because they have been away from their home and their culture for too many years while attending schooling they have to be taught again
it seems that this issue will have to be dealt with while you are doing your overview since up north everything is very expensive and staff have to be paid according to their experience and according to their education
even though they are paid appropriately the higher costs of living makes everything too expensive
i will ask this question again
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
this will have to be clearer to the people
individuals who have completed their schooling when they have ba s or diplomas they are formally recognized as being educated
for instance the same thing as trade school we know that even though they have completed their schooling they don t know how to read inuktitut
they cannot teach in inuktitut so because they are being taught in a very specific area
i know that inuit elders experts from arviat have been recognized for being consultants and from their experience they are now being recognized more and more and we would like to see more of this happening in the communities
even though they have teachers certificates or diplomas it doesn t mean that they are qualified on every aspect
they are taught how to teach and for instance it depends on which programs they are taking
it can be extended into whatever areas they are taking
thank you
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i was more concerned about the wages that are being paid to classroom assistants and others who are not certified
are you going to be looking into that as well
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
mr chairman i don t think that i said a certificate or a diploma has nothing to do with the wages that are being paid
people are paid according to their qualifications and in their specialized areas
we will be looking at that and would like to finish that in the not too distant future
that is one of our targets to review all of these areas and we ll be consulting with the mla s and members of the public when we are doing the review
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i am glad to hear that
those of us who have not completed grade 12
i think that we need to communicate to the people how important it is to go beyond grade 12 because they are not trained to take on jobs
i think that people are finding it a disappointment that after spending all of these years getting your grade 12 they are still not able to get employment
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes grade 12 is often the minimum education for getting employment
for example this is a basic curricula that teaches you how to do basic math basic reading and writing and it is only in preparation for getting a higher education which will enable you to take other training
also those people in the smaller communities particularly are not prepared to go to higher education such as universities even though they are in high school they are not prepared for post secondary education
if they re going to go to a university there needs to be a program to bring them up to par to prepare them for entry into arctic college or a university in a southern institution
they have to have a certain level of math a certain level of english programs
let us remember that what we have learned from our parents was hard
that was an education in their own way and we were taught to survive in that environment
what we are seeing right now is students even though they have grade 12 their basic knowledge is only what they have learned in the classroom
because we are working people we are not teaching our children as our fathers and mothers did when we were children
so we have to say that and telling our children to get their grade 12 so that further education will be available to them either through the college or through the university
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
these are essential to survival in the north and by incorporating the present curriculum along with traditional type programs they would complement each other
i will stop at this point but i may have another question again later on before we are finished
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
that s why we have to review what should included in there and what kind of specialized people we need to teach that probably in our department
i think nowdlak and other people working in that area we ll have to careful look at that and stop calling these cultural inclusion programs
rather this will be more like a inuit qaujimajatuqangit iq programs like on the land skills and knowing how the weather is ice conditions how to process wildlife and maybe college program traditional knowledge education
to look at other ways that why we have such a high rate of suicide and why people have change their life styles i think these can be a part of the social studies program
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you chairperson
i don t have too much left to say but i m very happy that we ll be working together to get the university in my community
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you chairperson
my question is specifically about students who started as young children when they were 5 years old they are require to start school and they go up to grade 9 that s our level in my community
then they have to go away to go to school to take advantage of higher education and they can no longer use the educational facilities in the community even there still going to school
they have to relocate to another community and because they don t want to leave their parents and even though there no longer young children but they still haven t obtain their grade 12 there unwilling to leave their parents
i think we all know i know how hard it is when you have child is going who has to be outside a community to get higher education
i know that it s very difficult to keep that student in school and i have experience it myself
it s difficult because that child is mine and that child is home sick it s hard to see
some communities still don t have a grade 12 my question is what are you doing or what can be done to have all the communities grade 12 available in their schools
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i ve been hearing that for a long time the teacher s who educate our children and if the children are unable to attend school it was responsibility of the parents to make sure that their children go to school
the parents can be charged if they don t send their child to the school i didn t know about that before so i got very scared when i found out
if your child under the age of 16 doesn t go to school the parent can be charged
i ve been hearing this for sometime and i think that was in the legislation
now are you going to be reviewing that i don t think it s fair when you have to be you know it s not an incentive to charge the parents to make their children to go to school
now are you going to be reviewing that legislation
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
this is going to be up to the legislature when were working on reviewing our legislation to make it more for the people and how we can incorporate initiative for the parents to keep their children in school
i think that once that is decided by the legislation will have to obey it
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
those are the only questions i have
thank you very much for answering my questions
chairperson
thank you mr alakannuark
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson let s begin with a bunch of general questions in reply to the ministers opening address
i honestly and truly believe over the last number of years the entire education system in north has been a victim of cutbacks
if you were to take a snap shot or the strictly the high school i would imagine that there s a drastic cut in the number of students that flow from in to the primary into the high school
once they hit the high school levels you have to meet basic requirements and a lot of those cases were seeing the drastic drop outs as a results of students who are not prepared and do have those qualifications
a really question the fact the system that we have right now i think there needs to be a fundamental change in the way we deal with it
i understand that i know from when i was in school there was program funded so students had an opportunity not only to participate in the academic not all people are academics
the teachers out there are doing very best with what they ve been given to work with what they haven t given the resources they need to do the job properly
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairperson
there are some very good comments i will be demanding true reflection of the past experiences with the educational system
the previous cut backs that resulted over crowding in the schools as a result that the students can t do as will as they should have
but keeping in mind that the total budget of the government is not very much i mean it has to be spread out with different programs and services of the nunavummiut i believe some of them will not require
big increases in dollars to improve them rather try to find most efficient way of making those programs and projects and services work better
that part too will be looked at the same time so i will need available mla to work with me
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson i think i ll leave those as general when we get into the specific of the budget ask some more question at that time
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
iqaqrialu did you wanted make another comments no
thank you any other comments mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq
interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
at least i m very pleased today that i m able to sit here with you
my parents or my grandparents had made a mistake it hurts me in my heart because of the fact that i wanted to get formal education
i just wanted to talk a bit about the back ground but the during the time when we were just before the election during the campaign days i think we all use education as our platform
listening to the campaign through the media all the members now during their campaign used education as their platform and education has always been a priority
i m very glad that james wants us to work with him one thing i have worked very hard which i will be bring forth now i know that i will be bringing this up again in the future meetings
in the smaller communities although we are very pleased that we are utilizing our mother tongue in the smaller communities
i realize that i did not train my children on that aspect
many people in that age our age we have been taught by our parents how to sew and how to hunt
the students who are of age to learn the traditional skills still don t know how to survive
we are losing that knowledge in our communities so before we lose all of our culture mr chairman i would like to see them revived and being instructed
i know that your department will work hard towards that goal
those are the issues that i would like to raise and those are the issues that i have used as a platform during my campaign
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we cannot really respond but i just want him to be aware that i believe that having two languages if you know two languages it does not hinder you from using another language
as the member stated my son is in grade 11 my child since he was going to school he doesn t seem to be using the inuktitut language in the community
it might be true but they don t take language arts in the classrooms but usually the language arts are taught by the parents
the only time they are taught english is how to read and write
if a student doesn t utilize his language at home the level of learning is not going to be as good
all of us have learned how to speak english when we went to school
once we started reading government documents or books in the library
once this is taught in school the first language must be taught by the parents and once you are taught you can get good at speaking in that language
also it is a fact that some students will have to get further entry levels such as learning basic math and english because the community high school learning program was vocational training
the local education authorities don t usually prepare the students to go to university and if the local education authority tries to they can prepare their students at an entry level
one issue that he raised that i should have taught my child more on life skills and survival skills i think that sometimes we tend to think that all of the requirements of learning should be taught in schools
i think some of them should be taught at home
i think we have to say to all nunavut residents that we have to take on that responsibility if we want to train our children
i suggest the way to do this is to go out hunting build a kamotik and build an igloo
i have that responsibility to teach my child
for that reason i could buy my son hockey equipment for 500 dollars because he wants to go out hunting or if a student wants to go swimming you buy them bathing suits
so there are many issues that the school doesn t teach
social skills
as a father i should hold that responsibility to teach my child
i think we have to publicize the fact that the parents have to take on that responsibility too because the students are in school from 9 - 5 with different subjects
we have to take on this responsibility as parent to teach our children social skills
it is not segregated the children tend to follow their parents life style
so we have to take that and we have to keep on elaborating that to our children
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr irqittuq do you want to make any other comments
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i agree with you and in some ways i don t
i believe what he is saying that we get to learn about life after the schools
chairperson interpretation
mr irqittuq your time is up
you need unanimous consent to continue
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to get unanimous consent to continue my comments
chairperson interpretation
mr irqittuq is looking for unanimous consent to continue his comments
some members
agreed
chairperson interpretation
ok
you may go ahead mr iqaqrialu
i can t speak any english but at least i can say ok
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you
what i was trying to say is that his response is a fact and it is entirely true
even after being in school we learn new things daily
the reason i wanted to see that is because the students stay in school for a long period during the day
for example i have a grandchild and her mom the mother of my grade 12 is still in school
if she has to write in english she can t write properly and she still can t speak proper english
usually we send our students to school at the age of 5 for fifteen years they go to school and they are still in school
i feel that this has to be improved because i know that they are very articulate i am talking about my home community
there is a problem somewhere in the education system
i am not saying that all the communities in nunavut should have a good education system but i want to have a good education system in my home community
i am glad that you stated the local education authorities will have more authority
i have seen all of these things and think that we have to rectify them
that s why i have mentioned what i stated to the minister
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr minister would you like to respond
hon james arvaluk interpretation
no
but i just want to say that we have given the local education authority the authority to deal with what you have stated
we usually have various reasons why the students don t go to school like mr anawak had stated for housing
housing also has an impact on a student s education due to overcrowding it has an impact on the students
if the student can t do his or her homework if there are too many people in the house they don t have time to do their homework because of other people in the house
we have to deal with this as a whole we have to deal with this as a whole because one little reason is not enough
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr irqittuq do you want to comment further
mr irqittuq interpretation
possibly after the other members make comments
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
just a few brief questions for the minister and some comments
we have heard a number of the member speak about their concern about the level of education an example would be a student that is in grade 9 reading at a grade 3 level
i know that may seem harsh and i am not saying that it is the norm but i know for a fact that it does exist
my question to the minister before we can deal with the problem we have to identify it and see what level it is at or how severe it is
is there any testing that takes place now that students in grade 3 to 9 that tests them for their reading level to see what level they are at
it may say that they are in grade 8 but are they only reading at grade 4 or 3
is there such testing being done now across the board
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
i would like to have ian rose answer that
chairperson
mr rose
mr rose
thank you
if i understand the question correctly the standardized testing across so that all students in all grades in all communities receive the same test
that is occurring only at the ages of 13 and 16 in some subject areas at this point
thank you
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
in the example i gave it was a student in grade 9 that was only reading at grade 4 or 3
are you testing now any of these students to see what actual level they are at
not their grade level but their actual reading level
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
there is no departmental program in testing on across the board however there is a provision that is being practised that the students are tested in their own classrooms by their own teacher to determine their level
but mr chairman actually i think with that question then we probably could get more information from the field then give a more detailed response to the member if he wants
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
that would be helpful mr chairman
but i would ask the minister if he would commit to survey the severity of the problem
it is difficult to deal with unless you know how big it is
what grades what levels and what ages and so on you are dealing with
so i would think that would be the first step in dealing with the overall problem here
the second point i want to talk about is social passing
basically just moving students on because maybe you are just tired of them being in the classroom or whatever
would you speak briefly to that and what your thoughts are and whether you think it should be changed and how you would address it
thank you
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
these are good questions
i am going to answer the second one first
i don t believe in social passing i am dead against that
because what is the point of going to school if you are not going to be preparing yourself for the academic world or the working world when you grow up social passing will not do
i would like to honour the request by the member on the survey
chairperson
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i can certainly wait for that information i just think that it is something that the minister and his staff should be looking at
it certainly doesn t do anybody any good to leave school and say that i have grade 10 or 11 and only have a grade 2 or 3 reading level
so i would think that is something that the minister and his staff may want to take as a priority and speak with the various principals and teachers around nunavut and see exactly what they feel
i guess the other part of the problem is how do you correct it
i guess that is why you are the minister so we will leave that up to you
thank you
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
yes we have a literacy consultant now alexis utatnaq and some other staff who can take specific assignments in specific communities and for specific persons
in other areas for example fas situations that exist in our schools that we have to work with health & social services in that area and co-ordinate with other departments depending on the program
so the problem we have here is we have a population of students in our schools but they also have different problems of their own that touch on other departments responsibilities
so it is fairly complicated
chairperson
thank you mr arvaluk
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
mr arvaluk has stated quite a number of times that he would like support from the members of the legislative assembly
when are you going to be asking for this support from the members
that is my question mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
i am sure the government will have a plan of what kind of legislation they would like to see and the preliminary plans will probably be given to the standing committees for consideration
the department of education will probably give them their goals to the committees for review
as i stated earlier we are still short on staff and we are not going to have thinks all set out and given to you
we would like to work together with you on the educational issues and we will start our plans prior to the october sitting

i was actually relieved to hear the ministers statement on social passing
are you aware of how much social passing is going on in the nunavut schools or is it just in certain regions
is it nunavut wide
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr chairman i don t have a clue
i think that is the only time we will be able to say what competence level our students have and what level they are at what grade level they are at
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk please recognize the chairperson
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairman
i am not aware of how much it is in nunavut but i am aware of it in my own individual community
it distresses me to follow statistics in the keewatin where we have an 85% dropout rate
so our kids have an 85% chance of not finishing school
i am aware of the departmentals that are being written in baker lake that are the alberta departmentals
if they don t have solid skills and problem solving abilities when the get into grade 9 10 11 that s where our dropout rates start
to me if you don t develop skills for getting out of bed every morning going to a school and studying hard then i think that is going to contribute to the dropout rate
thank you
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
i am sorry that i got a little bit excited
we have to work with the parents
somehow we have to find a way to have the parents involved have them take charge of their own children
i think we also have to consider the practice of educating the parents if i may use that word that the children don t get a second chance in education
you cannot stop their age
they are growing they ve got a birthday every year if they miss that out then by the time they are adults they don t want to start from grade 1 again
so i think that we have to recognize using a method that the parent knows for example how to bring up a baby from infancy to a toddler to a five year old
how do you guide them through that the children are the same way they have to be guided in a way that they will be comfortable
it doesn t really matter to them so the students feel not cared for by the parents in their daily struggle in school the don t get a pat on the back when they are doing well
they are not awakened and fed in the morning is that showing that they don t care
no not necessarily it is just that they are sleepy
i think that we are going to have to work with the parents as to what the end result is going to be if we don t work together

so there will be six
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman there are some areas here that i see in these studies when you look at the labour force review and the nunavut arctic college funding
are those the kinds of things that go hand in hand
i am just wondering if they are going to incorporate those types of things into their labour force review
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes mr chairman we have to look at what in the labour force market for work in nunavut not just in the mining industry but also the shrimp fisheries by
qikiqtaaluk corporation and there are potential jobs for people in nunavut not necessarily tied to the government of nunavut
so we will include all of that
chairperson
mr tootoo mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i would like to ask the minister in here it says language of instruction and curriculum planning
just to point out a fact that over the past two years here at the high school they ve posted an inuktitut position and have got absolutely no response to those positions
i am wondering if in light of this if the minister could maybe provide a brief outline of the types of things that will be looked at in the language of instruction and curriculum
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
we appreciate that and that is why we need more training in the area of language specialists because there is a demand for those things and there will be more demands in those areas especially in high school
we are making plans now as to how we can get more training programs for language specialists
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman maybe just to help speed up the process a little bit
so that if we are members of the legislative assembly would like to have any input or suggestions to assist the department we would then be given the opportunity to do so
could i just look for a commitment for that in the future
and that would clear up any questions in this area
thank you mr chairman

mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman historically corporate services has been the department that looks after the other services within other divisions within the department
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes mr chairman inevitably this will be the job of the implementation co-ordinator to identify with the divisional boards what areas would be effected by that
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i would like to just ask the minister and his staff
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
the regional office personnel will still be there to help the dea s in whatever areas they need help
what we are saying is that some of these positions in corporate services may not be required in the regional office
we will have to identify first which positions will be moved to other departments of the government
but for services that are required by the dea s there will still be i am pretty sure that the implementation co-ordinator will recognize those as essential services to those dea s
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the point i was trying to make was that there is going to be a mechanism to support the local dea s to administer and function with the additional responsibilities that they will be faced with
also mr chairman i would like to ask the minister if we ll use iqaluit as an example there are four schools here in iqaluit now
the dea has or will have a huge responsibility to look after all four schools
will there be provisions for them to be able to if they need to hire staff to assist them in their day to day operations
the minister can correct me if i am wrong but i understand that all of these boards right now are on an volunteer basis
as more responsibility is going to be dumped on to them i don t know if it is fair to force a group of volunteers to look after all of the additional responsibilities that they will be faced with
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr chairman we will have these options put forward because i for one don t want to pre-judge the implementation co-ordinators recommendations

chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman this is where the college is given all of its funding
as most of us are aware this funds all of their core programs i am wondering mr chairman if the minister is looking at the need in the communities in nunavut
is that something that the department is looking at ensuring that we have core funding for programs other than the existing programs over there
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
if he had indicated that he was looking at it is there something that we can expect to see that there will be core funding for the programs here in iqaluit through the college here in the next year
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes we are now working with the government and we hope that we will be able to get funding from somewhere internally and proceed with that because there is nothing here right now in this budget
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i know that a number of students not only from iqaluit but from all over nunavut were here taking the pre-nursing course
as i went around during the campaign and talked to people at the college they were anticipating and hoping that this program would start up again in the fall
mr chairman i would like to clarify that the minister is stating that there will not be funding for the nursing program here at arctic college this fall
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
not in this main estimates but i haven t given up yet
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman has the department taken a look at the existing programs that are offered through the college
as in anything when you train people for a length of time then the need out there changes
i am wondering if they are looking at doing any changing with what they are supplying their core funding for to maybe something that is more needed and required outside of the programs that are there right now
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes in fact as we speak we are reviewing those possibilities with the nunavut arctic college
hopefully within the month we would be able to answer the member
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i also would like to get clarification in regards to the nursing program
perhaps with the minister for health and social services i forgot what we were dealing with on the main estimates
i don t remember if the main estimates for health and social services budget included the nursing training course
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation

just a quick comment here or question
i know that in the previous capital plan there were some dollars allocated for additional student residences here in iqaluit
mr chairman i would like to ask the minister i see that they are not on this capital plan i wonder if they are on the b list
are they still on the plans for additional student residences here in iqaluit

some members
agreed
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman this is the area that determines all of the staffing in the school systems if i am correct in assuming that
so if they had four students that required someone with them all day they would only get two people to help deal with them
now if they are all in different classes or something like that i can see that it creates problems within the school
so i would like to know if this is something that the department is taking a look at and if not now when would they be looking at addressing it
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
we are using the status quo this year because we came in as a government on april 1 and the budget allocations were already there basically
but for next year we will be reviewing all of the formulas that are used in this and pertaining to the question of mr tootoo
so yes we will be looking at those as part of the review
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo i am sorry mr tootoo i was on the wrong channel if you could summarize your questions because the clock is ticking
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
mr chairman as was indicated earlier i talked to the minister about bussing
this is the area to where there is a need for bussing and especially a great need here in iqaluit
mr chairman i would like to ask the minister if he is willing to commit to providing the necessary bussing requirements that will be required here in iqaluit in the fall
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr chairman this is a fairly complicated formula that i would also like to review
but for the meantime i would like to have ian rose answer that
chairperson
mr rose
mr rose
the funding formula for schools which makes up a large chunk of their formula are in the amounts in here
the formula is an allocation formula and it may be high and it may be low in some areas
there are a number of different variables used to calculate the money that goes to the dec s
then the dec s are free to move that money around and they move it based upon their enrolments based upon other factors
then that money can be used and moved around within each dec
they then move that money out to the dea s at the local community level
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman mr rose indicated that the regional education councils i guess they are calling them now have the authority to allocate those resources
the only way that they could do it is by taking money from other communities that need it or cutting programs
i don t think that would be acceptable
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
either one of you is going to respond
which one
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
i hear no question
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes we will commit to doing that with the divisional boards and the dec to avoid taking some money from other communities that also need it
we ll look at that

thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes we will commit to getting the enrolments as quickly as possible because we don t know how much overcrowding their will be and we don t want to take too many chances on it
chairperson interpretation

kitikmeot total 2 million 174 thousand
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairman
for the capital expenditures it looks like the keewatin got left right off the map this year
i am sure that was an oversight by the department
regarding the baker lake jonah amitnak school there was 319 thousand dollars in the capital plan for 99/00 for the planning
that has been dropped and like i indicated earlier in the week that is the oldest surviving school in nunavut and the nwt
i am wondering if the minister would consider looking at putting that money back in the budget for the design of that school next year
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
i can t commit for this year because the capital projects are not slated for this year
but i recognize that it is an old facility in need of repair and maintenance and it is also overcrowded and full but it did not meet the three criteria established for the capital plan for this year
it has to come from the government not from my department
i would like to clarify this mr chairman if i may what i am saying is because of the reduction in the capital dollars for the whole nunavut government there was a requirement to make a drastic reduction
so we made the three criteria and if it doesn t fir that then it was deferred for next year we are not saying that they would be cancelled or eliminated but they are deferred for next year
that s all we re doing
chairperson interpretation
going back to the main estimates

thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes mr chairman the recommendation to move the income support program to sustainable development is still the plan
at the moment we are handling the delivery part of the income support
this huge program and service will require both of our departments to be spending a lot of time together on how to best make a recommendation to the government to proceed with that
so it may take a little longer we cannot make it overnight because it is a huge amount of complicated time consuming process that you have to get through in order to do it properly
the minister and i recognized that
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
those are the people who can least afford any interruption in the program and i would just like to ask both ministers if they are conscious of that when they are looking at this plan
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes that was our first discussion our first concern
not only if there is disruption but miscommunication could create chaos with the clients
also there was a concern that present delivery mechanism using computers from the gnwt are not y2k compatible so we are now in a project in pangnirtung
i think it was iqaluit and ottawa
the system i think that has been since corrected
chairperson interpretation
at this time i have two names on my list
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
this 26 million 157 thousand for operations & maintenance if we look at 9 - 11 if you look at the adult basic education it is only slotted for 90 thousand
we have said that we would start using some more of our elders in our school system and if we only slot down 90 thousand i don t believe that we can get more elders into the school system
it s quite small looking at that figure when you are talking about adult basic education and literacy
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
i am not quite sure his comment had nothing to do with income support under 9 - 10
i don t believe his comments had anything to do with the discussion at hand
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
maybe i could ask this question does the income support include the details of grants and contributions under 9 - 11 and 9 - 12
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu if you go to 9 - 14 that is what you are talking about you are talking about the details of grants and contributions
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
no
chairperson interpretation
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
on page 9 - 10 it states here that grants and contributions are 25 million 724
under grants and contributions at 25 million 724 mr minister i would like clarification on what can go under grants and contributions
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes the breakdown for that is 24 million 288 thousand income support program provides payments to individuals based on family size and previous months income
approximately 13000 people about 55% of the population of nunavut are receiving that and 705 thousand contract for services provided by various hamlets across nunavut for provision of services
the last one 731 thousand for senior supplementary benefits are payments to seniors approximately 480 people at 135 dollars per month
chairperson
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman for the response i was wondering if the handicapped or special services went under grants and contributions
disabled persons and handicapped deaf or mute i thought that this grants and contributions was slotted for disabled and handicapped person mr chairman thank you
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i think that grants and contribution might be the wrong term to use
what it really means is for income support for needy families and it totals up to 25 million 724 which covers the whole nunavut area
therefore monthly payments for the needy families on a monthly basis and unemployed and elders and so on and covers the whole nunavut
chairperson
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you for that information
chairperson interpretation
since i have no more on my list total expenditures 26 million 157 thousand
no capital
total expenditures 26 million 157 thousand
some members
agreed
chairperson interpretation 9 - 11 details of grants and contributions
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to go back to the question that i asked earlier regarding the adult basic education/literacy slated for 90 thousand
if we are looking at the whole nunavut area and we are talking about adults it looks like it is way too small
i think that we have to look at it further in our budget if there is no other programs that are going to be made available for adult basic education and literacy
i would like further clarification on this point
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
mr chairman i will have ian respond
chairperson
mr rose
mr rose
thank you
there are several places where funding for adults could come in this particular item adult basic education and literacy supports community literacy projects run by local groups
for example family literacy in various places or special projects in various communities students who are enrolled in adult basic education programs at community adult ed
centres that is a program that is funded by the college and would be funded by the college contributions
chairperson interpretation
we will then go back to 9 - 11 that was for information only
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
sorry i thought we were looking at all grants and contributions are we going to be getting to 9 - 12 next and i could ask the question then
thank you
chairperson interpretation
yes we are just about on 9 - 12 and we will not move ahead unless it is agreed upon
some members
agreed
chairperson interpretation
okay then agreed 9 - 12 is details of grants and contributions
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman

thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
this aboriginal language and culture program each dec receives funding to support the regional teaching and learning centre and also produces inuktitut and inuinnaqtun materials in their original dialects
i don t have the breakdown details right now but i will provide it later if you want mr chairman chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i just note there that it says that it is to be used to provide language and cultural development right through to grade 12
i am just wondering mr chairman if in that is in fact the case where those services are being provided in high schools thank you chairperson
mr arvaluk hon james arvaluk
mr chairman for that detail i will ask ian rose to answer that chairperson
mr rose mr rose
thank you mr chairman
the money would be used through the teaching and learning centres through the dec s
they would then allocate that out on projects where they saw the greatest need in the curriculum areas whether it be at the kindergarten level at the grade 6 level junior high or senior high
they would choose and decide which projects they would want to support and move forward on
thank you
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i would just like to ask on the instructional and support services this is a large sum of money and i don t understand what that is for
so maybe i could just get a brief explanation as to what those dollars are used for
thank you mr chairman

mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman we have all heard this afternoon concerns over the school system
if this assessment has been going on i am wondering if the department has a summary of what some of these assessments of the curriculum programs in the schools have been over the past
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr rose
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk

mr tootoo mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk i will ask mr moody to answer that one monitoring
chairperson
mr moody
mr moody
thank you mr chairman
we will integrate the activities that they are doing on a cross nunavut basis and those services will in fact approximately a year from now become a part of the department of education
so yes that type of integration will improve over the next year year plus
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
back to the main estimates 9 - 12 was details of grants and contributions
agreed
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
mr chairman thank you i had my had up before regarding the employment programs there is only 300 thousand in there and i am sure that it covers the whole of the nunavut area
it looks quite small
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu must have a lot of money because he says that 300 thousand dollars is too small
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
these employment program is mostly for studies related to employment planning language of instruction long term capital planning labour market needs analysis and funding for disabled peoples for 18k
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
when you are looking at the whole nunavut area 300 thousand dollars is quite small
when we are talking about different aspects of education i have been doing that sort of stuff for a long time and it is very very hard to access funds from the government
when you apply i am sure that it is going to be quite hard to access the dollars when you have so little slotted for certain programs and i want to reiterate that 300 thousand dollars is not big
thank you
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
it is just the name that doesn t fit with what is in it
it is not for employment it is more for studies and study programs and review
for example to study school curriculum language of instruction study long term capital requirements labour market needs study and also special education needs as well as a contribution to the council for disabled persons
it is more for studies than for employment
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you for that clarification
but i think that we should be careful when we use terms for disabled persons i would suggest that we find an inuktitut terminology that describes disabled person without putting anybody down
chairperson interpretation
just a comment mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you
this 300 thousand dollars that mr iqaqrialu thinks is too small 9 - 9 so i would suggest that we move it to the clyde river total
chairperson interpretation

chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
do they not belong to the nunavut government now these dpw and all those departments are they not a part of the nunavut government now
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation

chairperson
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairman
when you were on page 9 - 13 i was a little bit distracted by the minister of health can i ask one question about 9 - 13 can i go back to it please for one question
chairperson interpretation
do you agree that mr mclean can go back to a previous page
agreed go ahead mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you i will make it quick mr chairman
early childhood programs is that the funding of day cares in nunavut and if it is where can you get the information on funding day cares because i didn t know that education funded day cares
we were always looking for funding for day cares but we didn t realize that the education department have it
could i have that information
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
yes it is to support community day care programs we support them in the communities of cambridge bay iqaluit
financial support for operations and programs
many day cares find support from other sources user fees to maintain service levels like those for communities
i will provide the member as soon as my adm comes back from gjoa haven tomorrow i guess she will start working on it
i will provide that
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i would like to thank mr mclean for going back and pointing that out
mr chairman earlier on i asked about day care funding and the assistant deputy minister indicated that the department administers this as a federal program
i would just like to ask if this is what the department receives from the federal government for the funding of day cares or is this just something that is internal from within the department
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr chairman i lost my main man who will be going to gjoa haven who would answer that level of detail question
if you will bear with me for five seconds i wonder if i could find somebody else
mr chairman can i invite glenn in the corner here so that he could answer on behalf of carmen levi
some members
agreed
chairperson interpretation
you have agreement
you may go ahead and sit at the witness table
mr sargent you may go ahead
mr sargent
thank you mr chairman honourable members
with respect to the day cares as was just explained that was just funding to subsidize the operation
there was a program from the federal government for day care that i believe is being sunsetted or closed finished completed in the year 1999-2000 and it is not a cost shared program any more
these are monies that we are not getting from the federal government any more but money from within the department to support this activity
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i think that all the members will agree with me that the availability of day care spaces
is the department is going to be looking at providing additional resources to this area and also will they be seeking to try and lobby the federal counterpart into looking into securing more resources this area
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
so all this has to be looked at
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i just want to ask a final question and is the minister staff indicated that this program was ending this year
does that mean that these dollars will not be in next year s budget or will the daycares still continue to get the required support that they need or order to stay open in the future
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
we should like to have them continued but this is a federal program
then but we believe that they should continue also
i think that s why it will be important for us to revisit that and see what other ways can this program be continued or be reactivated
maybe there is room to have discussion with the federal counterparts in this area
you know i mean we have to talk about that
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i guess this i m glad this came up because it really concerns me
if this funding is not there i m pretty sure that these daycares will not be able to operate
i urge the minister to ensure that there is funding for them in the future and also i d like to ask him if the departments the daycares have been informed
and if there is a possibility that they will not receive that funding that they do from the government in the next year in order to give them sometime to take a look at the options facing them
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr chairman i d like to make a quick correction here before it goes too far
the one million four hundred sixteen thousand in the details of grants and contributions for the early childhood program is a nunavut government
it s department money
that should continue unless if you take it off
agreed
chairperson interpretation
once we finish the nine point thirteen we will take a 10 minutes break because i m tired of sitting down
mr iqaqrialu

promoting inuit culture
mr iqaqrialu
thank you mr speaker
i would like to tell you a little story
in the past our ancestors who lived to thrive and sustain their lives
they were very hard working people
even though at times they would go through periods without food
around 1960s our inuit culture and tradition was changing
as of today now we are taking back our culture and tradition
we are now promoting and developing our own culture
i would like to state that i am very proud of that and i really appreciate that
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation thank you mr iqaqrialu

mr irqittuq

proud of inuit ministers
mr irqittuq
thank you mr speaker
i would like to tell you a story as well
when i was a small child i was told that there was a rcmp officer coming into the community
i was very scared and intimidated
i wanted to stay home and not go out
we were living in a qarmaq sodhouse and they had their own houses
it was all very foreign to us
i thought that i was going to be picked up and incarcerated by the rcmp
some of those ministers across the communities are all inuit today
even the finance minister who is not an inuk looks like one
i am so proud to have ministers who are all inuk
i would just like to say that i am very proud of that

status of question on gravel issue in hall beach
mr irqittuq
thank you mr chairman
i asked questions yesterday my question is directed to mr anawak
i asked you about the gravel issue
have you looked into that
speaker
thank you mr irqittuq
minister anawak minister of transportation
hon jack anawak
the contractors who are working on the gravel have an agreement with the department of transportation
they have to grind the gravel
they are going to be using the garage while working on the gravel
apparently they were working with the department of transportation
we are still looking into how this agreement came about
we will look at how the contract was agreed upon in hall beach
at this time i do not want to have a debate over this issue with the community at this time
i believe it is a private contractor and i understand what the issue is and what they have done to date
i still have to find out which individuals made the agreement with the organization
thank you

oral questions mr irqittuq
question 179 - 1 2
journeyman training facility for nunavut
mr irqittuq
thank you mr speaker
i do not want to take up all the time but i did campaign to represent my communities
my question to the minister of education is that there are apprentice programs for heating and electrical journey man
have you thought about getting a facility here in nunavut to do the training programs within nunavut
thank you
speaker interpretation
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
we do not have a facility as of yet
we have not decided which community this program will be held in
we used to have a program in iqaluit in the past
however as i mentioned yesterday we are in the planing process of where we are going to put the programs
we are also in the transformation process from the gnwt to nunavut on issues like training for apprentice programs
i would like to work with the ordinary mla s on these issues and i can not decide myself where i want to put these programs
i would also like to consult with the members on where we should put these programs
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions mr iqaqrialu
question 180 - 1 2
sealift earlier in the season
mr iqaqrialu
thank you mr speaker
this is for the minister of transportation
the ships come in really late during the fall when they are transporting construction materials to the communities
it is almost too late by the time it starts getting cold in the communities it is almost too late for construction
i was wondering if they could do something about transporting materials a little earlier in the summer
speaker interpretation
thank you
transportation minister mr anawak
hon jack anawak
thank you
usually when you are setting up the time lines for the shipping materials they usually do it late in the spring
there are different companies who are interested in transporting materials
we have more businesses owned by northerners who are getting into shipping materials
we can consult with them and work on how we can improve the time line for shipping
i am sure the mla s are aware that we did not have much say on how we wanted our materials shipped in the past
these are some of the problems that we have encountered before
we will hopefully have more say in the future on how the shipping is done
thank you mr chairman

thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister of sustainable development mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to first clarify that the whales are the responsibility of the department of fisheries and oceans
i was not originally aware of the issue raised by the member but the day before yesterday i authorize funds to be used for our wildlife officers to assist dfo
so according to yesterday s information the whales have been rescued already

oral questions
mr o brien
question 186 - 1 2
cost of food
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i will direct my question to the acting premier i am not sure if he is the minister responsible for the area i want to address
mr speaker recently some of us have read in the paper in this community for example they talk about the price of food
mr speaker i am not quite sure whether we have will have or could have any price controls in nunavut
we know that it is fine for people working and making a good salary they can afford to pay for the groceries but we have many people on social assistance that can t pay that $1 87 for corn
that mr speaker would be equal to about 22 dollars for a dozen corn on the cob when you would pay 2 dollars in alberta for a dozen
mr speaker is there any way that this government could get involved in trying to oversee and have a closer look at the price of food or get some control over the price of food in nunavut
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
acting premier mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it is an issue that we are aware of as a government
we quite frankly haven t looked at any of those possibilities along those lines
there has been some discussion at the very preliminary stage right now about the possibility of rent controls but it wouldn t have to do with consumer products
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr ng
oral questions
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
i guess that answer goes hand in hand with the issue that i am trying to address here it is accommodations and food
mr speaker this problem has gone on for many many years and at some point in time we have to address it
would the minister commit to following up on this to see if there is anything we could do to try to make sure that the cost of food is within reason
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
acting premier mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
so i can say that we will take a look at it and see if there are any measures that we might be able to put into place
thank you

oral questions
mr mclean
question 187 - 1 2
cost of living adjustments for social assistance
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is to the minister of health & social services but he is not here so i will direct it to the acting premier
in regards to the cost of living in nunavut we have all heard in the past year that navcanada rates have increased
that directly effects all of us in nunavut
people working can deal with this but there are the people on social assistance
is there some mechanism of this government that tracks the cost of living increases in regards to the price of food going up in nunavut and people on social assistance are pegged at a certain dollar amount every month
is there any mechanism that if the price of groceries goes up in nunavut the social assistance cheques go up at the same time
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr mclean
acting premier mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
in respect to the honourable members concern about income support rates i know that there also is what they call a food basket which is a grouping of foods that is surveyed
the survey of food identifies basic needs that are surveyed on a regular basis to see if those income support levels are meeting that basket of needs
there are adjustments that are made from time to time to reflect the increased cost of living

subsidy evaluation
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is directed to the acting premier or minister of finance
i would like to ask the minister about a topic that was talked about this morning
he listed various subsidies that are offered by the government
mr speaker i would like to know if the department of finance or the government is taking a look at exactly what we are paying out in subsidies and what we are getting for that
evaluating whether we have our subsidies in the right place
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
acting premier mr ng

nunavut share of the gnwt surplus
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i have a return to a written question asked by mr iqaqrialu on may 19th on nunavut s share of the accumulated gnwt surplus
mr speaker the 99/2000 gnwt budget indicated that because of a one time adjustment to the formula financing grant a 62 million dollar accumulate surplus was forecast for the gnwt public accounts pending march 31 1999
mr speaker because the public accounts for fiscal year 98/99 will not be finalized until the fall the actual amount of the accumulated surplus will not be know until october 1999
mr speaker the accumulated surplus will be proportioned between the gnwt and nunavut according to the agreement on the division of assets and liabilities with approximately 44% going to nunavut and the remaining 56% going to the gnwt

statement on the economy of nunavut
mr chairman i am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak to the committee of the whole on the economy of nunavut followed by a presentation on the estimates for the department of sustainable development
as a new territory in canada we are at the very beginning of a new and challenging stage in our journey
mr chairman as with all new things there are questions in peoples minds questions that we as a government must always be willing to examine and provide answers to - to the satisfaction of our people
we know for example that our people are asking questions about economic development in the new territory
they have high expectations that this new government will make a difference
there are questions from our partners in economic development
in the past year we have heard from the federal government the government of the northwest territories and from some of the inuit organizations about an economic strategy for nunavut
with the creation of this assembly mr chairman there is now an opportunity to respond on behalf of all the people of nunavut
mr chairman i also welcome the opportunity to answer those who question the very nature of our economy who question in fact the self-reliance of our people
mr chairman our economy is an exciting mix of new growth driven by markets we don t control and our traditional way of life
our connection to the land which we call the traditional economy is often overlooked by outside observers assessing nunavut s wealth and economic prospects
yet this traditional economy is strong here in nunavut mr chairman
when i speak about the development of the economy of nunavut i am speaking in terms of sustainable development
what does this mean
this means mr chairman that we recognize that the development of our economy is dependent on the land on the continuing good health of the natural environment that has sustained our people for thousands of years
sustainable development also means development that includes all our people that draws on all our talents and on the collective wisdom we have inherited from our ancestors
it is development that assures the greatest participation of our people wherever they may live in nunavut
healthy communities in nunavut
our dynamic labour force
mr chairman in nunavut people come first
we are all affected by economic activities in nunavut but in today s world we are perhaps most concerned about the economy when we reach working age
our working age population in nunavut or the number of persons aged between fifteen and sixty-four years of age is estimated to be a total of 16 433 people in this year 1999
during this government s term of office it is projected that the number of people of working age in nunavut will increase by at least 13%
we often hear that our unemployment rate is at least 22% across nunavut and much higher than that in some of our communities
i want to state here and now mr chairman that as minister of sustainable development i am committed to seeing this number reduced significantly over the term of this government
there are several reasons why i am confident that we can achieve this goal
mr chairman there are some very positive trends in nunavut that warrant mentioning
few people are aware for example that between 1991and 1996 there was a greater percentage increase in jobs in nunavut than in any other part of canada or in the country as a whole
we expect this trend to continue throughout the term of this government
we all know that employment depends on achieving higher levels of education
in the ten years between 1986 and 1996 the percentage of our adult population who left school before grade 9 has fallen from fifty-three to thirty-one per cent
at the same time the percentage of our adult population who graduated and obtained a post-secondary certificate diploma or degree has almost doubled
i do not want to force this committee to listen to a long list of statistics mr chairman
and we all know that statistics can be misleading
but it is important that we recognize that positive changes are taking place in our working age population and that we expect these changes to continue and to continue to improve
we have in nunavut a young and dynamic labour force a growing population of working age
we must view this as one of the greatest resources we possess
nunavut s mixed economy
i have said that in nunavut we have an economy that is unique in canada
our economy is a dynamic mixture of the traditional economy based on the production of food clothing and craft and new resource opportunities in tourism the fishery and minerals
mr chairman government plays a large a role in our economy
many of the employment opportunities available in nunavut are with government
but today we in this assembly we are the government
all of us here mr chairman can assure that there will be more and more opportunities for our people to take the jobs in our government and to find those jobs closer to their homes in our communities
many have called for greater diversification of our economy
i agree with them
this process is already underway
for those who question the range of activity in our economy i invite them to review the list of businesses in nunavut that is now available on the world-wide web
there you will find ample evidence of the enterprising nature of our people
here in nunavut we have
for example mr chairman in my own community in just the past few years we have begun manufacturing signs such as the one you can see today at the entrance to iqaluit from the airport
this situation is not unique to pangnirtung
the listing of nunavut businesses to which i refer contains almost four hundred individual company names in thirty-two categories of business activity
in the past two years more than one hundred and sixty businesses have registered as inuit-owned firms under article 24 of the nunavut land claim agreement
nunavut s economy today mr chairman is based on more than government jobs
i do not want to suggest here mr chairman that i am satisfied about the level of business development in nunavut
i know that in many of our communities business opportunities are limited and economic development has been slow
that is why we have retained the programs for business development we have acquired from our predecessors in the gnwt and why we are currently examining ways to make them more effective in nunavut
interpretation ends
the business incentive program is being maintained and reviewed
the business credit corporation and the community futures program will continue to provide loans to viable business enterprises in nunavut
my department will continue to support small business through grants and contributions for start-ups development of existing businesses and training
i am particularly pleased to see that program partnerships are being formed between my department and inuit organizations across nunavut
i am encouraging staff at the department of sustainable development to expand this one window approach we have seen its success at the kivalliq partners in development
i hope to see this process extended throughout nunavut during the term of this government
i am also encouraged to see the efforts made to more effectively monitor and report on the effectiveness of the programs of government and inuit organizations in our communities
people want to know where government is spending public funds on economic development and other programs
we must improve our communications to our people how to access our programs and how the money is spent over a year
mr chairman we also want to communicate to the rest of canada that nunavut has great resource potential
as was pointed out by the minister of finance in the past year alone it is estimated that more than $70 million was invested in nunavut by the mineral exploration industry
this expenditure of private funds signals to all of us that the potential for mineral development in nunavut is very promising
and it should also remind us that the source of our wealth is the land - as it has been for thousands of years and as it will be for generations to come
interpretation
when we speak about the diversification of our economy mr chairman it is to the land to the waters around us to our natural environment that we must turn our attentions
our natural environment has always provided the foundation for our mixed economy mr chairman as it will for the diversified economy of the future
whether it is through the sale of minerals furs or fish our incomes depend on the good health of our environment sorry
chairperson interpretation
we can hear english and inuktitut at the same time
can someone please fix it there we go
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation i will start again our natural environment has always provided the foundation for our mixed economy mr chairman as it will for the diversified economy of the future
whether it is through the sale of minerals furs or fish our incomes depend on the good health of our environment
as members know i have a deep commitment to the development of a sustainable marine fishery in davis strait which inuit began fishing in 1986
in the last 13 years inuit have consistently been provided with small allocations and have been shut out entirely from entering the competitive quota with the rest of canada
it will be my intention during the term of this government to vigorously pursue more equitable allocation of the resources that lie off our shores
we have demonstrated over the past several years that there are real benefits in further developing our fishery
along with obtaining access to additional quota we must urge the government of canada to invest in the research necessary to identify new fish resources
the last 13 years have demonstrated that our communities can benefit greatly from the sustainable development of our fisheries resources and my home community of pangnirtung is a good example of that
i have spoken in this assembly recently about my department s sealskin fur strategy and our work to expand markets for fur products
these programs will continue
i have also asked staff in the department of sustainable development to review the department s programs in support of harvesters
i note that nti is completing its own review of their harvesters support program and i want to see my staff working with nti staff to ensure support for traditional economic activity in nunavut is strengthened
we cannot ever forget mr chairman the importance to our people of maintaining strong ties to the land
this is our foundation for future economic development
our respect for the land and for all living things defines us a people it shapes our relationships to each other and compels us to return continuously to the sources of our collective knowledge in inuit qaujimajatuqangit
chairperson interpretation
were you planning to finish all at once
you still have a ways to go so lets break for lunch and you can complete your comments right after lunch at 1 30 pm
>>committee recessed for lunch at 12 00pm
>>committee resumed at 1 30 pm
chairperson interpretation
please take your seats
the minister was reading his opening remarks
please continue
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson i will start where i left off
toward a sustainable economy in nunavut
it is important for us to recognize that today in nunavut the government is not alone in developing the economy
there is the important role of our growing private sector
mr chairman we all know the valuable contribution made to our economy by the people who have established their own small business
there is also the contribution made by the co-operatives in our communities
i was very pleased earlier this month to recognize this contribution publicly at the co-op agm in iqaluit
the purpose of the forum was to serve as a vehicle for sharing information and ideas on our economy
it reflects the belief held by all its members that the development of nunavut s economy must be a shared responsibility
my department will continue to support the nunavut economic forum this year
some economic development programs mr chairman are delivered most effectively when they are managed not by government but by the people themselves
the transfer of economic development funds in the tourism sector to nunavut tourism is a good example
it puts the participants of the industry people who live in and work in our communities as outfitters or hoteliers or as fishing camp operators in charge of tourism development
nunavut tourism also has been successful attracting more funding from outside nunavut to our tourism industry
my department is currently engaged in a similar process with arts & crafts
the modest funding provided the nunavut arts & crafts association by my department has been used to attract more than double this amount from other sources for arts & crafts programs in nunavut
we also support community-based prospector s associations again this puts our people back into the role of developing their - in this case by participating directly in the search for minerals
we will work to improve education and training opportunities for them many of whom were born and raised in the communities they now serve
mr chairman there is a pattern to the support we are providing for economic development in nunavut today
there are some major themes emerging that will influence the development of a strategy for economic development in nunavut in the future
first among these is the participation of our people directly in the development of our economy
what we want in nunavut mr chairman is simply the chance to use our own talents and abilities and our knowledge - our culture - in the development of our community economies
we want to participate in economic activities
we want to contribute to the health and wealth of our communities
we are mr chairman a resourceful productive and self-reliant people
we are here today because our ancestors through the generations proved we have these qualities
they worked hard every day to survive in this land
they produced everything they needed for themselves and they made sure that every family got its share
because of them we have the opportunity to build nunavut
interpretation ends we must be self-reliant
we must show what we can do with our talents and resources
our families and our communities are no longer isolated one from the other
and we are no longer isolated in the world we now are nunavut part of the canadian federation and part of one of the richest nations on earth
as i said in a statement last week in this house mr chairman we must educate people outside of nunavut about our way of life
mr chairman we expect no more than to have the opportunity to show that we are productive that we can share what we have just as our ancestors did before us
working together for nunavut
mr chairman i have outlined for this committee some of the important characteristics of our economy and briefly discussed the themes that will influence our approach to economic development
now i would like to be more specific and address directly how we propose to begin to bring improvements to our economy
a nunavut jobs corps
mr chairman the development of the opportunities in the economy that i have outlined to this point must involve the full participation of our people
i have said mr chairman that our people are productive and seek more opportunities to contribute to their communities
we must remember how we all had to learn to be productive and that this process takes time and that it requires experience and maturity
we must find more ways to include young people in our work to provide them with opportunities to help their communities
in many cases these opportunities are in education
our young people make a valuable contribution to us all when they choose to stay in school
but for some this choice is not possible
they want to work in other ways
these youth too must be included in the development of our economy
they must have a role in building our future
this is why mr chairman i am proposing that this government seek the ways and means of creating a nunavut jobs corps
the development of our economic opportunities will require a skilled work force and we must provide those opportunities to those who want to be part of our economy
an mou with the government of canada
a second major area in which we can take immediate action concerns our relationship with the government of canada
the minister of finance the honourable kelvin ng has already referred in his budget address to several ways in which the federal government can work with us to bring economic development opportunities to our people interpretation
our premier took important steps in this regard at his meeting of western premier s in drumheller last week when it was agreed that the 3 northern territories would work together on an economic development agreement with canada
interpretation ends several other partnerships with federal departments are in progress
their success will be of great benefit to the development of our economy these include infrastructure development information technology a partnership on geoscience wildlife research and negotiations on the development of our fisheries
minister s forum on the economy
the first step has three parts to meet to hear all views and to begin to plan
interpretation this summer mr chairman my department will prepare and distribute to our communities our way of life an issues paper on sustainable development and the nunavut economy
we must try to answer the fundamental questions
what is the work to be done in our communities
in early december i will call upon representatives from each community together with inuit organizations governments and representatives of the private sector to meet together to discuss the results of the community meetings
conclusion
mr chairman in standing before this legislature and the people of nunavut and i want to state how proud i am to make this statement on our economy
i am proud because in preparing this statement i realized how much we as a people have to offer each other and the rest of the world
we are nunavummiut mr chairman people who for many years have managed our land and resources sustainably who have had a productive labour force and who have participated in new economies for hundreds of years
our ancestors have worked very hard to ensure that our future would be secure
in giving us a vision for nunavut they also gave us the responsibility to continue the vision and the responsibility to include all our people from innammariit to our nutarait
mr chairman realizing our vision is building a sustainable economy
it is educating people outside of nunavut on our way of life
it is providing our youth with the skills to become productive members of our communities
it is about encouraging our people to generate ideas and building on our strengths
mr chairman in short while we may have a great deal of work to do we have also done a great deal of work to get here the foundation of the nunavut economy has been laid
let us move forward with the next phase of building thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk minister of sustainable development
your presentation was very good
i will now ask mr mclean chairperson of the standing committee to read his report
oh mr minister did you have more to say
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
i wonder if i can continue with opening comments on sustainable development
chairperson interpretation
i thought you were finished
go ahead
opening comments for the 1999-2000 main estimates for the
department of sustainable development
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i am very pleased to have the opportunity to present to the committee of the whole the budget recommended for the department of sustainable development in the 1999-2000 main estimates
the department of sustainable development is a program department that touches the lives of people in our communities
when we speak of having healthy sustainable communities in nunavut we speak of three aspects of life in our communities
our environment our economy and our people
the department of sustainable development is responsible for ensuring our resources are used wisely so that they can continue to be used for our future generations
this is our mandate for the environment
we are also responsible for providing the support needed for people to pursue livelihoods both in traditional and a wage economy
this is our mandate for the economy
we are responsible for providing the support needed for people to participate fully in decisions on development
this is our mandate to our people
mr chairman i think it is important to know that this mandate is different from and more extensive than the mandate of our predecessor department in the gnwt
the proposed budget for the department is 33 095 million which represents approximately 5% of the government of nunavut budget
interpretation ends
the departments budget is organized in two main categories corporate management
which offers support functions to the department 12% of the total budget of sustainable development
sustainable development which are the program functions of the department comprising 87% of the budget
the corporate management branch is comprised of the senior management of the department deputy minister assistant deputy minister executive secretary the communications for the department financial administration and for economic research policy development and legislation
it has a recommended budget of 4 099 million dollars for this year
the sustainable development branch includes five divisions
the income support division is co-managed with the department of education
this branch has a budget of 28 966 million dollars across the five program areas of wildlife environmental protection parks trade & tourism minerals oil & gas community economic development and the directorate functions of income support
interpretation mr chairman the department s budget for 1999-2000 includes 5 400 million for wildlife management fisheries development and environmental protection
in recent years there has been a declining investment by both the government of canada and the gnwt in spending on wildlife research
interpretation ends the department grants and contributions reach into our communities through four principal means
first partnerships
on page 11 - 8 and 11 - 9 the department combines its funding with a number of outside agencies who share responsibility to the environment or the economy
example nunavut tourism and nunavut geoscience office
two sector development page 11 - 10
the department provides financial support to individuals in communities and harvesters to support their plans in the traditional and wage economy
these will be community initiatives funds grants to small business business development fund community harvesters assistance program
number three the department has budgeted 2 915 million for that purpose
number 4 grants page 11 - 11
the department provides grants of up to 5 thousand for individuals establishing or maintaining a small business or who wish to carry out fishing or prospecting activities
interpretation in this initial year of operation our ability to introduce new programs is constrained however i have made provision through reallocation of budget categories to increase support for key areas of our economy
first in the arts and crafts we have budgeted 100k in support of the nunavut arts and crafts association
secondly we have budgeted 450 thousand dollars toward a partnership with the government of canada for the establishment of a nunavut geoscience office
as members know the foundation of the mining industry is exploration
chairperson interpretation
just a moment
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i don t think we have a quorum
i think it is less than half of the number needed to have a full meeting
just to remind you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
we don t have a quorum at this time so we will take a few minutes break to ask the other members to return to the house five minutes
>>committee recessed at 2 02 pm
>>committee resumed at 2 10 pm
chairperson interpretation
we have a quorum now we can start again
when we are listening to the presentation this is a very important issue i urge the members not to leave the chamber
i am urging you to stay in the chamber mr kilabuk you may continue
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we still have to get used to the term ikupiktulirijikkut
i will just continue on from where i was
page 5 thirdly under contract services we have set aside 50 thousand to pursue increased allocations to nunavut from offshore fisheries
this is a subject of great concern to me and i am very committed to seeing that nunavut be given greater attention in the allocation of the fisheries resources that lie off our shores
finally and most importantly mr chairman on the strength of a recently evaluation of nunavut tourism i have increased their core funding this year by 1643 thousand dollars
nunavut tourism has committed to strengthening their communications with their members in the communities and with their work in developing new tourism products for nunavut
i have provided for this in their 1999-2000 core funding interpretation ends
mr chairman as i have indicated it is my intention to vigorously pursue an agreement on an economic strategy with the government of canada
i trust that i will be able to report in the days ahead of traditional investment money being made available to support continued and sustainable growth in the nunavut economy
one final note under grants and contributions is worthy of mention
mr chairman it is my belief that we must encourage our youth to pursue an education in the sciences commerce and in the traditional economy if we are going to develop home-grown talent for this department
to this end i have set aside 30 thousand in scholarships for young people who wish to further their education in the science commerce and the traditional economy
the department currently has about 82 positions filled out of its total staff complement of 135 positions
of those filled positions 33 or 40% are held by inuit
the department s current vacancy rate for staff is 40%
interpretation mr chairman the budget of my department is relatively small
our mandate however effects everyone in nunavut and touches on issues that are of great concern to our people the health of our land our economy and our communities
with a limited budget this broad mandate can only be effective through developing effective partnerships with the government of canada with nunavut tunngavik incorporated with the business community and with our harvesters

mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
when he did his opening remarks that nunavut residents have been bypassing the department
what does that mean what did you mean when you said that at the beginning
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
minister of sustainable development mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
perhaps i mistranslated it if perhaps i could ask the member to identify where that comment is made in the presentation paper
chairperson interpretation
mr nutarak
mr nutarak
when you were under mining exploration that you stated that there are entities already existing
water board impact review board which the companies have to go through to get approval so i was wondering if that was in line with that
chairperson interpretation
minister of sustainable development or your official can respond
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes i found it on page four
what i was trying to say is that our economy is dependent on the land and we should be using the traditional economy
we have not been using the traditional economy up to our potential in the communities
we have to find traditional ways to enhance the economy in the communities because other people outside of nunavut have overlooked the traditional economy
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
how are we going to deal with the outsiders overlooking nunavut s wealth and economic prospects
chairperson interpretation
minister of sustainable development
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
perhaps when the researchers come in they overlook the traditional economy
i don t know how many times we have met with officials we have reiterated about the traditional economy each time we meet with these officials
this is part of the nunavut economy so it has been overlooked by outsiders so we would like to include this in our overall economy
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister of sustainable development
the members may identify if they have any questions or comments so i can put your names down on the list
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i have a few questions in regards to the ministers opening statements
that s what i was doing when i wasn t here i was trying to review it in a little more detail
in the comments that were just made on our traditional economy i am wondering if the minister knows or the department knows what percentage of our territorial products are from that sector of our economy
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister of sustainable development if you wish to respond
hon peter kilabuk
inaudible
chairperson interpretation
hold on your microphone is not on
go ahead
i am sorry that i had to stop you but one of the members couldn t hear the translation
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
as i was trying to say we knew that this was going to be brought up but i will be working with the nwmb and we were to make an announcement about what our decisions were
i can only say it is between 20 and 40 million the money that is being made from northerners that would traditionally have been in the north
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
did you have another question
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister of sustainable development did you have a comment
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to make a clarification about what i had said about this survey
it has been ongoing for two years and it is going to continue for another five years
we are just trying to find out now how beneficial this is for the northerners
we won t know until we have some statistics what our targets are
we won t know that until the survey and the tracking is done
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo did you have another question or comment
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess i am trying to put it in a way that we might be able to get a response
traditionally in most territories provinces and countries they have a target for what they would like to see in manufacturing services those types of industries
does the department have targets in these areas and what they would like to see not only in those areas but also in the traditional economy area as well
thank you mr speaker
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
i am not mr speaker i am just a chairperson
minister of sustainable development you wanted to respond to that
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
as i indicated earlier that is all i can say at this time
now the traditional economy should be i can t say what it should be
we haven t as a department set any targets that the member is talking about
chairperson interpretation
mr minister
mr tootoo did you have something else
go ahead
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
sorry about that error there
mr chairman i d like to just ask in his statement the minister states that he s committed this thing seeing the number of unemployment employment rate reduced significantly over the term of this government
does the department have any again target figures that they d like to see or is it just a general statement and targets will be figured out down the road
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister of sustainable development
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
as i said earlier in my opening remarks we want more young people getting higher education so that unemployment levels would be reduced whether it be in traditional economy or in 9 to 5 jobs
if more took advantage of education system and taking on the opportunities that are offered in private and in public sectors
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo did you want to say something else
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman also i guess this is something that i learned and the minister s statement said that between 1991 and 1996 there was a greatest percentage of increase in jobs in nunavut than any other part of canada
i m just wondering mr chairman does that increase equal the increase in population in that area because to me it would the population rate increases faster than the job rate
it s not really doing anything
so i m just wondering if there has been a look at that comparison as to whether its keeping up with the population growth as well
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister of sustainable development
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we have not had a per se tracking of that
but when we re looking at the job availability in nunavut that s all we looked at not the way you re saying
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr minister
i want to talk about the business side of the operation in community futures program where they provide loans to viable businesses in nunavut
mr chairman i wondered if the department has given any thought to these services and the economies in the communities be increased through the provision of financial services in the communities like banking type services in the community
i m wondering if that s something that the department is looking at
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister or your deputy minister may respond
go ahead
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the department is mandated to undertake such programs but it has not been started
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo did you have something else
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman just a comment on that
if there were those types of services available in communities that are and i ll use an example of what i m familiar with is a credit union system locally owned and operated within a community
that would enable those businesses and ventures to be able to utilize those services again freeing up dollars that the department or the government would have to put into that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister if you want to respond to that comment
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
what he was talking about is known
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo did you have something else
thank you mr tootoo
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
i think it s one of our salvations is to see this happen a mine open
a mine in my community or close to my community would have a tremendous impact
i believe that it would help if some kind of a central location and we heard this word thrown around for the last number of years one stop shop i thing we should probably get rid of that one
it didn t seem to really have any impact
how would his department make this situation somewhat easier to encourage enhanced mining exploration and mining development in nunavut
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr minister of sustainable development
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
as i mentioned earlier in my opening comments i think that we have the poorest administration of exploration in nunavut
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien did you have something else
mr o brien
no mr chairman i believe what the ministers saying that they re just looking into this now and that they don t have anything concrete at this time but hopefully down the road in the future we will
i m not saying anyway that we should be doing favours to anybody especially the mining companies
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister of sustainable development did you wish to add anything
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
yes thank you mr chairman
we agree that we need to streamline the mining administration in the north and if its going be really hard to get various permits and licenses i think that we would be that would be detrimental to employment
i think i ll ask my deputy minister to further respond to that
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
ms trumper if you want to make additional comments
ms trumper
mr chairman i will offer a little bit background on what we have done to prepare for this year in the mining industry
we just completed a survey to all mining exploration companies operating in nunavut
they were written by the department and asked to comment on the very thing that you re talking about
how easy is it for you to operate in nunavut
we had a fairly good response in that survey and identified some of the areas that they have concerns about in terms of setting up operations in nunavut
we re in discussion with nti on creating a one channel through which mining companies can operate and with the nunavut impact review board and finally i should note that the geo science initiative
which the minister mentioned in his opening remarks is intended to get at this problem that mining companies have identified and that is there is just not a good enough information base on what resources are in nunavut
so that initiative this year is to try to catch up to the other jurisdictions in canada who have considerably better geographic science data base than we do
chairperson interpretation
thank you deputy minister of sustainable development
mr o brien are you done or would you like to make further comments
mr o brien
no that s fine mr chairman
thank you and i thank the minister and his deputy for their response
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairman
these are just my comments
i ll get into questions on line by line
outside investment to me is very very important for the economy in nunavut
how do we attract that outside investment
whether its joint partnerships which i would encourage or whether its non-renewable resources sector or even the renewable resource sector like fishing and seal pelts and caribou pelts and things like that
i think there should be some alliances made with provinces
green or environmental friendly and stuff like that so we have a health environmentally friendly products here in regards to that
internal investment maybe i know that this is not your department it should be maybe the minister of finance s
but there is a lot of flow of dollars a tremendous amount of dollars from people living here going south to bank accounts and mortgages and things like that
there is nothing to retain the wealth that s given to this territory and it s also what used to happen in the northwest territories
nothing is here to retain the wealth that s given to us so we can keep it to reinvest it and build up equity in nunavut nunavut tourism
unemployment rate
and like i say i don t know who s responsible for bringing these unemployment rates but they re totally incorrect as far as i m concerned
i think we re getting to a point in nunavut now that we probably have 3 categories of communities
and then we have decentralization coming which is going to help communities like mine that have an unemployment rate of 60 or 70% full-time that going to help
but what about smaller communities
what about grise fiords or chester field inlets the whale coves the clyde rivers in places like that that don t have decentralization directly affecting them 40 or 50 jobs moving into the community
they should be treated a bit differently
they should be given a little bit more care and funding when it comes to economic development in regards to economic development there is one thing that i want you to remember
the largest employer the second largest employer of people in nunavut is the private sector
and sometimes we don t recognize as a private sector enough for their commitment into investing money into their own community and into nunavut
so i want you to remember that the private sector is the second largest support business for people support of employees in nunavut
i know we have edo s in all our community and most of them are local and bilingual and they can explain this process
that s okay if you re in an area of 600 thousand people
if you got some person that wants to bip because they need it they ve got these massive amounts of forms
and the other thing i want to know its been puzzling me a lot in the last year or two is how this bip and article 24 mesh together to benefit everybody
like article 24 is something else
but in the region that i come from article 24 is a big deal
and it s going to come up in the future how this meshes together
that s it for me thank you mr minister
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
your comments are understandable and clear
minister of sustainable development
care to respond
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you
i know that you made some comments but no questions but i ll go ahead and answer
anyhow i ll give you a good example on how nunavut government enter into negotiations in terms of trade and selling traditional products
i concur with your concerns that we have to look at all these measures their agreements and our programs within my department and the business incentive policy are confusing and not quite clear
i know that s because it s being controlled and managed by two bodies but this fall this incentive policy will be reviewed
i would like to thank you for your comments and thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister of sustainable development
mr mclean s supplementary
thank you
perhaps we can take a break a 15 minute break
>>committee recessed at 3 04 and resumed at 3 23pm
chairperson interpretation there is only 8 we need 10
there is only 8 members
we now have a quorum
mr irqittuq was the next one to ask questions
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
before i ask my question i d like to make a statement
the minister of sustainable development in his opening remarks mentioned fisheries
but at this time in our communities it is kind of hard to sell fish at this time and i know that we have commercial fisheries
i d like to see some kind of research done or a marketing promotion done to do commercial fishing to sell our fish to certain southern markets
i was down south a little while back some of the hotels or businesses that i asked whether they would like to buy some fish and they were very encouraged and eager to buy our arctic char
i m wondering what the red tape is in selling our fish to the southern markets
they can only provide so much quota according to the research being done the lakes in our communities
economic development in our communities is something you have to really work for
we haven t really found anything that is worthwhile to sell from our communities
there is very low market for inuit carvings arts and crafts and the arctic co-ops were buying and selling carvings but that when we down because due to the lack of poor carvings
they weren t satisfied with the quality of the carvings so they stopped selling
buying and selling our carvings had really destroyed our economy in our communities
i wanted to mention that first its more of a comment and not a question
i have question
few questions first of all the allocation of these main estimates
the hamlet economic development officers in nunavut have been allocated 2 million eight hundred thirty-five dollars
how are you going to distribute those allocations
per capita
how is the formula financed
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
we re going to be getting into the financial departments or financial main estimates but perhaps the minister of sustainable development or the deputy minister would like to respond
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
you mentioned the fisheries and its nothing new to me
i ve really experienced the red tape and road blocks that we encountered in pangnirtung
i m going to answer your question first
i d really like to talk about fish but i ll answer your question
we have reports on fisheries if you re interested
the allocation of funds that s going to be distributed to the hamlets for community economic development officers
for example the larger communities follow the person year full-time person year
the smaller communities will be given a half time person year
chairperson interpretation
mr irqittuq anything else
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you
so i won t be talking about anything to do with finances right now but i ll ask later
thank you mr chairman
mostly a comment i d like to make
some problems that we encountered when we were under the government of the northwest territories and i m sure it s going to be amended by this present government
i mentioned this before i ve talked about it a lot since it s got to do with business
the gnwt s business incentive policy stated earlier we were using gnwt business incentive policy and now we re the nunavut government
the policy is not compatible to nunavut
there had been a lot of problems encountered with those business incentive policy
if i m going to be using nunavut government s money if i wanted to buy something we would have to apply
i would have to make an application using the gnwt application forms if i wanted to buy a vehicle
i m sure we re going to have to use the gnwt forms before we buy anything from outside the government of nunavut
for example the kingland ford vehicles that the government purchases
if we had to buy construction materials or things like that for nunavut government according to bip of the gnwt we have to use those certain private businesses
if and when the government of nunavut looks into amending the bip i think that we should look for companies who are cheapest or who have cheaper estimates or budgets materials
i think we should be able to purchase materials or do contracts with the cheapest company
we have to think about article 24 as well
i d really like to encourage you to work really hard in trying to make this easier for nunavut
this was just a comment
mr chairman when we go to main estimates i ll have some more questions
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister of sustainable development would you like to respond
hon peter kilabuk
thank you
you stated that it was a comment
just to clarify a bit
what we ve found out to date in the whole of the nwt the different private businesses in the nwt are in the area of 2 100 there are 381 private sector businesses in nunavut
this business incentive policy is being used in nunavut at this time that was used in the previous government
we re going to be reviewing it this summer
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
i don t have anything else from the floor
anybody else from the floor
mr irqittuq would you like to take the chair
chairperson - mr irqittuq interpretation
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman my question is in cape dorset last october carvers and private business our museums there was an arts and crafts council established by these organizations and i m wondering whether the nunavut government will be supporting this organization
there were going to be board members comprising this organization who would be reviewing any arts and crafts policies
have you heard about that
chairperson interpretation
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
during my opening remarks the nunavut arts and crafts council we mentioned that we wanted to work with this inuit art foundation
we ve been helping them with grants and contributions
they made an official proposal and we ve been able to provide them with grants
chairperson interpretation
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
this art foundation that is in place as an official board
have you talked with them recently
chairperson interpretation
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you
sorry mr chairman
they haven t set up a date yet to hold a meeting but they re working on the business plans right now
thank you
chairperson interpretation
is that it
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i have a very important question to ask concerning mining
yesterday there was a letter read stating concerning different contracts in nunavut government
as residents of nunavut we don t have any mining companies or exploration companies that are placed in nunavut
these exploration and mining construction companies come from down south and they re not from nunavut
these contracts are huge especially in the mining field
these contracts will be directed to nunavut and i m sure were going to encounter some problems
have you had discussions about this
chairperson interpretation
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
speaker sorry chairman
i can t say very much right now about this
i know there is no mining company here in nunavut
these mining companies or exploration companies use their own funds to do prospecting or do geological surveys
those exploration companies who like do to some mining in our communities or exploration make a request to do so if its going to be under 5 000 dollars
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
i do not like hearing that there isn t going to be any mining companies established in nunavut
my ears don t like that
it s just as an organization and as inuit people we can become one of we can establish our own mining company and be a competitive company in the world
i m sure were going to have to look towards building our own mining companies
mining exploration generates a lot of money
as a nunavut resident we d like to be able to benefit economically from mining because there is a lot of iron ore in our resources in our lands
it can be very economically viable for us
if we re just going to be receiving royalties from that we re going to have to think about as mlas we re going to have to be thinking about how we can improve our economy
by establishing a company or a corporation that will be situated and placed in nunavut there is a lot of money to be made
it s just a comment i d like to make
i ll have something else to say after
chairperson interpretation
would you like to respond
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
as i mentioned in my opening remarks that you mentioned about contracts that we don t have mining companies here
we don t have any mining companies as yet
as i mentioned these private sectors mining companies use their own funds to do exploring
if and when we can establish our own mining company then we can do the developing
that s all i can say for now
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you
it s very interesting
i like your response
i use to think that of the gnwt how come as residents of nunavut we can t get a mining company of our own
i use to think that
i think its our land
we should be the ones exploring our lands
we can make a lot of money through mining
that could generate a lot of money for nunavut and that s a very important thing for the people of nunavut
i m going to have another question
chairperson interpretation
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i just understood this you were talking about having our own mining company i was thinking more like a government official
i was thinking about that the department s economic development so i apologize for that first
for those people wishing to develop or establish a mining company i would definitely encourage people to start up their own companies to do mining like in kitikmeot
there has already been development plans in running your own business for mining business
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
remind me when my time is up
concerning different contracts that will be coming out of your department for economic development because that s always the case when there is economic development and you ll be granting contracts in nunavut
there are a lot of potential businesses that could be established
those contracts that you grant to businesses i m sure it s obvious that you ll have to allocate these contracts for businesses outside of nunavut
have you thought about this as well encouraging small businesses
chairperson interpretation
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
yes thank you mr chairman
yes within our department s operations i know that there is a huge contract allotted in my department
they will continue with the existing contracts that were inherited with the existing companies
some of the contracts so that some of the contracts that were in place with the gnwt so that they could continue
i know we know where the situation is
we know where it is going also
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
another question
we would like to encourage private businesses to be established since your department is the supporter of initiating businesses with the previous government
it was pretty hard to initiate your own private businesses with all the bureaucracy that you had to go through when applying for fund to start your own business
if i stated that there was an inuktitut unilingual speaking people will you allow them to apply in your system
will you make your system accessible so that the inuktitut unilingual speaking people can apply to your department for business support
if we are going to treat everybody equally that will have to come up within your system which is evident i was wondering if you had those kinds of plans in your department
chairperson interpretation
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you
in regard to the public making applications i know it was pretty hard for some inuit people to apply for funding and sometimes it had discouraged potential applicants from applying for incentive dollars
we are now accumulating and collecting and reviewing the system
the residents of the communities from the public if they re going to be applying for funds they will go through the economic development officer in the communities
some will be free of charge
some will be just grants and some will be loan
in regards to getting staff members who are bilingual people the community economic development officers in the communities are 85% inuit and 15% are non-inuit
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman for your appropriate answer
i m smiling away here now
however i would like to ask another question as a nunavut resident
somebody had asked that question in regards to finances about the co-ops wanting to establish credit unions
i want you to know that not all the communities in nunavut have co-ops established so we will not be able to reach all the communities with your proposal
perhaps we should find a better means or other ways of means for those communities that don t have co-ops
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
at this time for the communities that have requested a credit union they go through the co-op i know it s entirely true that not all the communities in nunavut have co-ops
if this can go ahead before it does go ahead we will review it as to how we can find other means for the communities that don t have co-ops
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
when we go to the main estimates i know that i ll be asking many more questions but i have no further questions
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to ask this question
i don t know how many people deal with wildlife issues
nunavut government wildlife department there are many wildlife departments there is the nwmb there are regional wildlife boards and there is a wildlife function in your department
so i am afraid there might be confusion
i would like to get clarification as to how that relationship works
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you
for the department of sustainable development the wildlife officers are the enforcers of the law and they also work on environmental issues to protect the environment
the wildlife officers also work on conservation areas
thank you
chairperson
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
the reason i asked this question is because of the regulations
for example the polar bear regulations are the responsibility of the nwmb which i am sure that they have set the guidelines and regulations for polar bears
if the community had any concerns in regards to that when they ask your department will you just pass the buck to them
thank you
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you
at this point in regards to polar bear research it is still the responsibility of the department of sustainable development and we are still seeking direction from the nwmb and we advise the nwmb
thank you
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i have a few questions after hearing some comments
mining was mentioned as one of the things that is important to look at and also the development prior to mining coming in the exploration phase
i am not an expert on exploration but i would venture to guess that it is a rather specialized area
i know that there had previously been some training and development in the kivalliq region and in this area
i am just wondering if there are any plans to continue with training in this area in nunavut
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
we do have a budget for nunavut exploration
we have set aside some funds 102 thousand dollars for exploration use
thank you
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
another thing with mining as the minister made quite clear in his statement is that it effects our land
the land is one of the most important resources and once it is used up it is something that never comes back
mr chairman i would like to ask the minister i know that in his statements he talks about a balance between the protection of the land and economic development
i know and i have seen cases where one can go in with the best intentions of working out a compromise when it comes to this type of development
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
yes thank you
the nunavut impact review board has been established and implemented
the applications go to the impact review board from the companies
thank you
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i don t totally understand this
pardon my ignorance
are you saying that it goes through the board and they approve the development or not
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr arvaluk you have a point of order
hon james arvaluk
pardon me if i am wrong
i think the question is more to do with the legislation or regulation issues not in the budget rather maybe in october maybe in the legislation session
correct me if i am wrong
chairperson interpretation
at this point we don t know if his comments are in line with the department system or what you are saying
but you may go ahead
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i don t need a response to that right now but it is just something that i had thought about as the discussion went along with mining
i wouldn t mind if i could get a reply to that in the future
going on to the bip policy that a member talked about earlier
along with that there was a policy called a northern manufactured goods policy
i am just wondering if that has also been brought over from the gnwt to the government of nunavut
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
yes thank you
i apologize mr tootoo this was cut off as only one firm was covered
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman throughout the ministers statement it talks about the need to try and retain dollars in nunavut and that is something that i firmly believe in as well
it just wouldn t put them on the same level playing field with someone manufacturing these products in the south
i am just wondering if that is something that the department will look at
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
at this time we still won t get any legislation geared toward individuals things
but i also want to assure you that we will be looking into and reviewing this issue this coming fall
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
if i could go back to the ministers comments on the fact that the manufactured goods policy was a one-time thing
if that is the case i thought it was a policy along with part and parcel with the business incentive policy
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i was getting whispered to by my deputy minister from what the interpreters were saying
we can t make legislation that deals with only one person
i would like to inquire what the interpreters said because i didn t hear all of the question
i would like him to repeat it
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
i was just referring to your comments earlier about the northern manufactured goods policy being a one time thing
i am under the understanding that it was a policy that was part and parcel of the business incentive policy geared towards northern manufacturers
if that makes it a little bit clearer i just wanted to provide some clarification
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
regarding the question that you are talking about i think my deputy minister was part of the review team
perhaps i should ask her to reply to this question
chairperson
ms trumper
ms trumper
mr chairman in adopting the bip on an interim basis for nunavut they looked at the policy and the gnwt had added to the bip policy two or three directives
one was the commercial accommodation directive which directed contractors doing business with the government to stay in commercial accommodations
the other one was the northern manufacturers directive which you were speaking about
they have taken that out of bip with the intention of examining those as stand-alone policies
but that would fall into the department of public works so i can t speak with definition on where they are in that process now
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i can understand the response but i think again if you look at the larger picture you want to encourage development in this area not only here but in any community arviat baker anywhere
there is no way that any company or individual or firm could be able to compete at the same level as a southern manufacturer
so i am just asking and i am encouraged to hear that it is something that is going to be looked at as a separate policy
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we have an interim business incentive policy which came from gnwt and it is due for a review in october
we are not certain who is going to be responsible for these policies and we ll just stay with the old gnwt policies and directives in the meantime
i can t tell you right now which way it is going to be done but we ll do that by october
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
i have two speakers mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in your opening remarks you mentioned article 24 and that this would be incorporated into your department and we can t go any other way because it is under the nunavut land claims agreement
article 24 states that it is only when a company is 51% owned by a northern company then the article would apply if it is not 51% northern owned then they cannot be registered or qualify for these incentives
there are many companies who are not 51% owned
if this is going to be the case then we have to communicate this policy very explicitly to the residents of nunavut
according to the figures that you were quoting in your opening remarks so are you going to adhere to that policy or are you looking for a new policy
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes it is true what you are saying
it has to be very clearly communicated to the people
our department can assist in communicating this policy to the residents of nunavut
a company has to be 51% owned by inuit or northerners
we have to communicate this to the public and it is the department s intention to do that whether it be in a different department or not
thank you
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
there are many companies which are not 51% owned by inuit
as the department of sustainable development for those companies under 51% you won t be able to do anything for them or require them to adhere to article 24
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the question was more complicated than it sounded but the way it is set up right now if they are under 51% we can t require them to do anything
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
yes it is true i know this answer to be true
my other question is for the department of sustainable development they are also responsible for renewable resources or wildlife
as the minister that is under your portfolio
there are hunters and trappers organizations in the communities and they have had no say in who gets the study funds for wildlife studies
sometimes the government just goes ahead and approves a project that is going to have an impact in the communities without going through the hunter/trapper organizations
are you going to be revisiting that area
chairperson
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the studies on wildlife studies are one of the most important things that we do as a department
some of the decisions are based on a lot of the studies that are conducted in the north
i would like everyone to understand the same thing and the people that we want to work with we expect them to live by their commitments and to share the information that they get
with the groups that we are working with they have to exercise their power as well and the requirements have to be followed and our department will be working closely with the effected organizations
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
so the people who are proposing to work with you would you be providing them with funds to conduct studies for you or do they have to apply for funding from somewhere else
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
that will depend on the proponents
we would look at the proposal we can agree or not agree and we will have people on staff that will deal with specific areas so that everybody is treated equally and given the same consideration
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu you are running out of time
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
i will try to make this short i don t think that i will be able to ask all of the questions that i want to ask
thank you mr chairman
the hto in my community if they requested funds or wrote up a proposal to do a study would you then work with that organization and give them the funds to carry out that study
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
it would depend on what the proposal was
if they requested funds and didn t provide the details i don t think they would get the funds
this is the same for any organization or any community or individual
if there is a proposal and it is viable then it would be considered
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
i think that our hto has been proposing to do studies on whales
if the hto wrote a proposal to do that study would you give them the funds to carry out that study
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
it would depend on what kind of study they would want to do because whales fall under the dfo which is under the government of canada
we would have to look at their proposal and we would respond appropriately
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
yes i understand
thank you
i think that i am out of time thank you mr chairman

is it in these grants & contributions that the dollars are allocated to the business development fund and programs that lend money to businesses starting up
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
did you want your financial comptroller to come to the table
is that your financial manager
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
mr chairman he is our finance officer maybe he should join us at the table he has those details
chairperson interpretation
okay he can come up
mr kilabuk if you could introduce the new person joining you at the table

thank you mr chairman
this year there has been an amount approved at the recent kimmirut retreat and this amount has been set aside for 1 1 million
it is within this fund that the department would be delivering the activity
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess after thinking about it i asked the wrong question
i guess i should have asked i would imagine that the outstanding balances from the past business credit corporation would be factored into the division of assets and liabilities within the region
i am just wondering if you can maybe give me some information on that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation thank you mr chairman
i will ask our finance our finance guy will have to work for his money so i am going to ask him to reply to that
mr martin
again that is subject to the finalization of the agreement on division of assets and liabilities
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess in any loan portfolio that is out there there is always a provision for write off s in there
mr chairman out of this 7 million i am wondering is it perceived that we will get that 7 million or is there some of it out there that we will not be able to collect
thank you mr chairman 0
chairperson interpretation
go ahead mr martin
mr martin
thank you mr chairman
with regards to the 7 million loan portfolio as part of the asset and liability division process there is significant interest being taken in write-off procedures
so it is anticipated that the preliminary 7 million estimate being provided would reflect all of the appropriate write downs for year end
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation

detail of grants & contributions mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairman
in regards to the community initiative fund is that what we refer to on page 11 - 10 as the cip fund
my colleague brought it up earlier under the grants and contributions in regards to training for mineral development
we have presently 2200 people enrolled in school elementary and secondary school in keewatin
there is the potential for two gold mines to open up in the keewatin within the next 2 - 5 years
with those two gold mines comes approximately 500 jobs 500 jobs times an average of 80 thousand dollars a year works out to quite a few dollars
from those jobs comes taxes that go right back to the federal government
the price that was put on the diamond mine in yellowknife was a billion dollars in taxes and royalties that flows to the federal government and that the nwt does not get
what i am getting to here is that the department of education is responsible for the children in k - 12 arctic college is responsible for other training in regards to adult basic education and other things
it is open pit mining you are going to need roughly 200 heavy equipment operators you re going to need roughly 50 - 60 cooks you re going to need labourers to build the mine
there is no money identified in the budget anywhere or very little of it to train a work force starting now for when these mines are on the go
there is hardly anything identified
what we call it in the keewatin is pre-mining training and it covers a broad base
thank you
chairperson
his question is lengthy
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i ll ask my deputy minister to answer that
chairperson
ms trumper
ms trumper
thank you mr chairman
the member is correct there is nothing specific in the budget for ramping up to the two good gold mine prospects in the keewatin
i think this is something that the time has come with the two projects advancing as quickly as they are in the keewatin
and it is something that could be built into the discussion that the department is now having with diand on an economic strategy discussion which we hope will have some definition to it in the next six months
it has been a long process with them so far
chairperson
mr mclean
briefly

gjoa haven gathering
hon paul okalik
mr speaker i rise today to thank the people of gjoa haven for their wonderful hospitality yesterday
as you are aware i had the honour of travelling to gjoa haven with mr puqiqnak mr alakannuark and ministers thompson and picco to attend the kitikmeot leaders forum
i am pleased to inform this house mr speaker that the meeting was very productive
elected mla s and cabinet ministers sat down and discussed issues of concern with elected mayors councillors and representatives from inuit organizations
the mayors were able to inform us of their concerns and we were able to provide an update on our direction
in gjoa haven we had frank discussion on a number of different issues
my colleague the minister of health and social services was able to provide the kitikmeot leaders with an update on the plans for the dissolution of the health and social services boards
my colleague minister thompson discussed the gjoa haven gas issue
as a team we discussed capital plans with some of the mayors
mr speaker we may not have agreed on every issue but i think that the discussions themselves are what are important
this government is committed to decentralization not only in terms of jobs but also in terms of governance
mr speaker i would like to commit to the people of nunavut that we as a government will continue to work closely with hamlet councils and regular mla s to ensure that the needs of nunavummiut are met
mr speaker i have the utmost confidence in our leadership in nunavut
again mr speaker i would like to thank the people of gjoa haven for their wonderful hospitality

congratulations to graduates
hon james arvaluk
mr speaker i wish to take this opportunity to congratulate all the nunavut graduates of 1999
their hard work and determination has taken them this far and will lead them into the future
this group are the first graduates in our new territory of nunavut
they are also the last to graduate in this millennium
just as great hope and possibilities extend before us in nunavut we hold great hope for these young people
as the geese are in flight again across our vast land i hope that they will take time to consider their new flight plans and new directions
i also encourage them to take advantage of further training opportunities
however like the geese who always return i look forward to each one of these graduates eventually taking their places as leaders and builders of nunavut

mineral accord
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
nunavut in particular the keewatin region has some of the richest mineral deposits in canada
but unfortunately with the prices of gold at a low the exploration and mine activity has decreased for the time being
mr speaker while the market is in this soft stage i strongly support suggest that the government of nunavut should be advancing a mineral accord with diand and the federal government
there are many benefits to such an accord such as the royalties
this would greatly assist this government with its future capital projects
let s not let this opportunity slip away from us as it did in the former government
mr speaker let s not allow the multi-million dollars in royalties slip away from our grasp that nunavut needs so badly
thank you

lessons learned during first sittings
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i am pleased to speak this morning at possibly our last sitting of the spring session
our next session will take place in the fall

over the course of the 17 days of this sitting i believe that we have all learned a great deal together i certainly have mr speaker
i would especially like to acknowledge our two deputy chairs of the committee of the whole the member from amittuq who took no time at all in learning how to speed up the members like myself
the procedures of the assembly are still new to a lot of us but i believe that those of us who are new to the assembly ministers and regular members are rapidly becoming comfortable in our roles
i would like to commend my honourable colleagues for the way in which they have adapted so impressively to their new roles as members of this legislative assembly
while we should feel a sense of accomplishment in having passed nunavut s first budget and major pieces of legislation we have been candid over the past two weeks in expressing some of our frustrations
it is to be found in what our constituents say to us
from talking with my constituents i know that they are paying attention to the coverage that this house receives
the degree to which open honest dialogue and debate takes place around this table reflects on us all
i look forward to working with all my colleagues throughout the summer and to talking with my constituents as we prepare for our next sitting in the fall and the hard work that lays ahead for all of us

question 189 - 1 2
status of whales stuck in sea ice
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is in regards to some narwhals that were stuck near grise fiord i was wondering if the government is doing anything about this
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr kilabuk minister of sustainable development
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we are presently looking into the matter
there are narwhals that were stuck near grise fiord and the wildlife officers are presently trying to free them
on may 27th the hunters located the narwhals that were stuck due to the ice and they requested funding to fund the saving of the narwhals
from the community there were four bodies that were given reports they were about 20 - 40 metres from the community
another one was 700 meters away from the community there were approximately 9 dead narwhals and some were eaten previously by polar bears
there were about 9 polar bears that were sighted near the stuck narwhals
they were approximately away from the floe edge there were 17 narwhals attacked by the polar bears and as they were injured the hunters wanted killed them as they felt sorry for them
the meat was distributed to the surrounding communities for the people to eat so the meat was not wasted
they had to save the narwhals fearing that the polar bears would attack them again
there have been four breathing holes fixed by the hunters and currently the funds that we provided will be used to open up more breathing spaces so the narwhals will be able to survive
the community hunters and trappers association was carrying out this work as well as the wildlife officer who is monitoring and acting as the information officer for the project sigluk akeeagok
also from my department they are using our equipment and also we are providing 4 thousand dollars through the nwmb so that the money will be used to pay the hunters for their work and for our equipment
also yesterday there was 1 thousand dollars donated and the money will be used to monitor the trapped whales
this was agreed to and they will be requesting further assistance as the need arises
also mr speaker the hto and the hunters have been working very hard to save the whales and we are very proud of them for the efforts that they are making

oral questions
mr puqiqnak
question 191 - 1 2
travel assistance for inuit broadcasting corporation
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question i am not sure which minister i should be directing it to
i think it should be directed to the minister of communications
my question is that in my community the inuit broadcasting corporation are headquartered out of taloyoak and i am proud that they have a branch over there
but my question is that there are five communities in the kitikmeot region and ibc work in taloyoak and they are responsible for all of the five communities
we have requested that they attend our community and take footage of our community and we want to see them covering the whole region because their work is very important but their travel budgets are limited
how are they being funded for these kinds of projects
speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
minister responsible for public works telecommunications & technical services ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
ibc is funded through federal government programs i am not responsible for that company i think there is some confusion about what my department is responsible for
we are mostly looking after things like computers and telephones for the government departments
so the question the minister is asking is more to do with a private corporation and i think that they re the only people who can answer his question
thank you
speaker
thank you ms thompson
oral question mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation thank you mr speaker
yes i understand now
so nunavut government is not involved whatsoever with ibc
we can t do anything about what a corporation does
speaker
thank you mr puqiqnak minister responsible for public works telecommunications & technical services ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we can give support as a government and if a community feels neglected by a private company we can give them a letter of support specifically
what i am saying is that as the minister of public works telecommunications & technical services we are not an agency that funds these organizations and those programs are through the federal government
however we can provide a letter of support to say that they should be attending the communities that the member was talking about
thank you
speaker
thank you ms thompson
oral questions mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation thank you mr speaker
thank you to the minister for answering my question
for that reason the ibc i think that we should be providing support to them because they are providing an important duty in the north in the area of communications
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak minister responsible for public works telecommunications & technical services ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i think that the department of culture language elders & youth his department is more responsible for programs such as ibc
ibc are headquartered in iqaluit
perhaps if the member wanted to meet with members of ibc he can arrange that outside of this meeting because this is completely outside of my portfolio
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
last question mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation thank you mr speaker

status on doctor for igloolik
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yesterday i heard on the news and this morning i didn t hear any more information about the health boards

oral questions mr iqaqrialu
question 196 - 1 2
gravel pads rather than piles
mr iqaqrialu interpretation thank you mr speaker
this is directed to the minister of community government housing & transportation
ever since the gravel pads were stopped and all the building foundations are now built on piles i think the houses depreciate much quicker than they used to
i would like to see gravel pads being built where the houses are being built
i wonder if that is going to be put back in place
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu minister responsible for community government housing & transportation mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
at the time we had gravel pads when houses were first being built in the north and when i was living in repulse bay at the time we wanted to know exactly what was happening
i don t know why now that the government and all the communities are using piles now maybe it is cheaper but i think i need to survey all the hamlet councils to find out what their preference is
yes we will be asking the communities what their preferences are for building pads whether they should be using gravel pads or piles
we ll look into that and i am sure that all the members are concerned about that
i will get back to you on that

question 200 - 1 2
national child benefit
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is directed to the minister responsible for health and social services
mr speaker yesterday i raised a concern of the high cost of food in nunavut especially for people on social assistance
mr speaker i wonder if the minister could speak briefly about the national child benefit and the impact this will have on low income families
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for health and social services
mr picco hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the federal provincial and territorial governments have joined together to provide a co-ordinated approach to reducing the level of child poverty in canada
the initiative that the member is talking about is called a national children s benefit
425 million in july of 1999 and indeed again in july 1st 2000 another 425 million
now this benefit provides direct income assistance payments to low income families with children
the benefit amount is based on previous tax returns and the number of children in the family
this indeed mr speaker is good news for nunavut in that we re looking at about 860 thousand that will be provided to low income families in nunavut as a result of nunavut sharing in the national child benefit
thank you mr speaker

>>committee recessed at 12 00 and resumed at 1 30 pm
chairperson interpretation
lets start again
we will now ask the premier to present the budget for his department
mr okalik
budget presentation 1999/2000 for the department of executive
hon paul okalik interpretation
iksivautuq today we are considering the budget of the department of executive and intergovernmental affairs eia
the total budget for the department is $7 734m
eia is one of the smallest departments
it has no capital funds and one grant or contribution
it has a total of 51 employees
employees work as executive assistants or executive secretaries to the 7 ministers
4 employees work in the office of the premier
they are the executive secretary the executive assistant the press secretary and the principal secretary
1 employee works as the executive secretary to the commissioner of nunavut
these 19 people are all considered to be political appointments
they are hired directly by the individual ministers the premier or the commissioner and work directly for them
the head of this department has two titles
she is the deputy minister of executive and intergovernmental affairs and she is the secretary to cabinet 5 people work in the directorate to support these functions
they are the deputy minister one cabinet registrar one finance manager one office manager and one interpreter/translator
they organize and manage the work and the finances of the department
8 people work in the policy function
they include the assistant deputy minister one director three policy advisors two trainees and one support staff
they provide centralized policy development for all departments and generally analyze policy recommendations coming to cabinet
4 people work in communications
their job is to communicate government initiatives to the public to deal with questions and issues from others and to look after protocol with visitors
7 people work in statistics and evaluations
they collect the numbers and information the government needs to understand and plan what is needed in nunavut
they include auditors to check money and how it is spent and program specialists to assess how programs are operating
8 people work in intergovernmental affairs 3 of these people work in our ottawa office
they support elected officials and departments when they go to ottawa
they attend meetings for the government of nunavut and save us money when we don t need to pay airfares 5 people work in iqaluit
they assist in our relationships with other governments at first ministers conferences and with our relationship with nti and our obligations as a government under the land claim
they are responsible for monitoring our agreements with the gnwt
there is a $100 000 budget the commissioner s office that will cover the costs of staff and basic o&m expenses
office accommodation expenses are captured in the pwtts budget and other commissioner s costs will be paid directly by the government of canada
the budget for the nunavut cabinet includes minister s salaries offices and support staff
each minister is also provided a budget to cover ministerial travel and other expenses
with the help of the department of finance and administration these budget numbers were put together despite the fact that we had nothing to compare with but the gnwt s historical numbers
like other department s we are using common o&m assumptions which may change in next year s budget process
for example each trip in nunavut is costed at $3 000 per trip
training per staff person is estimated at $1 000 per employee
and telephone costs are estimated at $2 000 per employee
the point is these numbers are the best estimates for this year but our estimates next year will be even better as we will have something to compare to
on the political side 19 of 19 positions are filled as each minister s office is fully supported
on the cabinet and department side 17 of 32 positions are filled which is 53%
inuit employees represent 47% of the iqaluit positions
iksivautuq i will now conclude by stating that the department of executive and intergovernmental affairs has made a lot of progress in meeting its broad mandate
the budget appropriation requested in the main estimates will enable the department to meet its objectives in 99/2000

department of executive and intergovernmental affairs
premier okalik appeared before the committee on the afternoon of april 29
the main estimates summary provided to the committee indicated total 1999-2000 expenditures of $7 734 000 dollars
the committee recognizes the unique nature of the department
as opposed to a line department which delivers services directly to the public eia is the government s lead central agency in providing support to cabinet policy co-ordination and amplification of political direction
the committee has the following general comments and recommendations
premier s travel and relations with other jurisdictions
the committee was pleased to receive a briefing on the premier s recent trip to ontario
the committee was also pleased to learn of the premier s efforts to save public money wherever possible during official travel
the committee expressed its view that nunavut can learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions where indigenous peoples have achieved the means of guiding their destiny
such issues as community justice corrections and liquor distribution were suggested as being especially worthy of comparison
with respect to federal-nunavut relations the committee was supportive of the premier s efforts to identify additional resources wherever possible during discussions with federal ministers
while recognizing the challenges in this area the committee encourages the premier to make every effort to ensure that nunavut s voice is heard clearly in appropriate intergovernmental forums
the premier was asked to update the committee with respect to the situation concerning disputed islands in hudson bay
he advised the committee that the department was fully aware of the issue and that efforts were underway to secure sufficient resources to defend nunavut s interests in any court action
the premier advised the committee that as a result of an agreement between the federal government the gnwt and the oic the government of nunavut is responsible for any deficit incurred by the oic prior to 1 april 1999
the committee shared the premier s dissatisfaction with this situation and is supportive of any efforts that can be made to resolve it
appointments to boards and agencies
during discussions with the committee the premier stated his desire for an open approach to the issue
he stressed the need for more women to be appointed to such nunavut bodies
the committee emphasized its view that the appointments process should involve regular members of the assembly
relations between cabinet and regular members
the committee noted in its review of the draft business plan that the department has responsibility for ensuring clear and effective dialogue between cabinet and mla s
the committee emphasized its desire to play an active involved role in the decision-making process

general comments to the department of executive and intergovernmental affairs
the floor is now open for general comments
are there any general comments
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman just kind of a comment and a question
in a number of the reports that the committee has heard over the past couple of weeks there have been a lot of referral back to statistical information
it is a vital function mr chairman because that is how all the funding basically is applied throughout nunavut and to nunavut from the federal government
mr chairman i am just wondering if the department has someone in that capacity and are they looking at a plan to update the statistics to reflect the current and most up to date numbers
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr premier
hon paul okalik
thank you mr chairman someone as chief statistician and that s being worked on now
that and the numbers for operations and as well our expenditures
so we have a numbers person on our payroll now
we have also been attending meetings with statistics canada getting their assistance with statistics in our new territory
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you premier okalik
i don t have anybody who would like to make general comments
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman just a brief comment or inquiry regarding the power corporation
we don t seem to have a clear cut understanding as to where it fits into the overall picture
i understand that in discussions last week that it may be tied in as a part of your department intergovernmental affairs
i wonder if you could speak to this so we could get an understanding as to where it fits in the overall picture and what authority or linkage we have with the power corp in hay river
thank you
chairperson
thank you mr o brien
premier okalik
hon paul okalik
thank you
i am not the minister responsible for the public utilities board but i will refer the question to laura gauthier who has been involved for some time on the ntpc file
okay if you don t mind
chairperson interpretation
thank you premier ms gauthier
ms gauthier
thank you mr chairman
in response to mr o brien s question
certainly in support of the minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco we from the executive have been playing very much of a support role for mr picco as the second minister responsible for the power corporation
his roles and responsibilities in respect of the transition agreement which has been a document that is allowing for us to look at a continued power corporation for the next two years
we can certainly make that available to the members we could make a copy of that
there is also legislation that has been grandfathered and it will support that ongoing relation for the power corporation for the two territories
as a sort of sub-body of that is the corporate relations group
they re involved at the officials level to look at specific issues for the delivery of power inside of nunavut
chairperson interpretation
thank you ms gauthier
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i know that you have indicated that mr picco is the lead minister
my question would be what actual authority does this government have in reference to the operations and maintenance of this particular utility
is it not a fact that it is pretty much run controlled and operated by the authorities in hay river
basically we are deferring to the gnwt and their leave it at that
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
ms gauthier
ms gauthier
thank you mr chairman
with respect to the transition agreement between the nwt and nunavut
there are as part of the negotiation process leading up to that transition agreement there was an understanding that the operations of the power corporation would remain sort of the status quo
where there are specific or major initiatives they ll consult with the minister responsible on various issues and the transition agreement very much spells out what some of those areas of consultation and co-management would be
chairperson interpretation
thank you ms gauthier
i am sorry if i mispronounce your name
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i recently saw some correspondence from the hay river office the president of the utility there to mary king of arviat regarding some concerns they had
i don t believe that the hamlet itself is overly pleased with the response they received i know i wasn t when i read it
it seemed very direct and abrupt to be kind about it
in a situation like this what recourse do we have as a government your department or mr picco s to deal with difficulties or differences we may have in the running of the power corporation
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
premier okalik
hon paul okalik
thank you mr chairman
i am somewhat uncomfortable here as the minister is right there responsible for ntpc and i am responsible for a different part of the process but what governs right now is the transition agreement
it is in effect
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr o brien perhaps you could have a meeting or ask questions of the minister regarding ntpc don t forget we are limited to ten minutes on one subject
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
i will be brief in my following comments
i felt that maybe the control and the authority the responsibility lay rather in your department
that was why i was forwarding questions to yourself
i can wait and speak in more detail during the regular session thank you
chairperson interpretation
i don t think this is a question
i don t think it can be directly responded to but if you wish you may respond mr okalik
i am sorry i don t have anybody who wishes to speak to the opening remarks
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman my question is to the premier
the deputy minister and your assistant deputy ministers are usually inuit well the assistants are usually inuit
i am not criticizing your deputy ministers but your inuit staff seem to be assistant deputy ministers
do you have a training program whereby the assistant deputy ministers will be given the opportunity to train and get their qualification as deputy ministers
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr okalik
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
as i indicated earlier today we have designated 1 thousand dollars per staff member so our staff who want to take advantage of further training can do so
we are not sure however what kind of training plan we are going to be implementing but we want to have inuit staff members in all departments and our goal is to train inuit as much as possible
we also need to have fully qualified staff members and we have to keep that in mind but our goal is to have more inuit as staff members but must look at their qualifications as well
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
i don t think you clarified too much about this 1 thousand dollars
maybe you could give us a more detailed explanation about what this 1 thousand dollars is for
clarify for us please
thank you
hon paul okalik interpretation
yes when i was making my presentation i think this was included for all staff that there is 1 thousand dollars set aside for each employee for this coming year
if they wish to take courses or get further training for the coming year
i hope this clarifies it mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you premier okalik
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
just one more question mr chairman back on may 14th i asked the premier for some clarification in regards to the memorandum of understanding that the government is working on with nunavut tunngavik
mr chairman at that time the premier indicated that he did not want to hold up the process as a result of waiting for it to go back to the standing committee
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
thank you mr tootoo
premier okalik
hon paul okalik
thank you mr chairman
from what i have been advised we have a very rough draft from nti so far
it requires a considerable amount of work to work out the details and our first priority has been the sitting and we just received the draft just a few days ago
okay
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
if that could be a possibility thank you mr chairman

hon paul okalik
mr chairman i can make staff available to committee members on the progress of our discussions with nti at this time
okay
chairperson interpretation
thank you premier
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
but a briefing of some kind prior to the finalization of the agreement would be greatly appreciated
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
if you want to respond to that mr premier you may do so
i don t think it is a question but you may respond if you wish
thank you
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the residents of nunavut and looking at the future i know that the population is going to grow
it is going to get more expensive to service the people of nunavut
the funding that we receive from the federal government 580 million and 620 million which we have received is not going to be enough in the future if the funds from the federal government do not change
i was wondering if this funding has criteria
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes the agreement is for two or three years but according to the increase of population we have already appointed a statistician in our office and some of it has been contracted back to the gnwt
also statistics canada will be assisting us
we will do the surveys as the population grows and we will have to utilize the statistics again in order to get more funding from the federal government in the future
chairperson interpretation
thank you premier
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
do i understand that the 620 million and the 580 million will only be used for three years and that agreement is for only three years
do i understand that correctly
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
yes thank you
the agreement is for five years but we can reopen it again after three years is over
some of the funds include population growth
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you premier
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
thank you for the clarification but at this point 99/2000 fiscal year the funding we have for this fiscal year is already not adequate or enough
i was wondering if you department will be seeking additional new funds if we don t have enough
i wish your department would go look for more funds
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr premier okalik
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i apologize it is only after two years not three years that we can reopen this agreement
we will continue to seek additional funds from wherever we can find them
we will be open to all these options whether it be housing the housing minister is already meeting with the federal government officials to attempt to obtain additional funds
so we are looking in all aspects of how and where we can find additional funding
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
for your appropriate answer i don t know what this is going to mean but nunavut tunngavik inc and the nunavut government
since the nunavut government has been established i don t know what the role of to be of nti
is nti still going to be established to carry out the nunavut land claims agreement as we have heard we will be receiving royalties from the mining companies and nti will also be receiving royalties from them
with all these things in mind i think we need to have a clear understanding with that entity as to how the working relationship is going to be
we have to set the working relationship because both nti and the gn represent the nunavut residents
does the nti have the same jurisdiction as the nunavut government
i would like to get all of this cleared up
so my question is what is happening with that situation
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
as i have stated earlier we are now in the process of negotiating or we are working together to sign an mou with nti as to how our relationship is going to be
as gn we represent all of nunavut residents not just the beneficiaries of nunavut
we represent the public of nunavut but nti represents solely the beneficiaries of the land claims agreement
we have to abide by the agreements especially the wildlife article and article 23 to hire more inuit and to work on contracts as per article 24
we will have to abide by the nunavut land claims agreement even though we are nunavut government
at this time i cannot tell you what kind of working relationship there is going to be in the future
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier

thank you mr chairman
i have a question in regards to the nunavut final agreement
it seems that this is the first time that the nunavut legislative assembly is having it s session and here it is saying nunavut final agreement
could you clarify that for me
thank you
chairperson
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
it should say nunavut land claims final agreement
everything in there is in the nunavut land claims agreement
since we have to abide by the agreement the federal government gives us money for implementing the nunavut final agreement
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i understand your clarification but the translation i think require amending
it needs to be more clear because i don t want this to be our last session
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
yes the translation is a literal translation of english
it should talk about the nunavut final agreement
which nti gn and the federal government are responsible for
this agreement was ratified in 1993 and we will get funds to implement it
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier we shall continue
page 2 - 11 details of grants and contributions
information item
do you agree
some members
agreed
chairperson interpretation
going back to 2 - 3 detail of expenditures operations & maintenance total 7 million 734 thousand
some members
agreed
chairperson
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
where are you mr chairman i thought you were on page 2 - 11 and i had a question on that page
it talks about the official languages commissioner and the same amount on 2 - 11
perhaps there is a mistranslation could you clarify that for me
is it okay to go back to 2 - 11
some members
agreed
chairperson interpretation 2 - 11 mr okalik
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the first one is for leadership forums
this goes along that line and is allotted to the communities
we will be giving this to the department of community government housing & transportation because this is geared more towards the communities to prepare and plan for meetings
second one circumpolar conference
the gnwt was also allotting some funds to the inuit circumpolar conference to give them support
it is mainly for the inuit circumpolar conference
are you clear now
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr okalik
the english and the inuktitut aren t the same even though they are on the same page
the inuktitut version is totally different
as i have stated the inuktitut version is mr havioyak s department
the heading on page 2 - 11 in syllabics states that it is for culture language elders & youth and they both have 1 million dollars
i think that the inuktitut has a wrong page in there and perhaps if they were the same do we get 2 million dollars
i would like to get clarification on this because the english and the inuktitut aren t the same
perhaps to get good direction we will take a short break so that we will get clarity on this
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
the english and the syllabics are totally different 1 1 million dollars and english is 240 thousand
we have to rectify this situation now by perhaps taking a short break because the english and the inuktitut don t correlate
chairperson interpretation we will take a ten minute break to correct this
>>committee recessed at 2 38 pm
>>committee resumed at 2 58 pm
chairperson interpretation
these are informational items the translations were corrected
these are just informational items under 2 - 11 details of grants and contributions
are you in agreement under 2 - 3 detail of expenditures total operations & maintenance 7 million 734 thousand
some members
agreed
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
getting back to the correction that needed to be changed earlier is that a different number now or is it just the same as the english
chairperson interpretation
mr premier can you clarify
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes the english version was 240 thousand and 7 million 734 thousand is corrected the inuktitut is corrected but the english version remains the same
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you for making that clear
let s go back to total operations & maintenance 7 million 734 thousand

throne speech
commissioner maksagak
please be seated
elders mr speaker speakers and clerks from chambers across canada senator sivuliuqti maligaliuqtiit and honoured guests
i am pleased to welcome you to the opening of the third session of the first legislative assembly of nunavut
our government has been in existence for just over 200 days
in that time much has been accomplished
staffing has increased government departments are now staffed at 53% of strength
ministers have taken up their assigned portfolios and members their roles
the transition of existing programs has been astoundingly smooth and credit must be given for the hard work required to make this happen
the transition to government in nunavut has been a success but there is much left to do to make this a government of and for nunavut
this has not been done in isolation
it has been done with the help and inspiration of the people of the diverse nunavut communities who have hosted this government over the past six months
the origins of the document are in the first cabinet retreat at kimmirut in april of this year
our mandate was still fresh and new and there was still snow on the ground families were leaving by snowmobile for spring hunting on the sea ice during the three sunny days that cabinet spent in kimmirut
it was so sunny and hot that the children of baker lake were down swimming in the strip of open water between the sand and the flow edge
the hospitality of the people of baker lake was also warm
members held their sessions outside on a high point of land on the road to prince river
the sun and wind were strong and the land was showing its colours but still without insects
people from the community stopped by with dry meat and kettles of tea after baker lake a revised document was circulated to members and their comments received an intensive review by cabinet in august at bathurst inlet
this document has been given the name the bathurst mandate with thanks for the support and inspiration received from this small fiercely independent community in the central arctic
during the four days of the cabinet retreat the colours of the land were beginning to turn the char were running and the berries were waiting to be picked it was a perfect location to look to nunavut s future
the community s spirit of independence and the beauty of the land there guided the decisions made
the final drafts of the mandate were reviewed with many of our partners in government including the nunavut association of municipalities nunavut tunngavik inc and other representative groups
this bathurst mandate has truly been developed in the spirit of consensus
it is a demonstration of the unity of spirit in nunavut that so many elements could be drawn together in a comprehensive and realistic statement of goals and dreams
the vision the document presents of nunavut is based on four main premises
inuuqatigiittiarniq - the healthy inter-connection of mind body and spirit pijarnirniqaqsat katujjiqatigiinnirlu - simplicity and unity
namminiq makitajunnarniq - self-reliance and ilippallianginnarniq - continuing learning
inuuqatigiittiarniq
in our government people will always come first
our government s visions is that in the year 2 thousand 20 nunavut will be a place where self assured caring communities will respond to the needs of individuals and families
over the coming months our government will open a public dialogue on housing issues at the same time as developing practical steps to address the need for social housing
in consultation with the members of this assembly a housing task force has been established to advise the minister responsible on the development and implementation of immediate and long term plans to respond to the housing needs of nunavummiut
housing is one of our government s two major priorities our government will also work with communities to create a capacity plan to build administrative strength and diversity in each community
pijarnirniqsat katujjiqatigiinnirlu our government believes that simplicity in the processes of government encourages access makes tasks more focused and more achievable and invites participation by all nunavummiut
our government will be looking to all members in this assembly to help ensure that the actions of all government departments and agencies meet our commitment to simplicity and unity
our government is committed to making the received laws of nunavut reflect the values of nunavummiut with the advice and counsel of our elders and communities we will achieve this goal during our government s mandate
our government will continue to demonstrate and act upon the commitment to the full implementation of the nunavut land claim agreement acknowledging the origins of nunavut through article 4 of that agreement
our government is also committed to working with the nunavut business community to simplify and enhance access to business development and support programs and to build local employment
it is important that the financial decisions to be made for nunavut are also arrived at in this same spirit of consensus
to gain from the knowledge of our people the government will consult with mla s community leaders and the people of nunavut in identifying budget priorities
during the month of november teams of mla s and ministers will visit communities to hold pre-budget consultations
these public meetings will give people an opportunity to learn about nunavut s finances and give the government valuable input as the budget is developed
a vision for nunavut elders ladies and gentlemen and honoured guests our vision of nunavut is far reaching but it is also achievable
i am confident of this because we all know that 20 years ago nunavut itself was a dream which some called impossible
commitment hard work and an unrelenting focus on our goals have brought us here today sitting in the new legislative assembly building for nunavut planning for our own future
the full text of the bathurst mandate which i have highlighted some aspects of will be tabled by the premier during this legislative session
during this session our government will be introducing a supplementary appropriations act and the loan authorization act as well there are three bills to amend
i recommend timely passage of each of the bills being brought before this assembly
i now declare open the third session of the first nunavut legislative assembly
with that i would like to invite you to join myself and the speaker and members of this assembly in the foyer for refreshments before the resumption of the order paper
qujannamiik
>>applause
>>short recess
speaker interpretation
at this time i would like to welcome the members of the legislative assembly and also our visitors the elders to the third session of the first legislative assembly
it is my honour to make some comments
on april 1 the commissioner gave us this bible and it will have a place here in these chambers
this bible will help us guide our deliberations into the future and to have good debates at the house because of course some of the things that we are going to be doing are going to be quite challenging

this document has been six months in the making and i am pleased to describe to members and visitors to this house the development of the mandate and how we plan to move from vision to action
this document began in kimmirut during the first cabinet retreat
it was discussed with members of this assembly during standing committee presentations in may and the long term vision part of nunavut was made part of our work at the baker lake caucus retreat in june
a revised version clarified by the baker lake discussions was distributed to mlas in july and their comments solicited
cabinet did a detailed review of the text and principles on which it is based
in september the document was revised in bathurst inlet by cabinet and the text was sent to every mla in their home community
in addition the appropriate portions were discussed with nunavut tunngavik inc and the association of municipalities
the vision and priorities truly reflect the consensus nature of this government i also believe that it truly reflects the beliefs goals and wishes of the people of nunavut in all parts of our territory
the document is separated into four sections inuuqatigiittiarniq - healthy communities pijarnirnirqsat katujjiqatiriittiarnirlu - simplify and unify and also namminiq makitajunarniq - self-reliance and ilippallianginnarniq - learning
the actions we have identified are sometimes specific and sometimes general
they are designed to provide direction to our departments to help them find the priorities in their work and develop a long-term vision in everything we do
year by year we will develop these goals and build on our successes supporting and prodding as required
mr speaker the path that we have set for ourselves is a challenging one but it is one that we have all chosen
i am confident that in the footprints of the founders of nunavut as we work together we can achieve the goals that we have set for ourselves

appointment of chief coroner
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
thank you mr speaker
i would like to inform members and the people of nunavut that we have recently appointed elizabeth copeland of whale cove as chief coroner
ms copeland was selected through a competitive process
one of ms copeland s strongest attributes is her community background and her experience as a community coroner a fact that will serve her well in her new position
this is an important function and for the first time it is being filled by an inuk
as well in keeping with the principles of inuit qaujimajatuqangit ms copeland will continue to operate out of her home community
one of her important tasks will be to give support through training and advice to others working in the field
we are planning to hire an administrative coroner in the near future
this person will work together with our chief coroner ms copeland
ms copeland deserves the congratulations of this legislature in her appointment as chief coroner for nunavut
thank you

hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today to inform members of our progress to date in housing issues
as you all know i recently established a ministerial task force on housing
the lack of access to a range of affordable housing is causing many health and social problems due to overcrowding issues
interpretation ends the creation of a strategy to address this issue will be through the task force on housing
this task force consists of four mlas and three housing experts from across nunavut
the task force role will be central in making recommendations to me to find a lasting solution to the housing problem in nunavut
mr speaker i have given the task force the freedom to decide for itself the specific housing issues it will address and discuss but the task force will issue reports to me
the first report which i expect on december 1st will assist in deciding how and where public housing units will be built this summer
interpretation ends the task force will be consulting with all members of the legislative assembly members of the public community representatives and others

nunavut s electrical energy strategy
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
i rise today to update this assembly on the activities i have initiated under my portfolio for the northwest territories power corporation in nunavut
since april a tremendous amount of time and effort has been dedicated to assessing nunavut s electrical energy situation
this is because our government and the government of the nwt have only six months left mr speaker to make a serious decision about the joint supply and delivery of power to nunavummiut
this time limit is set out in the transition agreement that was signed between the gnwt and the office of the interim commissioner before division
the agreement states that if there is no agreement on the future operation of ntpc by march 31st 2000 then ntpc will be divided between the two territories
ntpc operations would continue for one more year mr speaker until march 31st 2001 to allow the nunavut power corporation to become operational
mr speaker it is my responsibility to ensure that we fully address nunavut s options for the supply and delivery of power
this government must make informed decisions about what course nunavut should take to meet our electrical power needs after march 31 2001
to do that we need to fully research and analyze information related to the power corporation and its operations and costs as well as the needs of our communities
to accomplish this goal i assembled a special team this summer called the ikuma working group
their tasks were to identify analyze and develop options for safe reliable and cost efficient power supply and delivery in nunavut
mr speaker they have worked extremely hard and i am pleased to tell you that they will be presenting me with their findings and recommendations at the end of this month
mr speaker as you know we also recently issued a request for expressions of interest to seven utility companies from across canada
there were two reasons for this first to assist the ikuma group in determining the full costs of potential options by soliciting and negotiating bids with utility companies for headquarter type services
second to begin the search for a potential supplier of these types of services for nunavut in case mr speaker in case we decide to pursue a separate nunavut power corporation
i want to ensure that nunavummiut are well informed of our activities and of this government s commitment to ensure safe and reliable power
therefore i am launching an information campaign for the public in the very near future

problems with project surname and census
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to make some comments in the 1970 s the government of the nwt signed an agreement to do a census
our names were put in there and were recognized with our last names especially by revenue canada
but the way our last names were written they were misspelled also the birth dates are wrong in project surname
mr speaker naming people is very important in any way of life
the writing of names should be done properly our ancestors had names with meanings
when a loved one dies they name their children after them so they can remain close to the memory of their loved ones
for that reason mr speaker in the beginning of our government we should correct this situation and have the proper surnames written down and that is what i would like to see
i will use myself as an example mr speaker
my name is misspelled my mom had named me puqiqnak puqik meaning the back leg of a caribou
when project surname was there my name was changed to pokirk and that work doesn t mean anything
so it puts me down as an inuk person because my name is misspelled
mr speaker our names have meaning and they have to be written down properly i rise today so that our names can be spelled correctly in nunavut and so that the birth dates can be corrected
an example of the problems with the census i have a sister who is older than i am by two years but in our birth dates it says that we have the same birth date on the same year

this house is decorated by nunavut arts and crafts and it reflects nunavut
mr speaker i am very appreciative and proud of all the gifts that we have received from the other canadian jurisdictions and provinces
but the gift from the federal government the map i must say that the decorative map does not reflect all of nunavut
for example the ungava bay hudson bay islands are not included in that gift
sanikiluaq is not included in that gift mr speaker so i would like this to be rectified sometime very soon in the near future

this house is a bit small we know when we say that this assembly belongs to nunavut residents iqaluit residents inuit not all of them can come into the gallery because it gets filled to its capacity right away
we want the public to be aware that we would like to welcome each and every one of the people from nunavut
we should be able to welcome any inuit people or any nunavut residents to come and view the proceedings of the house

irene avaalaqiaq receives honorary doctorate
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
the attentiveness of a young woman to the stories her grandmother told her of the ways of her people led to a historic moment this march
that s when the senate of ontario s university of guelph announced baker lake s irene avaalaqiaq has become the first aboriginal canadian to be awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree from that university
>>applause
avaalaqiaq was awarded the degree in recognition of the outstanding contribution that she has made to the development of inuit art and the leadership role that she has played through her work in wall hangings drawings and sculptures
born at princess mary lake in 1940 she has lived in baker lake ever since
she started creating her art in 1969 when she decided she wanted to do something to preserve her grandmother anashujuaq s tales of how inuit life used to be
this honorary degree will be presented this week to avaalaqiaq and i would like to take this time with my colleagues to congratulate her and remember this is a very proud moment for nunavut

i would like to echo the speakers comments of yesterday and acknowledge and salute the tremendous skill and dedication of those artists and individuals who have made this place the thing of beauty that it is
this is the people s house
it is the arena in which the issues affecting nunavut are discussed
and the forum for the elected representatives of nunavummiut to stand up in support of the concerns and aspirations of the constituents we serve
i encourage all residents of iqaluit to take the opportunity to observe the proceedings of this house from the gallery
it was good to listen to commissioner maksagak s speech from the throne yesterday
the speech was a clear articulation of the priorities and challenges that face this government
mr speaker i do not believe that i am alone when i say that it is now time to get down to the hard work that will make the vision a reality
we are in our new house
the appropriate ceremonies have concluded
ministers and members are familiar with their portfolios and roles
the senior management of the bureaucracy is in place
we have held our priority-setting retreats and reached a broad consensus on where we want to go
the political direction to departments is clear and now it is time to start delivering
to expect immediate solutions to every challenge is not realistic
mr speaker i look forward throughout this session of the legislative assembly to speak out on the issues that my constituents have raised

we had motor breakdowns a few times and i think that we have to thank a lot of people
first i would like to thank a person from repulse bay george qaviuputulik i would like to extend my gratitude to that person in repulse bay and from coral harbour we also received help from cape dorset
i apologize if i don t say their surnames
timoon toonoo who is the sao from the hamlet and also qimmiata nungusuitok who towed our boat and the cape dorset search and rescue team that we would like to say thank you to

nunavut capital commission
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker during the recent elections one of my promises was to commission a study to examine the pros and cons of a nunavut capital commission
mr speaker i have forwarded copies of the report to the mayor and council of iqaluit as well as to member tootoo and premier paul okalik
an advance copy was also provided to the minister for community government the honourable jack anawak
this was a report commissioned for me as the mla for iqaluit east and mr speaker it has not been formally endorsed by the nunavut government
most provincial territorial and international capitals have a capital commission in place to help the locally elected body deal with development and planning issues
the nunavut capital commission would function in a parallel fashion to these other similar commissions but would also be flexible to deal with the different aspects of a northern capital
it would also have representatives mr speaker from other nunavut communities appointed as commissioners
the designation of iqaluit as capital of nunavut is a result of a vigorous territorial campaign and plebiscite in 1995
as part of that team i travelled with local residents mr gordon rennie leah inutiq and jerry ell to rankin and arviat promoting iqaluit as our capital and as our campaign slogan said iqaluit for all of nunavut
the capital commission report if adopted would follow up on that commitment and that promise
mr speaker some of the exciting recommendations of the report include a proposal to set aside a reserve of 200 acres of land for the future legislative assembly and a possible museum site
this follows along with the seat of government in the west where yellowknife has designated the area near frame lake as the capital site
it contains walking trails benches open spaces and interpretative displays
the two hundred acre proposed iqaluit reserve runs parallel to the apex road and takes in the historic apex beach area and the old hbc buildings
mr speaker i think that the capital commission report is proactive and it is an idea whose time has come
i now await the recommendations of the iqaluit town council on their review of this report
later today i will table the report in this house so that it will be made available to the public in both english and inuktitut

like we have done in other communities in nunavut
in some cases for example when we have a shortage of nurses what we try to do is identify what nursing positions are needed in the community
in some cases it may be a psychiatric nurse as opposed to a general practitioner per se
those types of proactive solutions can be found at the community level
so if a specific request comes forward then we can look at it

mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i remember many many times my colleagues speaking of the need for suicide prevention and professionals in the field to help guide individuals that are troubled
so this isn t new this is an old story
i find it difficult to believe that the minister is not aware that each community should have a mental health specialist
this is not a new topic it s been around for a long time
i think that the minister should make it his business to find out whether each community has a mental health worker
thank you mr speaker

thank you mr o brien
minister of health and social services mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i should be very clear here that the role as a minister of health and social services is to look at all aspects of health at the community and at the territorial level
and i take the role very responsibly and seriously and i don t like the indication that i m not taking it seriously
i gave the example where in another community there was a request for a nurse
it wasn t just a request for a nurse we put in a psychiatric nurse
but we ve got to find those professionals

question 07 - 1 3
task force on housing issues
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is for the minister responsible for housing
in her minister s statement she indicated that she s formed a task force which i think is good
we need to develop a task force and she indicated that the mandate of the task force was to find solutions to the housing problems in nunavut
one concern i have that she made in her statement however was the fact that she was expecting the task force to provide her with information on where and what kind of public housing would be built
my question to the minister is does the department not have that information available at this time
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister responsible for housing ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
qujannamiik uqaqti
interpretation i would also like to thank the member for iqaluit centre as he s one of the members who will be sitting on the task force on housing
i m pleased to make that announcement
i believe we all know this and i also made statements on radio and tv
the numbers that were given to us are not quite accurate in regards to the number of people that are on the waiting list
there are a lot of people out there who took their names out and therefore we don t have a true representation of the people who are on the waiting list for housing
there s an overcrowding situation there are three or four nuclear families living under one roof and there are some young people who are still living with their parents
so they should qualify to live in their own housing
we have to create a task force and i would like to have a close working relationship with them and also members and housing staff to find some solutions
they re compiling new numbers that are more reflective of the real housing shortage out there
there are 26 communities in the nunavut area and i believe that we have to treat every one equal
we can t know exactly where these houses are going to be built with numbers that aren t accurate
thank you
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
mr tootoo

thank you mr tootoo

speaker
thank you ms thompson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the old numbers that were used that weren t accurate i believe were from the 1996 needs survey
i d like to ask the minister why it s taken this long in order for new information to be sought i think like she indicated in her statement that these aren t new issues
i d just like to ask the minister why some of these things weren t addressed earlier on instead of waiting until now to be looked at

second supplementary mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you again mr speaker
mr speaker we ve talked about the needs and the critical situation we have with housing
would the minister be able to commit that if there is a surplus i know this may come across as hypothetical but we re assuming that there is
will some of these funds be put towards the housing crisis
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it isn t hypothetical we know there are some unexpended funds within the departments and government as a whole
i can t commit to anything right now
it has to go out to the financial management board any recommendations on wherever excess funds would be expended
i think one has to recognize that we have some issues to deal with
specifically the health board situation and their financial status as that stands now
there are some over expenditures in the information technology work that s being undertaken by this government
we have the collective agreement process under way right now with federation of nunavut teachers that may have some financial implications
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister of finance mr ng

mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i ll take my question a step further
i realize that there may be some unexpected expenditures that we re aware of now and the minister alluded to
having said that once these commitments are made are looked after would it be fair to say that if housing is the number 1 priority that what is left over would go toward the housing problem

mr mclean
question 12 - 1 3
day-care funding
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
mr speaker over the last several months quite a few day cares in our region have been experiencing financial difficulty
the government of nunavut has earmarked 1 4 million for day care for all of nunavut
there s millions of dollars in third party funding out there that sometimes is very hard for these organizations to access
we all know that day care is a very important issue in nunavut and we have a large number of young kids that attend these day cares
my question to the minister is he going to try and seek an increase in day care funding for nunavut and has he taken any steps to talk to his federal counterparts about it
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
two questions minister responsible for day cares
mr arvaluk oh sorry there are two questions in there and i think there s two departments that are involved here
minister of health and minister of education
mr arvaluk would you like to respond to the question
hon james arvaluk
mr speaker is the question are we talking with our federal counterparts in respect to increasing day-care funding
is that what the question is
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
i will allow you to ask the question again mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
i ll try to rephrase the question i m sorry i confused the minister
yes mr minister are you negotiating any increase from your federal counterparts to increase day care funding for nunavut
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr speaker i think if i add some preamble to this it will be clearer
yes we are already concerned about this and we will be relaying this message to our federal counterparts because it allows the parents to be able to work rather than being on income support
that in turn is a good investment so we will continue to relay that message
but i d like to add to the question that is how and when how fast we ll be able to get that i don t know yet

speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister of finance

thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr ng
your third supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
the minister indicated that there was some confusion over whose responsibility it was to undertake the task to do the functional review of the department
at the time last spring in the last session it was indicated that it was going to be the responsibility of the department of health and social services
and now i guess i m finding out that it s the department of finance that s doing that functional review
i just wanted to ask for some clarification as to what caused that confusion and what finally resulted thank you mr speaker

mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you
the uqsuqtuq development corporation i believe the money comes in from the department of public works and it takes a long time to reach our community
could you give us an update on what s happening
the reason why i m asking this question is it takes a long time for the money to come into the development corporation
ms thompson interpretation
thank you for the clarification
this is in reference to a letter that was written by the member to myself
this is also being dealt with by different departments
we gave this request to the department of finance and asked them why it takes a long time for the money to come in to the communities
i m still waiting for a response from the department of finance and i ll inform the member once i receive that response
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
supplementary question mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
a lot of the communities get contracts from the government and it takes a long time for the money to come in and because of that some of the community companies go through financial stress
i would like to ask the nunavut government to be expedient in sending money to the communities so that the businesses will be more viable
i also know because of the long wait for their money some of their employees are moving onto other jobs because they haven t been paid for a long time
i would like to urge the government departments to be more expedient in sending out money to the communities
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
i don t hear a question but if you would like to make a response ms thompson
ms thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
that was a very clear outline of the concerns in the communities and we hope to see a better smoother operation
i ll work on his responses as soon as i can and i ll inform the member
thank you

more questions mr o brien
question 15 - 1 3
status of the three hospitals
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is to follow up on some questions asked earlier by my colleague in reference to the hospitals the three hospitals that are being planned for nunavut
mr speaker i don t want to throw cold water on this but i need some clarification here
am i to understand that these three hospitals are approved to be constructed
and the question would be to mr ng
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker

thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr ng minister of finance
another question mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker can the minister tell me who is picking up the cost for all this planning and design work
i understand just from an article in the paper yesterday that the design work for these facilities is already completed and there was an article in the newspaper about it
who is actually paying for this
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister of finance mr ng

thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr ng
third supplementary mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
thank you minister for that clarification
the question to the minister would be once this work is completed will it go through and be passed with the standing committee on health for review
the second point the functional review that you are speaking of and the preliminary design will this work come through the standing committee on health so they can review this
and this functional review does it take into account the difficulty in trying to recruit nurses and doctors and specialists to nunavut

more questions
mr o brien
question 17 - 1 3
staffing for medical facilities
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker this is a question that was posed by mr ng for mr picco
my question is directed to the minister of health
i ask that question in relationship to the fact that we have so much difficulty in even recruiting nurses and keeping them and also social services workers
have you been involved with discussions in reference to this particular issue
speaker
thank you mr o brien
before i ask mr picco to respond i would like to advise the members not to mention the names of the ministers
it has to go through the speaker
mr picco minister of health
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker that was a good ruling
mr speaker no we haven t looked at the actual staffing needs because the program functional review hasn t been completed
as mr ng stated earlier the program functional review will look at what programs and services will be delivered out of the buildings
after that is done then you can look at the staffing complement that would suit that building or that piece of infrastructure that we ll have on the ground
so mr speaker i guess the short answer is no we haven t reviewed it because the program functional review hasn t been completed
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
more questions second supplementary mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is again directed to the minister responsible for health
given our past experience in recruiting and maintaining our medical staff does the minister anticipate any problem in trying to recruit staff
for example to operate the proposed new hospital for iqaluit
thank you
speaker

minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco

no other questions
if you would like to ask your final question mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question of course again is for the minister responsible for health
you spoke of the hospital in iqaluit being four or five years down the road assuming that it is approved and funded
what is the timing on the smaller centres that are being proposed the smaller hospitals
and if the minister could address the problem with the recruitment and retention of staff
if these potential hospitals are only a year or so down the road or is that too far into the future for the minister to try and predict
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i heard two questions in there no three was it and i m more than happy to try and answer those questions
suffice it to say mr speaker we can t look at when and where it s hypothetical to say what the problems are going to be if there s going to be a problem two years down the road for recruitment
we don t know what program functional plans will be in place for those facilities indeed the government hasn t yet decided if it s going to move forward and the government hasn t even completed the program functional review
so how can i hypothetically say if it s going to be a problem to staff something that hasn t even been approved or constructed or is even in place
so i tried explaining that
two on recruitment and retention mr speaker i d love to sit here and answer questions on recruitment and retention
the nunavut employee s union is moving towards a collective agreement process with our government now that may address some of the concerns that we have in salaries and salary dollars
if the member would allow later on this afternoon with the full caucus in the briefing on health and social services we could get into more detail on recruitment and retention issues
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
i would like to make another ruling
the second time mr o brien you asked two questions on your final supplementary

overview of health and social services initiatives
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
i appreciated the opportunity to brief the full caucus about some important issues facing the department of health & social services
during this session i want to expand on that briefing by updating you and the house on more of the exciting and sometimes difficult initiatives that are underway in my department
as you know we have been very busy over the past six months implementing the decision to integrate the regional health boards into one department
since april the department has been holding regular integration meetings and conference calls with senior staff from the regional boards
i am pleased to tell you that we are making significant progress which i will explain in more detail in later statements
mr speaker the process of integration has been a large and challenging task for the boards and for the department and i want to commend all the staff for their hard work and commitment to excellence
i also want to reinforce this government s commitment to a no layoff policy for those employees affected by integration
the process of integrating the boards could not have been as productive as it has been if it weren t for the patience ideas and support of the chairs and ceos of the regional boards
with that in mind mr speaker i would like to publicly thank
sharon ehaloak chairperson of the kitikmeot regional health & social services board and their ceo miss alice isnor
rosie oolooyuk chairperson of the keewatin board and ceo keith best
and dennis patterson chairperson of the baffin board and ceo jarvis hoult
mr speaker although the integration of the health boards is a major task unto itself we have also been moving forward on other important issues
with the support of this house we were able to create the first nunavut nursing program at arctic college
this program is being delivered in conjunction with dalhousie university in halifax and is something that our government can be justifiably proud of and a crucial step towards ensuring quality care and a stable workforce in the long term
last week the hon james arvaluk and i were able to meet these students to congratulate them and wish them the very best in their studies
the road ahead for these students is a challenging one
it will take commitment perseverance hard work and probably some sleepless nights
they will need the support of their friends families and communities
but they are a part of our future - they have risen to the challenge and will make nunavut proud
educating our own nurses is just one part of a comprehensive recruitment and retention strategy that we are developing
we are also in the process of hiring a nunavut workforce development officer within the department who will be mainly responsible for working on recruitment and retention issues
it is expected that more recruitment and retention initiatives will be announced over the coming weeks
mr speaker working with the hon kelvin ng who is responsible for p3 projects in nunavut we are moving ahead with the program functional review of the rankin inlet cambridge bay and iqaluit projects
arviat s health centre will begin construction in earnest this spring
i also want to tell you a little about our plans for the future delivery of heath care in nunavut
our goal is to shift the emphasis of programs and policies to community based delivery and preventative care mr speaker preventative care
an approach that goes hand-in-hand with community empowerment
we are also seeking creative ways to improve access to health care and social services in the communities through initiatives such as telehealth
this is a promising tool for nunavut and i would like to thank the members for attending the recent demonstration that i held to show you this technology
i will be telling you more about this initiative later this session
as you can see mr speaker we are working on many initiatives but for us to be successful we need to build our capacity in the communities and to deal with the financial pressures facing us
as publicly announced recently the three health boards had a combined deficit of approximately $8 9 million dollars as of march 31 1999
as a department and as a government we are acutely aware of the implications of this deficit and are moving aggressively to identify the causes and to put in place a strategic plan to deal with it
i want to reassure the people of nunavut that service delivery will not be compromised by these deficits
of course the other ingredient that is essential for success is the input and participation of all residents of nunavut
it is with this in mind that i have visited and met with health centre staff and hamlet councils in many nunavut communities
over the coming months i plan to hold more meetings and to attend regional forums where possible
mr speaker as you can imagine undertaking the initiatives that i have touched upon this morning has been extremely challenging for our dedicated staff
i am very grateful for their hard work and determination

inuit rcmp graduates
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
because i can only say thank you in inuktitut
i am pleased to announce to the legislature that the first all-inuit troop of recruits has completed training in regina
we now have six highly trained inuit rcmp officers who have returned to nunavut and are assigned to various communities throughout the territory
the inuit officers are
joe baines from iqaluit assigned to arviat
pitseolak koochiakjuk from iqaluit assigned to cambridge bay
eric ootoovak from pond inlet assigned to iqaluit kevin sudlovenick from pond inlet assigned to rankin inlet
richard tatty from arviat assigned to iqaluit
ben williams from iqaluit assigned to rankin inlet
this is the first time that we have had a full troop of inuit recruits trained to become officers
this is an extremely important event for our communities and for nunavut as a whole
inuit officers who can speak the inuktitut language and who understand the people will have a major impact on justice in the communities
and hopefully these officers will serve as role models for young people throughout nunavut
i believe that this is inuit qaujimajatuqangit at work
i want to recognize and thank chief superintendent chris bothe of v division for his vision and his efforts in making this initiative a reality
but most important i want to congratulate our new inuit rcmp officers for their courage their hard work and their dedication to the people of nunavut
they will face challenges as they assume their new roles but they will have the support and encouragement of this legislature and the people of nunavut throughout their careers
thank you mr speaker
>>applause

an education act for nunavut
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to make an announcement on an education act for nunavut
mr speaker i am pleased to announce an initiative that will impact on the development of education in nunavut for many years to come
as you remember a decision was made during the last session to dissolve the divisional education councils
this decision means that we must revise the existing education act to reflect the new roles and responsibilities of the various partners involved with the education of our children
it will also allow us the opportunity to revise the act to make it more reflective of nunavut
i am pleased to report that we are receiving comments back from this exercise
the suggestions we receive will allow for further development of an education act for all of nunavut
it is important that those involved in the education of our children take an active role in the revision of the education act
it is through the active involvement of parents dea s community members and educators that we will develop an education system that is meaningful responsive and reflective of nunavut
interpretation mr speaker we will be bringing the revisions of the education act forward at a future time
i will be keeping the members informed as to our progress

sport nunavut division
hon jack anawak
thank you mr speaker
sport nunavut division a division of community government and transportation promotes develops and delivers sport in nunavut
before the creation of nunavut sport was funded and delivered through the independent nwt organization sport north
sport nunavut is now funded through government sources so it became a division of community government and transportation
sport nunavut headquarters is located in baker lake with four staff members a director two sport development officers and one support staff
even though sport and recreation programs are organized and funded through various levels of government the delivery of programs is often at the community level through countless volunteer hours
fourteen sports applied to join sport nunavut and take advantage of our programs and services eleven of these sports are now legally incorporated associations and in some instances have also applied for membership in their related national sport organizations
sport nunavut has three main goals in its first year of operation
the first goal is to have informal sporting groups form territorial sports associations these associations in conjunction with sport nunavut would take responsibility for delivering their individual sport programs with assistance from developmental grants
the second goal is to ensure a level of proficiency for all sport volunteers involved with the delivery of sport programs in nunavut
sport nunavut s coaching/officiating strategy will target the severe lack of certified coaches and officials in nunavut
over the next few months sport nunavut working with the coaching association of canada will host several clinics specifically requested by communities and sport associations
our third goal is to provide the leadership role in the development of a representative team from nunavut at the arctic winter games 2000 in whitehorse
nunavut will have representatives competing in twelve sports
for many of our youth the arctic winter games and the regional and territorial trials leading to the games provide an opportunity to share in sport and spirit
team nunavut will be comprised not only of athletes but also coaches officials volunteers and a cultural delegation
sport nunavut has been fortunate to recruit numerous volunteers who have joined together to help build healthy communities in nunavut
the recruitment training and recognition of these volunteers are an essential component of the sporting community and far too often their contributions are overlooked
as i stand in this house today as the minister responsible for sports i would like to publicly thank these individuals
i would also like to ask my fellow members to recognize the time energy and dedication of these individuals in our communities
i also would like to take this opportunity to welcome the sport nunavut division staff in baker lake patrick tagoona director
tommy bruce and jeffrey seeteenak sport development officers and marianne uqayuittuq divisional secretary

thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today representing the people of pond inlet my constituency i think it was in 1997 that some students went out on a land program in lancaster sound
they were stuck on a floe edge on a piece of ice for three days and i am very pleased to announce that nobody was fatally hurt or harmed
they had to be picked up by a helicopter on an emergency basis

recognition of search and rescue team
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
today i rise to recognize and acknowledge my community s search and rescue team and all the people who take part when we have to search for hunters
when this happens they have to work very hard to try and do their fund raising for search and rescue efforts
some of these search and rescue teams are not even supported financially by the government and they have to do their own fund raising
i know that this is the case in all the communities of nunavut
search and rescue is very important and critical to nunavut
i know that people who are involved in search and rescue teams would like to work on educating people on how to survive from the bottom of their heart
they all work hard night and day regardless of whether there is a blizzard outside they do their searching
therefore i would like to acknowledge all the people who do search and rescue
mr speaker i would like to acknowledge our government for giving financial support when we need this for search and rescue
i will be giving a written document in regards to this issue to the appropriate minister

year of the elder person
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
this morning the members of the legislative assembly had the honour of having a meeting with the elders of nunavut to hear their concerns
uqaqti 1999 is the year of the elder person
traditions and knowledge from the land are rarely passed on now to the younger generation by experience
this in itself has been an impetus for numerous efforts to keep these things alive
in the past august 200 elders from across nunavut and nunavik gathered in iqaluit to share with each other and members of the community traditional songs and dances customs and practices
uqaqti let us not forget that this is the year of the elder and try to listen to them more often

changes to justice system
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this morning i rise for my member s statement in reference to the justice system
the justice system has to be amended for the inuit and nunavut residents lifestyle
other aboriginal groups for example the navajo indians have their own justice system
we have to utilize our traditions and culture within the nunavut justice system
the justice system within nunavut is very important and should reflect our culture

education a priority
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise again today to talk about one of the key issues that the government has identified as a priority and that is education
education is vital to our future
i think this is especially true in the primary and pre-school area
it is during these first crucial years that the skills are developed that will help our young children throughout the rest of their educational lives and employment for the rest of their lives
i think it is very important that these areas are identified and funded adequately
i think our education system has to ensure that we give these young people the tools they need to do the jobs we are going to want them to do in the future
i just wanted to commend the government for making that one of their priorities and i look forward to asking the minister some questions during this session

importance of elders
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i know that we touched upon the issue of elders but we realize that we need more support and we have to consult more with the elders
as they are becoming fewer and fewer we have to use the elders during the initial stages of our nunavut government
the elders are not going to approach us it is going to be up to us to take the initiative and see our elders and to ask them questions
that way there will be a closer working relationship between the elders they ll feel that they are being effective
we have to be proud of our elders we shouldn t be intimidated by them
they are just waiting for us to ask questions
i would like to urge the representatives of the nunavut government to use the elders more

elders and youth
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i rise today to speak about our youth and elders
they are looking for ways that they can have a close working relationship
i am in support of that our young people today are going through challenging times to try and stand up on their own two feet they are looking for ways to develop themselves
our elders are dying off with their wise knowledge and our young people are our future
we have to train our young people properly for the future so that they can start thinking on their own start believing in themselves knowing that they are very capable people
our young people are very important to us for those of us who are middle aged and are less educated than the younger people we have not been able to reach up to our potential
so the young people have potential if they work hard if they are committed they can become anything they want to whether it be doctors or health care workers mechanics they can become anything they want to with commitment
so that is the power of young people through education it can happen

oral questions
question 18 - 1 3
inuit customs in the justice system
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct this question to the minister of justice
ever since april 1st when the nunavut government was established we have been saying we would be using inuit traditions and culture within the justice system
that s our goal
my question to the appropriate minister is are we going to be utilizing inuit culture within the justice system in nunavut
speaker interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
since april 1st the department of justice has been consolidated into one
usually there were two divisions and we have combined them into one to incorporate inuit knowledge so that the justice system could operate smoothly we were looking for ways to utilize the community justice committees
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to thank the minister for his response
another question i think it was last spring that i asked this question to find out your progress with the baffin correctional centre
last spring i spoke about bcc
the inmates at the baffin correctional centre need help with their social problems
they should be provided with more healing programs
my question to the minister is if you provide healing programs to the inmates at bcc
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
i would like to remind each and every one of you the rule on oral questions
during oral questions you have to ask about only one topic
you have already asked your question about the department of justice but your second question is in regards to the baffin correctional centre
i would like to remind you that you can only ask one question with one topic
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i apologize we have not set the whole thing up as yet but i think that it is part of the justice system i think his question is part of the justice system and incorporating inuit qaujimajatuqangit
but at this time we have not set up any programs
thank you
speaker interpretation

mr iqaqrialu
question 19 - 1 3
airline schedules
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i don t know if my question can be responded to but it is to the minister of transportation
in my constituency of clyde river and qikiqtarjuaq these two communities are very close to each other
the airline schedules we are concerned about them because these two communities are so close to each other but the schedule is only once on friday and saturday to qikiqtarjuaq coming from clyde river
when the weather is bad the passengers going to qikiqtarjuaq or clyde river have to wait a whole week if they can t get to their community due to bad weather
if the weather is bad again they have to wait another week therefore sometimes the passengers will wait three weeks to get to qikiqtarjuaq or clyde river
this is inappropriate and especially when a loved one dies some family members can t reach their destination
i don t know which airline schedules should be fixed or changed but i am asking this question to the minister responsible for transportation to see if they can rectify this situation
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
our department can t tell the airlines what to do but we are now finding out all of these concerns
in regards to your statement we can write a letter to convey your concern to the airline
since nunavut was created we want to see the airline schedules going to the communities frequently and i would like to tell the member here that we will relay your concern by way of letter to the appropriate airline
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
question 20 - 1 3
cost of merchandise
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister of transportation
i know that all the goods and services at the stores are very expensive for example our daily goods that we have to buy
could you do a review or study to find out how much these items cost or how expensive these are because some young families cannot even afford to buy their staples
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
i will direct your question to mr anawak since he is responsible for that portfolio
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we are very aware of the high cost of living in the nunavut settlement area
the canadian government has some programs to reduce the cost of living in nunavut but of course these programs do not go directly to the consumers for example those on social assistance
i had a meeting with nav canada when we took on the department of transportation we had a meeting with them to see if they could further reduce the costs
for example giving reduced fares for goods and services for freight
we had a meeting with nav canada and we talked about reducing the costs of freight and of course we also have to pay for landing fees
we haven t set up any programs but we would like to review the cost of living through my department
like i said we haven t completed all the reviews that we would like to do and i cannot respond to your question right at this time
speaker
mr tootoo
question 21 - 1 3
funding for classroom supplies
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is for the minister responsible for education
i would like to ask the minister responsible if the schools are funded for providing supplies necessary in the class rooms
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr speaker
the funding is given to district education authorities from the regional education council on a per student basis
the school receives o&m funding on a per capita basis
it is strictly up to the district education authorities how they spend that money
what they buy with that money is not up to the department of education
but i would like to tell the member that they are funded on a per capita basis and we have no direct control as to how they spend that
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
i would like to thank the minister for confirming how the funding is allocated to the schools
on that basis mr speaker one of the schools here in iqaluit the breakdown per classroom in order to supply them with the materials necessary for the class room i will just outline what those materials are
paint pencils and pens anything besides furniture
a class room in one of the schools here is allocated based on the formula 400 dollars a year to provide all of those materials necessary for the students in that class
mr speaker with an average class size of 25 students per class that works out in order to provide those basic materials to each student to 16 dollars per year
i would like to ask the minister of education if he feels those are adequate resources in order to provide supplies to our young children in the class rooms
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr tootoo

thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr speaker thank you
i certainly could have told the member how i feel about this
>>laughter
mr speaker the budget that is given to the department the last figure that we had in the main estimates is 133 million dollars
that creates a pie and all of these allocations are given equally on a ratio basis to district education councils or divisional education councils
that in turn through a per capita formula system is given as i said to the schools
of course these are not adequate because from this pie when we disseminate those funds then we no longer have control because they still have to pay for the teachers and the o&m and everything that goes with it
so until such time as they are given specific instructions as to how much they must spend on those materials and supplies and etc they will continue to have that freedom to allocate money for the supplies required
from that once we are given a budget from this assembly through the main estimates we really don t have much of a role to play in it

question 22 - 1 3
administrative support for elders societies
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have a question for the minister of culture language elders & youth
there are elders societies established in our communities and we have one in our community
they don t have employees or support services
they don t have secretaries to handle their administrative matters
my question to the minister is if he could look into providing positions for these so that the elders societies can have administrative support services
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
minister of culture language elders & youth mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker i could not hear him
speaker interpretation
mr nutarak had a question regarding administrative support for the elders
mr havioyak was going to respond as the minister of culture language elders & youth
we had technical difficulties
at this point we will give mr havioyak an opportunity to respond to mr nutarak s question
mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
sorry we were cut off
thank you very much mr speaker
i just want you to recognize that the person who was going to be assisting me with elders has not yet been hired
i will confirm with you who will be assisting me when the hiring is done
right now it is not confirmed and this will be looked at at a later date at which time i will confirm
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have another question for mr havioyak
when we had our meeting in april i asked this same question regarding the larger communities with larger populations
my comment in april was that if we had a full time position for the elders societies it would cost too much
so i made the suggestion that perhaps the larger communities elders societies could get a secretarial support position on a half time basis
that was just in relation to the larger communities where they have elders societies and if it s possible to get a half time position to give administrative support for these societies
the reason i am saying this is that we need to retain the elders knowledge and to have everything written down so that we don t forget our culture and our language
so my question again is would you be able to give us half time positions for the elders societies in the larger communities
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
minister for culture language elders & youth mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak
thank you mr speaker
again i want to point out that the senior advisor for the elders is still not hired today but will be hired very shortly now
that s one of the options that will be looked at by the staff
thank you

will she commit to advising the house in the january session what steps she will take to bring this important issue forward and into effect by the new year and will she commit to this
ma na uqaqti
speaker
mr mclean that s three questions on your final supplementary but again once more i will remind you that on your final supplementary it has to be one question
this time i will allow the minister to answer
minister responsible for housing ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation

speaker
mr kattuk
question 24 - 1 3
oil tank upgrade project
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the minister of public works ms thompson
when we were in our budget session it was agreed for my constituency that there would be some renovations done on our oil tanks
i was told that this was not going to go ahead any more because there was no funding available for these renovations
the contractor and i had a discussion before i came here and i was told that these tanks weren t filled to full capacity because they were going to be working on them this fall
could you give me an update on what is happening
speaker
minister responsible for public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
our department is called sanajiliriji in inuktitut
department of public works
i know that we have to come up with a better term in inuktitut but our department is called sanajilirijimi department of public works
the member for sanikiluaq informed me about his concerns on this issue and the member is also very busy dealing with other concerns
it is true that there was a proposal to renovate the tanks we were lacking in funding but now we have revised the proposal for april 2000 we will deal with that project again
so that is the information that i can give you that we will have funding for april 2000
thank you
speaker
thank you ms thompson
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
perhaps i will rephrase my question
thank you ms thompson for your response but i would like to ask if the oil tanks were filled to capacity
i was wondering if we are going to have an adequate fuel supply prior to april
if the oil tanks are not filled to capacity will we have a sufficient fuel supply for the winter
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
minister responsible for public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
if there is an insufficient fuel supply we will rectify the problem but at this point in time i have not heard about sanikiluaq being supplied with insufficient fuel
i don t know if it will be sufficient for the winter but if that has happened we will rectify the situation when we experience it
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation

mr o brien
question 25 - 1 3 elders living below poverty line
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is directed to the minister responsible for culture language elders & youth for elders in particular
mr speaker through the course of the morning we spoke with the elders and then had some comments made about the importance of elders
to my mind mr speaker we seem to always be looking to the elders for advice and looking to the elders in general
i would like to take the issue an unusual step further and say what can we do for the elders not only in this assembly but also through the other aboriginal bodies that exist in nunavut
mr speaker my question to the minister in this regard is does the minister have any idea as to how many elders may be living below the poverty line in nunavut
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for culture language elders & youth mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker and i thank the member for his question
at this time we are looking into this and i want to reply to your question accurately
i will keep this in mind and i will get back to you on that
speaker
he is not aware how many people are on the poverty line at this time until research is done
i think that is a hypothetical question mr o brien
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i made an assumption that there may be some statistics on this particular issue
my second question to the minister is would the minister commit to follow up this issue with a study a survey to find out exactly what the numbers are if they do exist thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation
yes i will look into this and get back to you again
speaker interpretation
mr puqiqnak
question 26 - 1 3
lack of job opportunities for youth
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am not too sure to whom i should be directing this question but perhaps to the community government minister
in taloyoak we met with the organizations in the community
i think they are called interagency committees they had a concern and it s a fact i believe that the children have no place to go after school
perhaps the appropriate minister has some plans to rectify this situation because there are no opportunities available for young children and that is a concern of taloyoak residents because the students have nothing to do after school
i was wondering if the minister for community government and transportation has any plans
speaker interpretation
thank you
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
i appreciate your question and i think in most of the communities we have discussed the lack of employment for young people or for young students
if our young children had things to do and if they lived a healthier lifestyle they would be better educated
interpretation ends i ll take it as notice mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak the question is taken as notice
oral questions mr nutarak
question 27 - 1 3
education act review
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct this question to the minister of education
when mr arvaluk was making his statement he said they would be working on the education act and he would table that some time in the future
i know the education act will have to be amended to reflect nunavut
how do you see proceeding with the review of the act
will you be involving the communities how are you going to be working on the amendment of the act
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
minster responsible for education
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
as i stated before we are now starting to consult with the communities and are receiving their input
now we will start drafting the act in inuktitut first
we will continue to consult with the communities and the members of the legislative assembly on the drafting of the bill in inuktitut
if we read it for the second time it will be up to the members of the legislative assembly how they want to deal with the bill
if we are going to give it to a standing committee once it has been given to the committee you will be able to consult with the communities and get their input to the bill
so once we give it to the standing committee it will be at their discretion whether they want to consult with the communities
after it is read for the second time it will be up to your discretion how long you want to work on this amendment
there was a bill passed that the regional boards of education will be dissolved
if we can have the education bill read for the third time in the spring session we will be able to implement and it will reflect nunavut s needs
it will be up to the cabinet when the third reading will happen
thank you
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions mr tootoo
question 28 - 1 3
changes to school funding
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
this question is directed to the minister of education
my colleague just discussed the reform of the education act
i would like to ask the minister if through this reform process the way the schools are funded would also be looked at
i know as you indicated earlier that it is all on formula funding and it switched to that from program funding as we were having all kinds of problems with program funding
so i would like to ask the minister if they will be looking at changes to how they are funded and not only the enactment
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr speaker naturally
so everything all the responses we will be getting from the citizens of nunavut will be considered in the rewriting of the education act
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i just wanted to ask for a clarification from the minister the way that the schools are funded is that something that is stipulated in the act
that it be formula funded or program funded is that something that is stipulated in the act
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
mr speaker i am not sure if the word stipulation would be proper at this time because we are looking at everything that needs to be included or excluded from the education act re-write
but i will assure the member that every possible subject of discussion will be included in the rewrite including how the budget is distributed to education authorities after the divisional boards of education are dissolved in july 2000
so i don t want to contemplate or stipulate any specific matter because i want to be completely open on this consultation process and that will be the basis of it
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker then i guess what i am hearing is that the minister is committing that the public has some input into how the schools are funded
in his letter that was sent out on the principals it doesn t address that
so i would like to ask if he would commit to informing the appropriate bodies for input on that exact thing
thank you mr speaker

question 29 - 1 3
public housing repairs
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you
my question is directed to the minister for housing
when i went to visit my constituency last summer some of the houses had not been retrofitted
there is one house with oil burner heating and i was wondering if your department can look into my constituency because they are still using the old system of heating
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
ms thompson hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is the very first time that i have heard about it
i don t know whether it is in repulse bay or pelly bay
could you elaborate on which community you are talking about so that i could direct my staff to look into this situation and find out what we can do to rectify the problem
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in repulse bay their houses are not built adequately they even seem to be unsafe to live in and that has to be rectified
some of the houses are still using the old stove heating system and they only have one heater in the house and it seemed to be unsafe
it is that heating stove it is so old i felt that it was unsafe
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will direct my staff to look into your concern but i think that each and every one of us are aware that o&m dollars for housing are eating up the majority of our budget
this is the very first time i have heard about this concern of repulse bay but i will direct my staff to deal with this and i will keep you updated

oral questions mr iqaqrialu
question 30 - 1 3
status of clyde river hamlet funding
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the community government minister
last june during the session of the legislative assembly we had a crisis in clyde river and i tabled that to the house at that time and this was going to be dealt with
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister responsible for community government
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in regards to mr iqaqrialu s question i know exactly where he is coming from
one of our employees has been working on this issue for quite some time
we have agreed that we will cost share a position with the hamlet council to hire a bookkeeper and i have had discussions with the sao in the community
there have been ongoing discussions with the hamlet council and my department and i would suggest that i have a meeting with mr iqaqrialu and also the mayor of clyde river
i think that we will be able to meet and discuss this further
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i know that there have been ongoing discussions between your department and the hamlet
i had a discussion with the sao the hamlet council and the employees of the hamlet council
in order to carry out proper operations i was told by the sao that they were contemplating cutting down their hours or their salary because of the deficit situation
those are some of the options that we heard from your department
if that is going to be the case it is going to create a problem for the people of clyde river and it is not a small problem
we are going to have to deal with this issue and your department and your staff and the people of clyde river are going to have to have further discussions
if you cut down on their wages or you cut down on their hours
speaker interpretation
please sit down mr mr iqaqrialu
during oral questions you can not talk about general issues but you can direct your question to the appropriate minister if you like
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
i apologize of course we all make mistakes once in a while and it doesn t intimidate me either because i learn from my mistakes
my question following the statements i made are you going to be cutting back on the employee salaries or are you going to be cutting back on their hours
speaker interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
the union negotiates the wages of the employees
the hamlet council since they were established get formula funding on a per capita basis
the hamlets if i can use an example if they are thinking about cutting back on the wages of their employees we can t do anything about it
we haven t said that this is what we are going to be doing but we have had discussions with the hamlet council and the appropriate member of the legislative assembly
if they don t want cutbacks then we would have to start dialogues again
if this problem cannot be rectified by the employees then we would meet with the member of the legislative assembly and the elected council of the clyde river hamlet
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
we have reached our hour
if you would like to ask a further question mr iqaqrialu i will give you an opportunity at this time
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have another question
these are deficits that have accumulated from the 70 s from the 80 s and the deficit has accumulated over the years and it is huge now
it wasn t the local government s fault
can we just forgive or write off the old deficit
i believe that we have to have discussions of these issues
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
like i said the communities are funded on a per capita basis
the hamlets i believe there are 26 of them in the nunavut settlement area there are some communities that are operating within their budget if they need help then we give them help
if there are problems financially in the hamlet councils we end up helping those communities and it is our staff or the hamlet staff that have dialogue to rectify the problem and afterwards it is up to us
i would like to tell the member of the legislative assembly that very likely we will have to meet with the employees of the hamlet council and also the appropriate mla

maligarnik qimirrujiit
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i wish to inform the members and bring them up to date on the progress made on the establishment of maligarnik qimirrujiit nunavut s law review commission
later today i will table the terms of reference for the commission
all members of this assembly are committed to promoting inuit values and i believe that maligarnik qimirrujiit reflects the commitment in a definitive and tangible way
a way in which nunavummiut across the territory can recognize and relate to
one of the premises of nunavut was that we would be able to make our law in areas that we have authority
in order to do this we have to review the laws that we have inherited
maligarnik qimirrujiit has important work to accomplish and we have looked to the members of this assembly to assist us in identifying people to be appointed as commissioners
i would like to thank them for bringing names forward before last friday s deadline
the commissioners need not have formal legal training
they need not speak english
primarily their work will be to identify nunavut laws that are inconsistent with the vision and goals of nunavummiut
laws that are not in keeping with inuit qaujimajatuqangit
the commissioners will be asked to identify those areas of law for review
the goal of maligarnik qimirrujiit will be to encourage public discussion and to reflect the thoughts and feelings of nunavummiut in the recommendations made to the government
that s why some of our elders need to play a prominent role in the work of the commissioners and i will be instructing maligarnik qimirrujiit to work closely with the elders in each community throughout their work

legal interpreter and justice of the peace training
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
i apologize
thank you mr speaker
i wish to inform members of two important initiatives being organized and sponsored by the nunavut department of justice
the first is the legal interpreters training program currently underway at arctic college the second is the justice of the peace training program which will start in iqaluit in november
interpretation ends the nunavut court of justice was officially created on april 1
this is a court that is unique in canada as it is the country s first single level trial court
we decided on this model because it is the best for the people of nunavut
but we continue to face challenges simply due to the make up of our territory
we need high quality interpretation in the court room in order for the new court to serve the people effectively
unfortunately the few interpreters that we have in the communities have been under trained and are working under stressful conditions
we need more qualified interpreters throughout nunavut
therefore my department has asked arctic college to select 17 applicants to take an intensive 8 week training program designed specifically for nunavut legal interpreters
once these people graduate they will return to their home communities and serve as interpreters for the nunavut court of justice
interpretation the second training program which will start in november is being designed and run by our justice of the peace co-ordinator mr neil sharkey
there has been a serious need for more qualified justices of the peace in our communities
as a territory we have made the commitment to a community based justice system
but how can we call the system community based when the court only arrives in some locations every six months
inuit justices of the peace reside in their own communities and hear cases frequently
the other important benefit is that they speak the inuktitut language and they understand the issues and dynamics of the communities in which they serve
i believe that this is another way in which we are seeing the principals of inuit qaujimajatuqangit being applied in the justice system
i would like to point out that we managed to get federal funding to cover the costs of both these training programs for two years
interpretation ends these two programs will give an important boost to the creation of the justice system at the community level and they will also result in a greater number of highly qualified inuit working in their communities

integration of health and social services health boards
hon ed picco
uqaqti i wish to inform the house of the progress achieved to date towards the integration of the three health and social services boards
we are building a unified health and social services department for nunavut
the work required for integration is mostly administrative at this time though it is complicated and it must be done well to ensure services continue to be delivered properly
this work is on track and will continue right through to april 2000
as well mr speaker i repeat that the government is committed to a no layoff policy for any employees whose jobs are affected by integration
mrs rosemary cooper assistant deputy minister of my department has also been assigned full time to the integration and decentralization initiatives
an integration co-ordinator has been contracted to assist in the integration of both education and health and social services
the integration planning committee for our senior managers of all three boards at the department has met three times
it has provided direction to a series of working committees again with participation from all three boards and the department as well as the central agencies
they re currently working on the many administrative details
mr speaker integration is only the first of a series of steps towards the building of a health and social services system designed by and for all of nunavummiut
the redesign of the current system will evolve over the next several years
it will include honouring our commitment to decentralized positions both in pangnirtung and to kugluktuk
this will certainly be part of the system design work which lies ahead
mr speaker in the meantime i have directed the department to enter into discussions with community governments regarding interim arrangements
some nunavut communities already have some form of a committee usually a sub-committee of the hamlet which considers wellness promotion and other related health and social services programs
these committees can be the focus of discussions that might take place in communities and between communities and the department
we would be prepared to provide some support to such an approach on an interim basis
mr speaker as we move through integration and begin discussions about the future i am more and more convinced that this unification of the system is the right thing to do
i look forward to providing members and the public with further details over the coming months

schools integration project
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to provide members with an update on the progress made by education nunavut on the schools integration project
as you will remember a decision was made in april of this year to dissolve both education and health boards of management by july 1 2000
since that time an implementation co-ordinator has been hired to manage the project and i am pleased with the progress we have made
i provided you with a copy of the implementation co-ordinator s handbook in august so that you would have an overview of how this project will be implemented
since april i have briefed all district education councils with the exception of the kivalliq council
i will be attending their next regularly scheduled meeting to discuss these issues as well as the re-writing of the education act
headquarters staff have also met the divisional education council with board staff and with the majority of school principals in nunavut to provide briefings and to answer questions
interpretation ends mr speaker discussions have also been held with the nunavut social development council and with the legislative standing committee on culture education and health
interpretation mr speaker i m confident this will result in more cost effective regional structures
interpretation ends organization charts for the new regional schools will be ready within the next month
we are targeting staff for appointments to re-describe positions
this will be completed before christmas
this should lessen any anxiety on the part of staff and provide the system with the required stability to do the required work that will be needed prior to july 2000
as you know there will be no layoffs as a result of the organization changes
the skilled people in the system will continue to be valuable members of the nunavut government team and if it s not possible to take place in the department of education alternate jobs will be available in other departments
interpretation mr speaker in summary the work is on schedule and i m confident that the integration schedule will be a success
the success will include a department and myself as minister of education closer and more accountable to the students and all nunavummiut

sustainable development s implementation of the bathurst priorities
hon peter kilabuk
thank you mr speaker
during the summer i had the opportunity to speak with people in my community about our government
i discussed the challenges that our government faces and the work that lies ahead with leading the department of sustainable development our department with a broad and diverse mandate
one elder said to me just recently remember peter a good dog team will work hard to get from one place to another each dog pulling in the same direction each dog knowing their role
each dog is different but they are a team and because they are a team when they work together they are powerful
they are more powerful than any snow machine
this elder reminded me that it is my job to make sure that everyone on the team knows my direction and that the traces in my hands must be taut
interpretation ends i will speak about the direction that we have established for our government as a whole in the bathurst mandate
i am pleased to be able to speak to you about the role of the department of sustainable development
after the cabinet meeting in bathurst inlet in august i called together the senior staff in my department
i outlined for them the direction i wanted our department to take in the next 180 days
i described for them five major areas in which i expect our department to provide leadership
each relates to the bathurst mandate and the four goals we set for this government
interpretation first i stressed the need for us to communicate effectively with the people of nunavut
mr speaker i travelled extensively in nunavut throughout the summer and everywhere the message was the same keep us informed about what the government is doing
so i have told my staff in sustainable development people expect that we will faithfully and regularly communicate with them
i want my department to be a leader in the government s effort
secondly i have asked my department to strengthen it s community presence
we must work to provide more support for our wildlife officers and for the community economic development officers in each community
thirdly i have stated in this house before and i emphasized it again with my staff that job creation is a priority of our department
speaker
mr kilabuk can you please be seated
i apologize your time of 20 minutes is up and you can request consent from the members to continue
hon peter kilabuk
i would like to request consent from the members
speaker
thank you mr kilabuk
mr kilabuk has requested to continue with his minister s statement
any objections
mr kilabuk you have a consensus
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
a key to job creation is a partnership with the federal government
interpretation ends we have been successful negotiating with the federal government recent agreements with natural resources canada and diand to establish a geoscience officer in iqaluit rather in nunavut and this can make a major contribution to our economy
moreover mr speaker i have reasonable hopes that our current negotiations with diand will result in the establishment of a nunavut economic development agreement this year
i cannot emphasize enough the gains and benefits of working with our partners both in economic development and in our co-management responsibilities for our environment and our wildlife
interpretation the bathurst mandate calls for nunavummiut to be self-reliant
self-reliance is not being able to go at it alone self-reliance is pulling your weight as part of a team making full use of your own resources and abilities
when we combine our resources and abilities with others in partnership each one is stronger
as a fourth priority i am determined that we must simplify our program delivery
again mr speaker i have told my senior staff that we must emphasize improvements in communication explain our programs and policies and make them clear and simple so that the public can understand and take full advantage of them
finally mr speaker i have told my staff of the pride i take in the leadership they have provided in our efforts in this government to apply inuit qaujimajatuqangit
this government team we have been told is making a trail in new snow
our elders have pointed to the direction we must take and inuit qaujimajatuqangit reminds us that learning is not only about discovering what is ahead of us
learning must be about understanding who we are and how we can use our strengths to find our way into the future
interpretation ends i would like to refer briefly now to specific programs my department will be undertaking in the next six months which will address the bathurst mandate directly
mr speaker through my travels this summer i have heard from our hunters about the existing wildlife act and it s outdated approach to wildlife management
as i have said previously in this house i am committed to modernizing our wildlife act and i will be bringing forward recommendations on how we can approach this very large process of reform
this important new proposed legislation will be brought to cabinet only after extensive public consultation
a major part of the work of my department is dedicated to community capacity building
we work routinely with our partners in other government departments the inuit organizations hamlets and the federal government on wellness community development labour force development and economic development
community planning is essential to our work
interpretation we will continue to provide direct financial support to communities wishing to establish their development plans
we will continue our support for community economic development officers and their professional organization the nunavut economic developers association
interpretation ends concerning my statements on the nunavut economy made during the last session
we are working toward an economic strategy for nunavut
to this end i am committing to a consultation process in which i will invite participants from each community to contribute to the creation of a nunavut plan for economic development
i anticipate this process beginning early in the new calendar year
but in the meantime mr speaker my department will continue to pursue opportunities for our growing labour force
my department is presently conducting background research on the creation programs that i hope will lead to the establishment of another partnership in nunavut s job force to address the needs of our young adults for work in our communities
i ve already stated how important i regard communication by government with the public
this is the key to achieving the goal we set in bathurst to simplify government
my department produces and distributes a wide range of information ranging from permits and licenses to wildlife and environmental protection
all these documents and publications currently are being revised and translated to make them more accessible and understandable to people
mr speaker as part of our efforts to simplify and enhance business support programs we will continue the implementation of one stop program delivery with our partners in each region
at first this will involve linking our programs with those of the regional community future organizations and we will continue to work toward one stop program delivery with the inuit organizations as well
we will continue to support nunavut development corporations
my department will maintain our assistance to nunavut tourism the nunavut arts and crafts association and the nunavut economic developers association
organizations whose work directly effects our economic prospects in nunavut
mr speaker i have spoken about some of the ways my department will support the bathurst mandate in the achievement of three goals healthy communities simplicity in government and self-reliance
mr speaker let me conclude by referring to the fourth and last goal learning
much of the work of my department depends on training and capacity building
our people must have the knowledge and skills to take full advantage of our rich economic prospects
in the mining industry for example we have identified opportunities for trades training that can be delivered in nunavut and nunavut tourism was recently recognized as nunavut s training council for the tourism industry
we will work with our partners in education to help ensure nunavummiut are able to assume important roles and the majority of the jobs in the development of our mining industry
we have a labour force in nunavut mr speaker with distinct characteristics some of which are unique among working people in canada
interpretation mr speaker i feel very confident that we have a good working team at the department of sustainable development
that we can pull our weight and help to ensure this government reaches the goals that we set in bathurst inlet

coral harbour bridge
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i stand today concerning the bridge that was built recently in salliit coral harbour
i just came back recently and i was able to use that bridge myself and i wanted to mention that today
the government staff and the community people are benefiting from that because coral harbour residents have been working really hard towards getting that bridge
the contractors even though it wasn t in the terms of reference of the contract did over and beyond the call in trying to get the project done
even though it is not quite complete the bridge is being used and it s really obvious that it has benefited and it has shown that it benefits the people in the community of coral harbour
it has really encouraged them that nunavut is there for them
i am sure that a lot of people who would have just stayed home without having transportation are able to use the bridge to go out on the land and relax
i am sure it is obvious that it is going to help them spiritually and it will benefit the people

suicide prevention
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i rise today to make the same statement that i made when we were opening up our first meeting in april in regards to suicide
suicides in my community started in the 60 s and from there i have lost three of my immediate family members to suicide in the 1980 s
i used to think mr speaker that after i lost three of my immediate family members through suicide it was too late to do anything about suicide prevention
afterwards i found out that suicide is not going to stop and we have to work hard to prevent it
i would like to tell all nunavummiut that i will do anything i can in helping to prevent suicide and will make the same statement that i made last session and you can either take it or leave it
i know that even if we use a lot of money suicide will always keep happening there is not much we can do
we can never find out what causes suicides because there are a lot of reasons that make people commit suicide
those who are very serious about committing suicide will never tell anybody what their reasons are
it is only after the fact that we find out how serious their problems were
i would like to re-emphasize that at 12 o clock we have to pray with our children so that there is less suicide in the communities whether in iqaluit or in our home communities
i would like to urge the members here through my third statement that we have to help our people of nunavummiut
i am speaking from my heart when i say that we should pray together with our children in order to prevent suicide from happening
thank you mr speaker

oral questions
question 31 - 1 3
integration of health & social services
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have a question that i will direct to the minister of health i think it was on the 22nd that you made some comments and this is in relation to that
in your opening remarks you said you would give the communities more authority in the future
i know there is going to be an amalgamation of the three health boards
in regards to community empowerment how long is it going to take to give more authority to the communities and fully implement community empowerment
speaker
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
qujannamiik mr speaker
with that we are trying to figure out what we will have after april 1st 2000
for example in the education system with the three education boards we know that we have local education authorities on the ground after they are dissolved after the education boards are dissolved
but in health we didn t have anything on the ground except in some communities we had sub-committees of health under the communities or community health committees
we should have a community based approach looking at empowerment issues
so i appreciate the member s question
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
oral questions
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
and again you said that there was almost a 9 million dollar deficit with the health boards
in regards to this deficit what caused the deficit and why was there an accumulation of all these deficits over the years
speaker
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker to use a phrase that s the sixty four thousand dollar question
but to be serious the 8 9 million dollar deficit as of march 31st of this year was announced because the three health boards tabled their audited statements
it would indicate that the debt the 8 9 million dollars that has been discussed publicly was previous to the nunavut government being set up
through our analysis that we are trying to do right now within the department of health & social services it seems to be consistent underfunding in the department of health since the gnwt
over the past several years the health boards have come forward with supplementary appropriations within the budget framework to be able to re-float or to re-base the health budget in the gnwt
as of april 1st when nunavut took over we inherited that 8 9 million dollars
we are seeing instances of diabetes we are seeing increases in cancers indeed mr speaker we are seeing increases in other diseases like rsv and respiratory diseases
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my last question
the government of the nwt had quite a huge deficit and i believe it was in the 32 million dollar range where they had their deficit
you didn t pay the gnwt s deficit of 32 million dollars when we became nunavut
i believe that is included did you pay for the gnwt deficit mr picco
speaker
thank you
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i am wondering if the member could repeat i only got part of the question
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
if you could rephrase your question mr nutarak he didn t hear part of the question
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
did you pay for that 32 million dollar deficit from the nunavut government
speaker
thank you mr nutarak
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
so that s all i can speak to mr speaker not the 32 million if that is the question
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation

oral questions
oral questions
mr iqaqrialu
question 32 - 1 3
government support for unilingual businesspersons
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the department of sustainable development regarding the minister s statement
you mentioned about supporting the small business in the communities about having a credit union or having some kind of grants and loans programs for the small businesses
my question is can the unilingual people who can t read and write english how are you going to improve the benefits for them from the statements that you made earlier
because at times small business owners who are unilingual when they try to get funding from the government or different organizations they have road blocks along the way as they can t speak or read english
i think we should definitely have something simple in place like an application form to be used by unilingual people
are you going to come up with something like that for them
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you
i believe you had two questions there there was one for sustainable development
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
since we just started with the department we have been reviewing all the application forms and all the forms that have to be filled out and how to make proposals
i reviewed that this year
for the unilingual who can t speak or write in english as you mentioned earlier we have been trying to review forms to make it simpler for everyone not just for unilingual people
if they want to start a small business we are trying to set up a place where they can apply for funding
we are trying to put together consistent application forms for everybody
speaker interpretation
thank you
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have a question for the minister of ntpc
speaker interpretation
mr iqaqrialu you have to ask your questions to only one minister on the same subject
so if you are going to ask a question of the minister of ntpc you will have to wait for later
mr iqaqrialu do you have a question for the same minister
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
we have to leave very shortly i can ask tomorrow
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
i don t want to stop you or anything but when you are asking a minister a question you have to direct your questions to the same minister before you ask another question

definition of inuit qaujimajatuqangit
mr irqittuq interpretation

during our present sitting you kept mentioning inuit qaujimajatuqangit when we are sitting in the house
what exactly does inuit qaujimajatuqangit mean
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
inuit qaujimajatuqangit is interpreted in several different ways but we try to use it in the best possible ways
we do meet with our elders and just last month we met with them through the department of sustainable development on trying to put ideas together on how to use inuit qaujimajatuqangit in the daily business of our departments
we are now in the process of looking at the legislation of the government and our elders are our mentors in trying to get inuit qaujimajatuqangit implemented in our laws
inuit qaujimajatuqangit had been misinterpreted in the past and right now our department is reviewing all of this information and putting it together
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr premier
oral questions mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
inuit qaujimajatuqangit you want to include this in your departments or in the nunavut government
if you are going to use inuit qaujimajatuqangit for example is that going to give us more power in our activities or in our governance
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr okalik
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
as i mentioned earlier we are trying to use inuit qaujimajatuqangit as much as possible and we are going to review how we can better use it in the department and we are getting direction from the elders
we are all using them as our mentors to include inuit qaujimajatuqangit and how we can better use it in our daily business
so we don t just leave it on the side because i am sure it is really going to benefit us in the future

hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it gives me great pleasure to rise before the house today to make this announcement
when i was elected as premier i stated that i would review the need to appoint a deputy premier and make a decision once i was able to evaluate this need
our government has now had seven months of experience and i feel that it is now time to make this decision
it is becoming more and more clear mr speaker that there has to be a strong clearly identified deputy premier to maintain the confidence of the people of nunavut and of this house if i am away
a deputy premier that recognizes the wonderful diversity of nunavut

inuktitut training for nunavut government employees
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i rise today to advise the members of this house on the importance of inuktitut language usage in our daily government business activities
on october 19 1999 the government of nunavut initiated the first session of inuktitut language training for the government of nunavut employees in iqaluit
this initiative is a joint undertaking between the departments of human resources education and culture language elders & youth who instituted this language training program
the purpose of the inuktitut training program is to improve the way we serve the public
our government is committed to providing inuktitut training for all public servants and this is what we should be moving forward on in this area
this is only an initial pilot project in the new year courses will be taught throughout nunavut at various skill levels
the courses will be developed through the nunavut arctic college as they have community learning centres in most of the communities
participants will learn the inuktitut dialect of their home community or region
instruction will begin in basic inuktitut and will reflect the language needs of the office environment
mr speaker this language training is consistent with the governments mandate to use inuktitut as a working language
we encourage all employees to participate and advance their language skills

income support policy review
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am pleased to announce that the department of education will be undertaking a policy review for the income support program
the income support program as inherited from the gnwt is a program that requires new thinking on the part of the nunavut government
the department of education must work toward changing the image of a welfare department to one that is employment and education focused while still continuing to provide support to those who are unable to work
we as a government must encourage self-reliance instead of dependence
we must continue to work toward the goal of community capacity building by having communities take ownership of and involvement in the identification of needs and in the design development and implementation of policies programs and services
interpretation mr speaker this policy review will solicit the views of nunavut citizens and provide direction to the government on how to redesign the current program
the report resulting from the review will be used as the foundation for the development of a more responsive and effective income support program for residents of nunavut
the community consultation process will be lead by a forum of nunavut citizens appointed by myself
interpretation ends i will keep this assembly advised of the progress we make on this very important issue
thank you mr speaker

nunavut emergency plan approval
hon jack anawak interpretation
interpretation ends i wish to thank the various deputy ministers and their senior staff who have worked in consultation to produce this plan as required under the civil emergency measures act of nunavut
this plan will ensure a co-ordinated immediate response by the government of nunavut to any form of peacetime emergency
interpretation it strengthens our role in working together in co-operation with our local authorities in aiding them in dealing with emergencies within their individual communities
we need to work closely with our local communities who have considerable knowledge in dealing with situations within their home communities
my nunavut emergency services staff will work to ensure other agencies with lead responsibilities are listening to and reacting positively to community concerns and directions
interpretation ends the plan now approved will be translated into the official languages of nunavut and put into clearly marked binders for distribution across nunavut
once this plan is released we will have complied with both our act and the mou on emergency preparedness entered into with the federal government
at the same time work is continuing on updating the regional plans
support will also be provided to our local authorities in drafting their new peacetime plans
finally please join with me in thanking the many many volunteers who assist in the area of emergency services these are the people of nunavut who unfortunately do not get the recognition that they deserve
far too often they do not even hear a word of thank you following the long and sometimes stressful hours they have put in on an emergency
it is my hope that we can recognize these individuals in a more positive way to this end i will be seeking your input and would welcome any suggestions that you may have
thank you

inuit qaujimajatuqangit
hon donald havioyak
qoanna uqaqti
i am pleased to speak to the house about inuit qaujimajatuqangit
the government of nunavut recognizes that the inuit of nunavut have acquired a vast store of inuit qaujimajatuqangit through their experience of living in close harmony with the land
as minister for the department of culture language elders & youth i feel that we must continue the use of inuit qaujimajatuqangit and support in its practical application
inuit qaujimajatuqangit is a valid and essential source of information about people s relationships with each other the formation of health communities and as a guiding principle for governance
inuit qaujimajatuqangit is also a valid and essential source of information about the natural environment the use of natural resources and the relationship of people to the land
there are several guiding principles that are helping us in our efforts
we believe that we must work in close co-operation with the nunavut social development council as described in article 32 of the land claims agreement
perceive oral tradition as a reliable source of information about inuit qaujimajatuqangit
develop and deliver programs and services in the manner consistent with beliefs customs knowledge values and language of the people being served
this means that inuit qaujimajatuqangit must be a primary consideration in the design and delivery of the government programs services and policies
the department of culture language elders & youth has been working very hard to promote and support inuit qaujimajatuqangit in our government
our department has begun development of the inuit qaujimajatuqangit policy
consultations about this draft policy have begun and we presented a version at the nunavut social development council s board meeting at the end of september
the policy proposes to establish inuit qaujimajatuqangit co-ordinators within each department in the government
our first inuit qaujimajatuqangit workshop was held in iqaluit to determine what inuit qaujimajatuqangit means and to make recommendations for implementation
the government of nunavut employees attended the workshop and various elders from the communities were our resource people
a report of this first workshop will be available by the end of the month
our government has received the nunavut social development councils report on traditional knowledge and we are using it as one of our guiding principles
the department of culture language elders & youth is a part of an inuit qaujimajatuqangit working group with representatives from the different departments
this group has worked hard to keep inuit qaujimajatuqangit in the forefront of the government and supported its development as our department gathers momentum
the department of culture language elders & youth has created a inuit qaujimajatuqangit co-ordinator position that will assist us to priorize inuit qaujimajatuqangit throughout the government
inuit qaujimajatuqangit makes us different from other governments
we have a unique identity and must be proactive in integrating it into our everyday governance

nunavut s business incentive policy
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker i rise today to advise the members of the legislative assembly regarding our progress in reviewing the nunavut business incentive policy
mr speaker i am pleased to announce to the members and the public that i have established a working group that will focus it s efforts on reviewing this policy
it is my intention that this working group will seek input from and consult with all members of the legislative assembly representatives of the communities the public nunavut tunngavik inc business leaders and interested groups
interpretation ends mr speaker the business incentive policy forms the backbone of this governments commitment to level the playing field between the southern business competitors nunavut businesses and inuit owned businesses
as well the development of this policy demonstrates the commitment of this government to adhere to our obligations under the nunavut land claim agreement
our willingness to support nunavut businesses and inuit firms in coming first will have a positive influence on inuit employment and training
interpretation mr speaker over the coming weeks the business incentive policy working group will be actively soliciting your input and direction
it is planned that the working group will be touring the communities and hosting public meetings in november
interpretation ends mr speaker out timelines to review this policy are short as the nunavut business incentive policy needs to be in place for the next contracting season
it is my hope that a final draft will be ready for public review early in the new year

opposition to time change
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
to represent my constituency i also would like to make a member s statement in regards to the premier s comment
it is quite on the contrary to what he has just stated
having one time zone in nunavut was initiated by the mayors of nunavut and they discussed that it would be ideal to have one time zone for nunavut
this was initiated now that at that time that happened and later on during the nunavut tunngavik agm in cambridge bay this was also discussed and i was at that meeting myself when they discussed the single time zone
mr speaker we were so glad to have one time zone for nunavut
but then there was always a but that kept coming up in the single time zone debate when the change was initiated the minds of the baffin region had been changed when they realized what was happening
we should have discussed the time change with our constituents
at this time if that s implemented it will be noon hour right now
perhaps in the month of december we d be out of this house by the time it gets really dark outside
on single time zone issue i will be working very hard against it and i will ask oral questions tomorrow on it

relocation of sanikiluaq residents
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
today i rise to talk about my community of sanikiluaq
at the end of 60s sanikiluaq residents were relocated from two settlements a north camp and a south camp
the federal government and our previous gnwt had relocated us to live in one settlement
they said it would be better if we had moved to one settlement
so they had relocated some of the people who were in their own camps the relatives brothers and sisters
they had a conflicts with each other because of the relocation
i remember back then i was a student in the school at the time when i was almost at the verge of getting out of school when they relocated us
i remember and i have seen and experienced being moved from the south camp
however i m very proud that the old camp was cleaned up last year sponsored by the federal government through qikiqtani inuit association
when the old camp was cleaned up it was quite difficult for some people
we felt the emotions of the people because the old homes were burned down
in spite of that i know it did not have an impact on all the community residents of sanikiluaq but it had an impact on the people who lived in that camp
so they established a committee to deal with this issue and mr speaker the committee will be looking for funds through the aboriginal programs

mr o brien

mr speaker if we re to have true decentralization i believe that you have to take all the steps necessary to make that happen

minister responsible for housing ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the original plan was to have the president based here
when i say here it s iqaluit the capital of nunavut
the ministers are based here in the capital
that was the original plan and the adms could be based elsewhere in the outlying communities of nunavut
i am the only minister without a deputy minister in the capital and as you know housing is a very important issue for nunavut

hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
that was a misinterpretation i did not say this was a short term solution
the position was always in iqaluit
i ve already talked to the adm of housing and she indicated that they ve been travelling quite a bit back and forth to iqaluit and she doesn t see a problem where the deputy minister is placed here in iqaluit
it s not going to be short term this is where the position is going to be
thank you
speaker
thank you ms thompson
mr o brien would you like to rephrase your question
mr o brien i will allow your final supplementary
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i believe that the words that the minister used was for the time being and i assume that to mean for this time or short time as i think anybody else would
i guess to rephrase and maybe to add to my question there s still going to be travel whether the president is going to arviat or in iqaluit so i don t really see where that makes much of a difference
so i guess back to my question i asked the minister if she would consider after a year this position being located to the headquarters community

question 38 - 1 3
summer student employment
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have a question for the minister of education
i believe that s the appropriate minister
i would like know if there s anything in the education act that we inherited from the gnwt for students who are employed in the summer
there were summer student employment programs held in the summer in my community and they also had programs for drop outs
is there such legislation
i would like to know if there s a clause in the legislation that says that they have to have first priority
speaker interpretation
mr puqiqnak thank you
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
there was no money available last year but at this time we are planning to set up a program for older students so they can be employed in the summer
we re planning to set up such a program so that the students can be employed during the summer
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i know that
well we know that during the summer break the students fill out forms in order to be employed for the summer
there s also the other students who have dropped out of school
they re no longer in the school system and usually these drop outs don t even know how to fill out forms and some of them have children and they re very young parents
i could use my community as an example
it s a very small community and there s very high unemployment in the smaller communities
there s seasonal employment in the summer and the drop outs are not given as much opportunity as the ones who are off for the summer
it seems like first priority is given to the kids who are in school
it seems like it s a bonus for those students and nothing for the drop outs and i would like to suggest that these summer student programs be open to all teenagers and to all young people
speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
i don t hear a question
i would like to remind the house that if you re going to be asking a question you could use an example and then ask a question at the end of your statement
you go to the preamble and then ask your question afterwards following the house rules

mr nutarak
question 39 - 1 3 pond inlet school
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
there s three schools in pond inlet at this time and the third one was closed for safety reasons
this was a school that would have been utilized by the students and there is a shortage of classroom space to accommodate the students
the pond inlet education authority has been asking the minister of education to add additional classrooms to ulaayuk school and of course there s no gym in it either
there was a school built this fall and the gym is too small to accommodate the students so they re kind of in an uncomfortable situation
i believe the education authority has been asking the minister of education to make additions to the ulaayuk school to expand the size of the gym

the minister of education mr arvaluk
mr arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker yes i have reviewed this
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
mr nutarak interpretation
since you said you ve reviewed it i believe the education authority in pond inlet has written a letter
i would like to get a copy of your response to the education authority
i would like to see a copy of your response and my question to the minister of education is since he said he s reviewing it how long is the planning stage going to be
are you going to be making additions this summer or is it going to be in next year s budget
speaker
thank you mr nutarak
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes
but there s too much difference between the two schools the years that they were built so we couldn t come to an agreement on that one and the older school was closed for safety reasons
after we got a letter from the education authority s chair we took this into consideration
these are able to be drawn the blueprints for the higher classes the gym is too small and we re also getting architectural drawings for a larger gym
we re looking at 400 thousand dollars for architects so they could develop blueprints for these two schools possible additional classrooms and gym and the high school gym to be expanded
so we re going to be trying to find out from the community whether it s supported by the people of pond inlet
thank you
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions mr o brien
question 40 - 1 3
budget consultations
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the minister of finance
mr speaker we ve had some discussions regarding the teams that have been set up with mlas and ministers to tour the various communities or all the communities of nunavut in reference to the budget process and related issues
i m wondering if the minister would give some more rationale to the people of nunavut regarding the intent and what we hope will be outcome of these consultations thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien hon kelvin ng
mr speaker the intent would be twofold
to identify not just from the perspective of capital needs but also from the perspective of program needs so it s a free flow
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr ng
oral questions
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
so i guess my question is
the input and the information that we gather will it really have an impact on for example this year s capital budget and program
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker yes it would have some impact on this year s budget development both from a program and capital perspective but i think the honourable member raises a good point on the issue of expectations
and in respect to the member s comments about capital needs we know the needs the demands and the needs far exceed what resources we have to deliver on a yearly basis as it stands now
i think there would be a concern that we don t want to create false expectations that we can deliver everything that communities or individuals may want out there
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr ng
mr o brien
i would like to caution members that we do have interpreters and we do have unilingual members here
please take your time to answer or ask questions and respect the members here

oral questions mr akesuk
question 41 - 1 3
effects of decentralization
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we have two schools but they are filled to capacity and our student teacher ratio is quite high in one of the schools in our community
in the past when it was gnwt the blueprint had been completed for the adult education school in cape dorset
i was wondering if the minister can review this again as a priority for the adult education school if that school is built it could alleviate a lot of space needs
thank you
speaker
minister for education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes i know that was planned in the past and the letters are so small i can t even see the numbers
i m not trying to say i don t know but in the month of november we will be touring all the communities of nunavut
during that tour i want to hear more from the cape dorset residents
so i d like to get their input
but at this point i can say we do have a five year plan
however i don t want to say what the residents of cape dorset want until i go visit the community
thank you
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions
mr iqaqrialu
question 42 - 1 3
time zone out of order time zone change
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
i would like to ask the premier of nunavut about the single time zone
the keewatin and kitikmeot time change will not impact on their daylight
the reason i would like to ask this is when are we going to discuss this topic of single time zones
i would like to ask the premier when we are going to discuss this in the house
speaker interpretation
thank you
in regards to your question i will rule you out of order
it has to be dealt with by the committee of the whole
this has been referred to the appropriate committee and it must be deliberated upon in the committee of the whole
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker i hope we re not going to have to wait until the day we change the clocks on the 31st thank you
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu we ll deal with that before october 31st
mr irqittuq
question 43 - 1 3
contractors use of government equipment
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i asked this question last spring and the question i asked at that time had an impact on two different ministers
i don t know if i ll be asking the minister for transportation or for human resources
my question was never replied to
i don t know if it was replied to by written response
i have not seen a written response as of yet
my question was because anybody in the nunavut area can put in a bid for a contract can the contractor utilize government equipment in order to benefit themselves to win a contract
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr irqittuq thank you
minister of public works and services ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
interpretation
thank you mr speaker this question was brought up by that same member
i did direct one member of my staff to work on this issue but since this person got another job i am assuming that the appropriate response wasn t given
the original question was whether employees could use airport staff
the deputy minister ross mrazek was not aware of the issue that was happening in that particular community and i apologize that i didn t know about it either
there was a change in staff and the deputy ministers so this issue wasn t dealt with
mr ross mrazek is presently working on it
i ll take that as notice
thank you
speaker
interpretation
thank you
it s taken as notice by the minister
thank you ms thompson
oral questions
mr puqiqnak
question 44 - 1 3
priority over dropouts
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have a question on the same issue i raised earlier
i want to get further clarification on it first
the question is for the minister of education regarding students who are given first priority over dropouts is there a regulation or law
speaker
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
its part of the program criteria
this program was set up so that the students could be employed over the summer with preference over dropouts just during the summer
as for dropouts as long as they re in canada they can look for jobs anywhere anytime
but this program is specifically geared towards students who are on summer break
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions
mr puqiqnak
interpretation
yes i understand that
i do understand it but who has more authority are the deas given authority to put first priority on the students for this program
speaker
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr speaker these program dollars from the government are funnelled possibly through the hamlet council or the dea
these particular monies are funnelled through an agency and there s an agreement between the two parties
through a contribution agreement probably for his community these program dollars would specifically say that it would be used for students for the summer break
we would make a contribution agreement saying that these monies would be specifically geared for the summer students
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
mr nutarak
question 45 - 1 3
invitation to education minister
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker i don t recall putting up my hand but since you called my name i might as well ask a question
i had already written down my question and i think you found out that i wanted to make a comment even before i said anything
my question is to the minister of education
on november 30 the minister has been invited to go to pond inlet
the same invitation is extended to myself and to the minister of education
i would like to get a copy of your response to that correspondence from the dea
so my question is are you going to be coming up to pond inlet on november 30 as you were invited
thank you mr speaker

clyde river school renovations
mr iqaqrialu interpretation

i would like to direct my question to the minister of education
we were doing our main estimates in june in our june sitting and there have to be renovations done to the school in my community
i have yet to see workers who would be going up there to renovate the school
my question is if the blueprints are going to be ready and the 400 thousand that was approved for my community to go ahead with the blueprints was there so i am wondering if that s going to go ahead

mr kattuk
question 48 - 1 3 dea s terms of reference
mr kattuk interpretation
my question is directed to the minister of education we were told by the department of health that there s going to be a dissolution of the three health and education boards before july 2000
my question is do the deas know what their terms of reference are going to be
speaker
minister responsible for education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
interpretation
thank you mr speaker yes they will know what their terms of reference are
mr ken lovely has been directed to look into these issues and we have met with the divisional board and as the member from sanikiluaq knows walter audla the chair of the dea
we will want to continue discussions with the divisional boards as we ve been doing to date
the divisional board staff will keep working and will report directly to my portfolio
so there will be an ongoing process and mr speaker we re looking forward to it
we would like the communities to decide what responsibilities they will take and give an estimate on how much it would cost to take on those additional responsibilities at the community level

mr mclean
question 49 - 1 3
airline routes
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
nunavut is on its way
we re into our seventh month and i know the centres of the universe are in strategic locations and airlines have got to recognize that the traffic patterns are changing in nunavut
i was just reading an ad in a magazine more flights more choices by one of the largest airlines in nunavut
but i m leading to my question here which is with the creation of nunavut the regional air carriers the large carriers have totally forgotten about maybe running some flights from gjoa haven pelly bay cambridge bay directly into iqaluit
is there any kind of plan for the minister to sit down and say can we bring the kitikmeot into the equation or into the traffic patterns coming to the capital and maybe bypass yellowknife now and then
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister responsible for mr premier

thank you mr premier
oral questions
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
that s very good that we are doing these things that s beneficial to all of us
but getting back to decentralization my favourite topic
gjoa haven is a decentralized community cambridge bay kugluktuk arviat baker rankin and communities like that
so there s going to be more traffic between certain areas and i wonder if the minister responsible has taken that and given it to the statistician to see if there could be an increased traffic flow in those areas
so has that been considered also with decentralization coming on too the increased traffic patterns
ma na
speaker
ma na mr mclean
mr premier
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
so that was one of the main focuses for cambridge bay we thought we would try it out and see how much traffic there is
but we are open to other communities that may want some surveys done with our employees
thank you mr speaker

mr o brien
question 50 - 1 3
list of consultants
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is to the premier and i realize that he probably doesn t have this information at his fingertips although he may
and would the premier be prepared to have that information to the house prior to the close of this session
there shouldn t be that many people but if he would do that i would appreciate it
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
mr premier
hon paul okalik
could the member clarify if it is for every single contract this government has issued since april 1
speaker
thank you mr premier please clarify your question mr o brien
mr o brien
yes since we started on april 1
if that information could be made available to the house
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr okalik
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
there are some contracts that we assumed as well before april 1 so how far back do we go
there are some contracts that we inherited and we extended as required for the services
so how far should i go in trying to meet the members concerns
speaker interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
i was aware that there were some commitments that had already been agreed to that s why i indicated since april 1 since we started the government
new contracts from that point on
speaker
thank you mr o brien
mr premier
hon paul okalik
well i am not exactly sure i could take it as notice as we have maybe three more days left of sitting so i may not be able to commit to getting that in the hands of the members
so i will take it as notice

question 51 - 1 3
pay equity
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
concerning the recent announcement by the public service alliance in regard to the pay equity victory
we know that it is going to cost the federal government five billion dollars to deal with their employees and it is being appealed
could the minister responsible advise me as to how this is going to affect us
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
i was wrong i would like to correct that for the record it was not a supreme court ruling it was a federal court ruling
but the federal government hasn t decided whether or not they are going to proceed with a possible supreme court appeal on that ruling
so right now the gnwt who has the lead on this has tried to analyze exactly what are the impacts of this and of course the impact on the government of nunavut is a part of that analyses
so i don t have that information as of today but we are certainly aware of it mr speaker
thank you
speaker
thank you mr ng
oral questions
mr mclean
mr mclean

i realize the minister doesn t have that information today but the figure that i remember when the old government of the nwt was around surrounding the pay equity issue was around 80 million dollars if the public servants won

mr iqaqrialu
question 52 - 1 3
awarding of contracts
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
to the minister of human resources this document states that in february or march the private business policy would be amended
but to date last june we stated and passed a motion that the various contracts would be awarded to nunavut companies
there was a motion passed in june which i have seen and this has not been adhered to
if the nunavut companies are not going to be awarded contracts in nunavut then we are not going to develop nunavut
perhaps in the month of february and march 2000 does that mean that we won t be awarded any contracts in nunavut
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister of public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the policy is going to be reviewed because we have inherited the business incentive policy form the gnwt
we are still using it at this point in time we had made a small change and under a minister s statement i announced that the change was from nwt to nunavut
we still have to amend that incentive policy
we are looking at how we can incorporate article 24 into the business policy but the policy is in place
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
mr o brien
speaker
sorry mr o brien
i don t know if the interpretation was accurate
question period is over until there s a motion to extend the question period
question period is over
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
mr speaker i move to extend the question period
thank you mr speaker

there is motion on the floor and the motion is not debatable
all those in favour

thank you mr speaker and to my colleague for extending question period and to the rest of my colleagues for agreeing to it

my question is to the minister of transportation
earlier in the day i was expounding on the virtues of air traffic in nunavut
has the minister initiated any discussions with the airlines about travel routes in the last six months and making nunavut more accessible for everyone in nunavut the smaller communities the larger communities also
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister responsible for transportation mr anawak
hon jack anawak
thank you mr speaker
even before the election while i was in the position of interim commissioner of nunavut i initiated talks with the airlines about the possibility of the air routes changing

question 55 - 1 3
gun legislation
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i asked this question last spring so i will be asking it over again in regards to gun legislation
we know that the gun legislation is not compatible with the inuit life style and we have been lobbying the government and we were going to be lobbying against the federal government in ottawa
so i would like to ask the minister of justice what kind of developments there have been
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i apologize i was going to update the members of the house on the developments but our staff member is now touring the communities to announce the people who will be working on this locally in the communities
last summer i had spoken to him i am not sure which communities he has visited so far but in the communities he has visited he has had a great turnout every time he went to a community
i will inform you when i receive a further update and then i will also consult with you about any developments

the inuit people in the communities have to adhere to the gun legislation
i want one of the staff members to consult with the hunters and the inuit people locally to make sure that they know what they are doing
speaker
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes the federal government would have to pay for this type of consultation process
we are now working on the gun legislation but the federal government will have to work on this other part and we would just be supporting them

question 56 - 1 3
lobbying for funding
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
now that i am going to be asking my question i am sure that we will be running out of time
to the minister of finance
my question is the funding that we received last year for the o&m of nunavut is inadequate to date and we now realize that this funding is inadequate and there are great needs out there
i am sure that all our needs and our priorities are not going to go ahead due to limited funds
have you approached the federal government to see if we can get more funding for those departments
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker not directly
i know that different ministers at different meetings with their federal counterparts have brought up issues on specific needs or plan on undertaking that initiative if they haven t already
so not from the perspective of formula funding
thank you
speaker
thank you mr ng
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
due to a shortage of funds do you have any plans to review the situation again
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
he has responded to you but i will allow him to give you another response
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker

i think also a fact that has been brought up is that those boards carried over some deficits as of april 1
we are trying to deal with that and rectify that situation to make sure there s sufficient funding for the delivery of health and social services programs
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr ng
your last supplementary mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i also would like to ask again up to april or rather march of the year 2000 we expect to be in a deficit of 20 million dollars
i was wondering if this was a fact or an estimate
could you elaborate for me
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker if the honourable member is speaking about the government of nunavut we don t expect to be in a deficit for this current operating year
and there s also by the same token the matter i indicated earlier of their deficits carried forward as of april 1 1999
it s a matter of how the financial management board is going to deal with the issue of funding for current year operations and how they are going to deal with the deficits of the three boards

pelly bay gymnasium
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will direct my question to the minister of education
i asked this question previously in regards to the gymnasium in the school
i know the year 2000 is coming this winter only a couple of months from now
i was wondering if your department has plans to build a gymnasium for our school in the up-coming year
thank you

thank you mr alakannuark
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i had written a letter to mr iyaqsaa the mayor in regards to this issue
i received a letter on october 8 from him
i was only able to respond by saying that we would be doing a community tour and this was in your capital plan
i approached him by saying look at the capital plans and if indeed we inherited it from the gnwt but i cannot respond to you whether or not we will or will not fund it this winter
the government s priorities are on the priorities of communities so i ll have to speak to him and then i can get back to you and discuss this matter again
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark
thank you mr speaker
the reason i asked that question is because the previous government i believe set aside some money for the gymnasium and i saw the blue prints that were drawn by the previous government
the people of pelly bay have been waiting a long time for this gymnasium that was going to be connected to the school
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation

your gymnasium is not in those categories but it is within the five year plan
if there s still enough support by the people of pelly bay then it will stay within the capital plan

thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
once the health boards are amalgamated with the government department on april 1 of 2000 we would as a government assume those liabilities and the assets that the boards hold within their current structures

oral questions
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
on april 1 2000 if like you said the deficit would become ours and we re estimating a 20 million dollar deficit isn t it going to create hardship at that time

speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i don t believe that we are dealing with a 20 million dollar deficit
as you know that is one of the figures that has kind of been tossed out there as a potential worst case scenario by my colleague who is not here today
we are hoping to have that work wrapped up in a couple of weeks and that will give us a better idea of some of the options we might put forward as a government

chairperson mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you
at this time we ll go into committee of the whole to discuss bill 2 and 5
i would like to ask what the committee s wish is
would you like to take a brief break before we go ahead
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
chairman it is my understanding that we would get into bill 2 - amendment of the workers compensation act but whenever the committee is ready
thank you
chairperson interpretation
okay everybody agrees
what is the committee s wish
did you want to take a brief break before we go ahead
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman i would just like to go ahead without a break
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
all agreed
nays
thank you
i apologize if you would like to move right into bill 2 then we ll go ahead
we ll open up the floor for debate afterwards
you want to go ahead to the witness table
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr minister
bill 2 is in regards to the wcb
they re in your white binders second page
chairperson interpretation
do you have any opening remarks
we ll proceed
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
the purpose of the amendment of the workers compensation act is to address the problem identified with the section dealing with third party actions in motor vehicle accidents
the difficulty with the section as currently written is that it allows injured workers to sue their own employers and co-workers in motor vehicle related accidents
this goes against the first principle of workers compensation legislation that an injured worker cannot sue his or her own employer
mr chairman the proposed amendment does not affect the ability of workers to be treated fairly
workers will continue to be covered by workers compensation and have access to a series of reviews and appeals if they are not satisfied with the compensation they receive
mr chairman bill 2 is intended to address an unforeseen issue arising from section 12 of the workers compensation act
this amendment will ensure that our act is consistent with the principles of workers compensation across canada
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
did you want one of your staff members to go up there with you at the witness table
hon kelvin ng
yes mr chairman there are two individuals here from workers compensation to appear as witnesses
chairperson interpretation
okay if you would go up please
okay before they go up i would like to ask the members if our lawyer could also sit up at the witness table if it s okay with the members
okay come up and mr minister you sit with the wcb people and our legal advisor
mr minister i would like to ask you if you could introduce the workers compensation board representatives
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
to my right is mr jerry mire president of the workers compensation board
to my left mr michael triggs legal counsel with the workers compensation board
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
welcome to the committee of the whole
we will now open up the floor for discussion on bill 2
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i apologize my back is to you
my question is in regards to the issue that you touched upon regarding an automobile accident
some of the workers have problems
sometimes they might be able to make more money but they have a lot of barriers created by these bills especially in the smaller communities
have you considered this problem that s created in the communities
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister if you would like to respond or if one of the people at the witness table would like to respond to that question
hon kelvin ng
if i understand the question correctly i ll try to answer it
this amendment would not impact on an individuals right to workers compensation benefits as a result of any work related accident that might take place
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
would it be more clear if i say that in the smaller communities only people with licenses can drive taxis and you need a special class if you want to become a taxi driver
is this going to affect that in the smaller communities mr ng
hon kelvin ng
but again that wouldn t it s my understanding that this amendment wouldn t affect that circumstance
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
while we re considering bill 2 we re looking at amendments to bill 2 in regards to the workers compensation act
in respect to transportation accidents arising out of and during workers employment
any further questions
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes thank you for that clarification
i have another question in regards to the smaller communities
there are barely any employment opportunities in the smaller communities and it creates a problem when you re trying to buy insurance
especially for the small businesses
they pay monthly dues on an annual basis or on a monthly basis and they pay out a lot over the year
that is a problem especially for the smaller communities
people who are trying to establish small businesses tend to pay all their revenue to the workers compensation board and nothing comes back to their own business
is there something we can do to alleviate this problem
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr minister ng
hon kelvin ng
he s referring to more general matters in regards to workers compensation premiums assessments and that which are geared towards the exposure
thank you
chairperson
thank you mr minister
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
are we making an amendment to the workers compensation act because the smaller communities are not included
chairperson
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
i give it to mr mire to answer this one
thank you
chairperson
i would like to remind the house and to remind the members that we are following these white binders
i believe you have a copy in front of you
we re following the binders that we have in front of you
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
maybe i m not making myself clear
this act will effect a lot of people out there if we agree to this amendment
like i was saying the smaller communities have employees even in the smaller communities everybody out there works whether it s a smaller community or not
what i m trying to say here is we re taking out a lot of money for the worker s compensation board and i don t know how to make it any clearer but is that going to be covered under this act
chairperson
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr minister are you going to be responding to that
hon kelvin ng
mr minister the honourable member brings up valid points but i guess the points he s bringing up are more in respect to the whole issue of workers compensation board coverage and the workers compensation act
this specific amendment that we re proposing as i indicated in my opening comments deals with the difficulty in the current legislation in allowing individuals to sue their employers or co-workers if they were to be injured
so this is more of a specific amendment versus the whole wcb act i guess and i don t know if that answers the members question it s getting a bit confusing mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
please wait while i go with the names i have
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
just to try to add some focus and clarity to the issue maybe the minister or his staff could give us an example so that the member could better understand what we re doing in reference to this amendment
i think there will be other times where we can discuss in general the concerns that we have about premiums and payments and issues in general about workers compensation
my first question would be relating to other jurisdictions we re looking at changing this
is that fair to say
mr mire
perhaps as an example
chairperson interpretation
one moment please as the chair i would like you to recognize the chair before you make your comments
only after you recognize the chair i ll give you the go-ahead
i apologize i cannot say your name
if you would go ahead please
mr mire
thank you mr chairman
my name is mire
if i may provide an example for the member
as the minister indicated this would be contrary to the principles on which workers compensation operates and that principle is that the employer pays assessments to the board so he can avoid being sued by his workers
in paying those assessments he also protects any other workers who work for him from liability as a result of that accident involving his worker
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mire
i think that s how you pronounce your name
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
that was probably a little more detail than what i was looking for but going back to my original question the issue here is that if somebody were injured in a vehicle would they not be covered by compensation
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr mire
mr mire
if there are injured workers they will always be covered no matter who may be ultimately liable for any harm that was caused to them
chairperson
thank you mr o brien
mr o brien
it s really a duplication by having this in there you re paying twice
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr mire
mr mire
mr chairman yes there is that potential and you re correct in assuming that this legislation would avoid that possibility
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr o brien
mr o brien
one last question if i m not mistaken we changed this made this amendment to the act when we were the gnwt
i think i recall being involved in that for that very reason but now that we re nunavut we have to change it again for this government
how does it relate to other jurisdictions are we the only ones or one of the few that have this double standard in the act
chairperson
thank you mr o brien mr mire if you can respond
mr mire
thank you mr chairman
the way the legislation reads now would make it different from any other jurisdiction in canada
the way we are proposing to amend it would make it similar to a majority of other jurisdictions in canada
not all jurisdictions will have legislation which reads exactly the same as this
but it is safe to say that the smaller jurisdictions in canada will all have legislation similar to what we re asking you to make yours into
thank you
chairperson
thank you mr o brien
mr o brien
mr chairman this is my last question
i agree with this amendment and i ll be supporting it i m just curious i know we inherited the various acts and regulations from the gnwt when we became nunavut
if we did that amendment would be included so why are we doing it again
thank you
chairperson
thank you mr o brien
mr mire
mr mire
the act which you inherited actually the amendment to which the member is referring was passed by the gnwt in november of 1998 and it was that amendment which created the problem
that problem has since been corrected by the gnwt when it passed an amendment the same as this one in september just a month ago
the problem has been corrected in the nwt and it remains for this government to deal with
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
i was going to make a point of order we aren t going to be dealing with the workers compensation act it s huge
this is just an amendment
if you look at the summary i wanted to make a point of order to mr iqaqrialu he was asking questions that are contained in the whole act
if he would like to get into the workers compensation act in full he could look into that and he could also use a private member s bill
this is an amendment to the workers compensation act and mr ng read the summary the purpose
perhaps if we keep on that line we can complete this in no time
thank you
chairperson interpretation
that was just a comment and a point of order
thank you mr arvaluk
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk said what i was going to say
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you for the clarification
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
so now i understand what we re dealing with at this point
i myself don t like the contents of the whole workers compensation act because some of the clauses are a barrier to some of the smaller communities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
is that your question
can one of the people down here respond because he asked the question that in the smaller communities there are many barriers that we face in this act
i think that mr iqaqrialu is asking whether it s going to have an impact on his concerns
can you respond to his concern please

adoption of the inuit employment plan
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker article 23 of the nunavut land claims agreement is a very important article for nunavummiut
it stipulates that the government of nunavut is required to increase inuit participation in the public service to represent the ratio of inuit in the total population of nunavut
mr speaker as a newly formed government we have already made progress but we do realize that we face many challenges in achieving our goal of a representative public service
mr speaker the iep developed by the oic contains a number of strategic initiatives to make it easier for nunavummiut to gain positive employment with the government
such initiatives include working with the minister of culture language elders & youth to develop on the job training and mentoring a nunavut orientation and language skills program and developing nunavummiut in every profession
in closing mr speaker i am confident that the initiatives proposed in the inuit employment plan will have a key role to play in achieving our goal of a representative public service for nunavut

polar bear management
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today to speak on an issue of great importance to our harvesters in nunavut
the responsibility we have in managing two thirds of the world s polar bears
polar bear management is a responsibility we share with the hunters of nunavut and the nunavut wildlife management board
two primary principles by which polar bears are managed in nunavut are conservation and sustainable harvesting
these principles are enshrined in the nunavut land claims agreement and they are principles by which our ancestors ensured we would have polar bears to hunt today
interpretation ends mr speaker the statistics i am quoting from the nunavut wildlife management board are based on information that my department collects from hunters and from scientific research on polar bear populations
the results of these studies are discussed with communities and used along with our inuit qaujimajatuqangit as a basis for making management decisions
interpretation mr speaker the handling of bears during research has raised questions about the impact of such activities on the bears themselves
i take these concerns very seriously and i have directed my department staff to ensure our handling methods are closely monitored during each field session
my department of sustainable development has commissioned an external review of the effects of handling polar bears and the results of this review will be made public as well as my department s responses to it
the memoranda of understanding are now four years old and it is time to start examining their success
where necessary they will be revised to reflect the new information available to us
this is a task that i expect will take several years to review properly
i also want to say while recognizing these memoranda of understanding are in need of complete review these mou s are extremely important for the joint management of polar bears
the memoranda of understanding serve to demonstrate to the rest of the world that nunavut as a whole is committed to the sustainable use of its wildlife resources
but there are concerns about these memoranda of understanding amongst our hunters and i want to say today that these concerns have not gone unheard
interpretation ends mr speaker we also must not forget that many of our bears cross provincial and territorial boundaries and international borders
we cannot effectively manage our polar bear population without co-ordinating our activities with our neighbours
so i have asked department officials to begin pursuing the development of formal management agreements with these jurisdictions
interpretation ends mr speaker i reiterate my commitment to incorporate inuit qaujimajatuqangit into my department s decision making
managing our polar bears in a sustainable manner can only be achieved by using a blend of the best practices of modern science and the extensive knowledge of our hunters
mr speaker it is my privilege and honour to be this government s first minister of sustainable development and to have the opportunity to put in place a management system for polar bears that is made in nunavut by nunavummiut

y2k - government of nunavut is ready
hon jack anawak
thank you mr speaker
as you are aware the millennium is coming in a few months and we all have concerns about the effect of the millennium bug also known as y2k
nunavut emergency services under the department of community government and transportation have been working with the federal provincial and territorial governments since early in 1999
on april 1 terc moved to include nunavut government representatives as well
deputy ministers have assigned staff to ensure each government of nunavut department is represented on terc
each month they meet to discuss their progress on y2k compliance
the federal government along with the provinces and territories have produced several information packages
public information is also available through the internet
website addresses and other detailed information are available through nunavut emergency services in the department of community government and transportation or one of the designated departmental representatives
nunavut is better prepared than many other jurisdictions to deal with any disruptions that may occur due to the millennium bug
due to our isolation nunavut is supplied annually with non-perishable goods and fuel
the power corporation has assured us that there will be no unexpected y2k related power interruptions
nunavut emergency services the rcmp the department of national defence and northwestel have community contingency plans in place or being finalized
the contingency plans include regular time communication checks with each nunavut community to ensure no disruptions occur
although we anticipate no disruptions the territorial emergency response committee will ensure we are ready in the event of any unforeseen problems
i would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of this committee for their hard work and for giving up their new year s eve plans to ensure the safety of other nunavummiut

council of people with disabilities
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am pleased to advise the house today about the council for people with disabilities and the disabilities initiatives taken by our government
the department of culture language elders & youth has been working very hard in support of people with disabilities and we feel that there are several issues that should be brought to your attention
interpretation ends people with disabilities continue to find themselves without equal access
this causes isolation lack of self-esteem and contributes to poverty
people with disabilities want to benefit from the programs and services that government has to offer and want input into how these services can be best delivered
interpretation a council was formed to provide a unified voice for people with disabilities and act as a lobby group for equal access
this council for people with disabilities has also recently applied for society status
there is not a high degree of public awareness in nunavut about people with disabilities
the council for people with disabilities and the department of culture language elders & youth are working together towards a number of goals
the council has provided us with a number of recommendations i would like to mention
interpretation ends these recommendations are to increase awareness and accessibility
these recommendations are that government should work together to provide information education training and employment opportunities for people with disabilities
to ensure access to housing is available for people with disabilities
to develop public awareness programs
to help eliminate barriers that people with disabilities experience in schools work and community life
to make our public buildings and transportation accessible to people with disabilities
to provide government information in multiple formats and languages to ensure the maximum participation of nunavut residents with disabilities
to ensure the provision of technology training and information in multiple formats for participants with disabilities in the nunavut education system and workplace
this will pave the way for ensuring relevant and cost-effective services funding and access for all nunavut residents with disabilities and we will do our best to help in this area

i am happy for the people of the kitikmeot area
i am also glad that we are proposing one time zone but i would like the members of the legislative assembly to reconsider because the people of baffin are going to have a difficult time
we are not opposed to this idea it is just the two hours that i am opposed to

sanikiluaq s opposition to time change
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we don t want to be talking about this same issue forever but i feel the need to say something about the single time zone
mr speaker the community of sanikiluaq that i represent do not want to go on to central time because in the community many of the residents are harvesters
we also have a lot of school children
if we go back by two hours it is going to effect the harvesters the hunters and the students
the people of sanikiluaq are opposed to going back two hours
we are not opposed to the single time zone proposal but there has to be a compromise
what we are proposing is that keewatin stay on the same time kitikmeot go forward and baffin go back one hour
that would be a compromise that would suit everyone for the whole of nunavut

mr mclean

it is with great pleasure that i stand today and speak about the time zone
finally we are going to be truly united in nunavut
rather than having three different times in nunavut we are going to be able to pick up the phones and call our friends in the baffin and in the kitikmeot at the same time
there will be no more confusion for the older people when they want to contact the capital and have to worry about times
so today mr speaker i truly applaud the one time zone for nunavut

they have worked very hard for many years in advancing and teaching inuit traditional skills and learning
i would like to recognise ollie and lizzie ittinuar who have worked extremely hard to date in preserving and promoting the inuit traditional activities and languages and we never seem to give them proper recognition

difference between tenders and rfps
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is a return to an oral question that was asked by hunter tootoo on october 21 1999
i would like to make a reply interpretation ends to define what the difference between a tender and a request for a proposal is
my apologies to the members for not responding verbally at the time the question was asked
i misunderstood the question that was posed by mr tootoo and thought he was looking for a formal legal definition of an rfp or tender
mr speaker i am pleased to advise mr tootoo and all the members of the legislature that a request for proposals is a request for proposed solutions to a defined need or problem
it is not an offer but only contemplates an offer
the receipt of a proposal is not an acceptance and does not result in a contract
on the other hand a call to tender is the beginning of a contract and must result in a contract
when the government tenders they know what they need and are shopping for the best price for the goods or services they require
if any member of the legislative assembly would like further examples or clarification please do not hesitate to contact me and i will be pleased to expand or help in any way

disaster compensation policy
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
over the last year or so we have heard from numerous hunters and trappers about their losses through no fault of their own those who have lost equipment due to acts of god and natural disasters
the effect on these people is devastating because a lot of them don t have secondary incomes
my question today is to the minister responsible
does this government have any kind of disaster relief program to compensate hunters trappers and fishermen for acts of god
ma na uqaqti
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister responsible for ikupiktullirijiit mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation

mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
it is reassuring to hear that
i am sure the honourable minister will bring that forward quite soon
but in this policy will there be a compensation package to replace snowmobiles or boats or motors things like that
will that be looked at and will that be in this compensation package

speaker interpretation
ma na mr mclean

however we do recognize the importance of it and are trying to facilitate expanding the financial services that are available in our communities

i know as i indicated there is an interest and we can follow up with them to see what kind of time lines they would be looking at

dead bowhead whales
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have another question for the minister of sustainable development
as we have heard in the past around the hall beach and igloolik areas there have been bowhead whales killed by killer whales and nobody has been voicing that concern
perhaps if these killer whales were human beings it would be viewed by all the people of the world
i was wondering what you are going to be doing with these whales that have been killed
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister for sustainable development
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i just want to explain that marine mammals are not under the jurisdiction of the nunavut government
the federal government department of fisheries and oceans have that jurisdiction
the information i have received to date is that killer whales have been killing bowhead whales
i can tell you our department has no jurisdiction
speaker
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
perhaps the nunavut government should write a letter making a recommendation to get killer whale numbers reduced
we use those animals for our subsistence and we do not like to see them depleted by another animal

mr speaker my question is to the minister responsible for petroleum products
mr speaker some time ago my colleague from gjoa haven raised an issue about bad gas in their community and the effect it had on their snow machines and other vehicles
mr speaker i use my colleagues example for the reason that if this situation has not been resolved it may effect other communities such as mine

i have a question for the minister of sustainable development in regards to the statement he made on polar bear management

to respond to that question i think we have to have a clear understanding
we are not going to make changes on our own it will be through consulting with the communities
we will include the communities through consultations with the public so that we ll have a better understanding
i would also like to say mr speaker that the wildlife regulations which we inherited from the government of the northwest territories are quite old
they will have an effect on us and we are having a review done mr speaker
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this spring in june i asked a question about the harvesting of male polar bears only which effects our lifestyles and the polar bear species

some of the review i hope will focus on community involvement through the one window approach to program delivery including employment counselling
moving from dependence to self-sufficiency from the government
priorities addressing the social needs of residents of nunavut
and fiscal responsibility of the government budget
all these have to be looked at before we can commit on what changes they will be contemplating and how much they re contemplating increases
because it s a canadian standard we really don t know if in fact it reflects the reality of social requirements in nunavut
all that will be reviewed and in the meantime i have no plans to automatically make cost of living increases until we have reports done by the committee that i proposed this morning this afternoon rather

my question is about aviation fuel
this fuel is available in most communities but pelly bay and repulse bay don t have it available
the reason i m asking this question is because when we were coming from baker lake last spring we chartered a plane going to my riding
we could not land in uqsuqtuq and pelly bay because they did not have aviation fuel
we had problems because although we wanted to land in repulse bay we could not because there is no aviation fuel available there

the health centre has three units
that person might have room there so we could ask this question to the minister responsible for health and social services
the government unit is so old they can t use it at this point and it requires a lot of repairs

for five years our agreement was in place and sometimes we ran into a problems because inuit traditional knowledge was contrary to some of the management plans
the communities would prefer to use their knowledge and their culture and traditions and i was wondering if your department is going to use traditional knowledge

minister responsible for sustainable development mr kilabuk

yes in regards to the question if we look at nunavut if we look at the north south east and west in nunavut we have different populations in nunavut

in the james bay area during the polar bear study the sanikiluaq residents quota was reduced after the polar bears were surveyed
there is a lack of employment and we depend on the polar bear hunts and since they reduced the quota for the community will you be making your quotas using the communities needs

bill 6 - an act to amend the access to information and protection of privacy act
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker honourable members
mr speaker i move seconded by the honourable member for pangnirtung that bill 6 - an act to amend the access to information and protection of privacy act be read for the second time
mr speaker the gnwt passed the access to information and protection to privacy act in 1994
the act came into force on december 31 1996
the act was then inherited by the nunavut government on april 1st of this year
this fall they passed an act to amend the act which amended 10 separate pieces of legislation
mr speaker the government of nunavut feels strongly that this assembly should not just automatically copy what was done in the government of northwest territories
we believe that this assembly and nunavut s access and privacy commissioner should be involved in the process of determining what acts should prevail over the atip act and which should not
mr speaker unfortunately as the act is now written these decisions must be made and amendments enacted before december 31st 1999
bill 6 will extend the december 31st deadline by one year
mr speaker it s for these reasons that our government is asking this assembly to pass bill 6 an act to amend the access to information and protection of privacy act in this session

chairperson interpretation
i apologize i wasn t using my receiver can you please repeat yourself mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the government operations committee dealt with this bill and recommended that we proceed with consideration of the bill in committee of the whole and have the minister and his officials go to the witness table
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
perhaps minister ng would like to go to the witness table or would you prefer to sit on your seat there
hon kelvin ng
perhaps i ll just give the opening comments and then move to the witness table and bring forward the witnesses that are appropriate
thank you
chairperson interpretation go ahead minister ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairman the purpose of the loan authorization act is to facilitate lending to municipalities
it will benefit municipalities which may not have the ability to borrow from commercial lenders
the loan authorization act sets the upper limit for municipal loans for the 1999/2000 fiscal year at 10 million dollars
to date we have committed 5 2 million dollars to two municipalities
iqaluit $5 million dollars for the construction of a new sub-division and clyde river $200 thousand dollars to meet on-going commitments until the fiscal review of that community is completed
mr chairman the government is requesting a loan limit of $10 million dollars to ensure that we may be able to meet the needs that may arise in other municipalities
if requirements do not materialize loans will not be made
loans are advanced only after careful scrutiny by the departments of community governments & transportation and finance and administration
only applications from mayors are recommended to the minister of finance and administration for approval
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister ng
are you in agreement
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
just so you know mr akesuk recommended that the minister and his officials go to the witness table

i apologize the minister s opening comments are done and we are on general comments
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i have a question if that s ok
i would like you to clarify the loan authorization act for me thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
perhaps the minister can re-phrase his opening remarks
hon kelvin ng
mr chairman this loan authorization act is specific it s only to allow the government to lend to municipalities not to direct individuals or businesses under this act
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
at least now i understand
thank you
chairman interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
it states here that you have made a loan to clyde river to meet on-going commitments and here in the inuktitut translation it says for the construction of a new sub-division
when you were reading your presentation you stated it was to meet on-going commitments until the fiscal review of that community is completed
so could you elaborate on that because in the translations in inuktitut it states otherwise
chairperson interpretation
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
james when we were listening to the interpreters it said iqaluit for the construction of new sub-division there s a misunderstanding here now
i apologize
the next speaker is mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
a question to the minister of finance
chairperson interpretation thank you mr nutarak
i have to apologize for the inuktitut document here
for the construction of a new sub-division mr iqaqrialu had a question on that because of the inuktitut document
mr iqaqrialu just wanted to make a point because the translation on the document is missing
i just wanted to make that clear
if you understand now we ll get to mr nutarak s question
perhaps the minister can respond
hon kelvin ng
in respect to mr nutarak s question
this loan authorization act sets a ceiling of 10 million dollars as a maximum amount that government of nunavut could lend at any given time in total for this current fiscal year of 1999/2000 to municipalities
as i indicated in my opening statement if there is no need then the money won t be lent
it s based on specific requests that may come from municipalities and it goes through a formal review process of a committee of officials before it s recommended whether or not to loan funds to municipalities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
sometimes i can hardly see my button here
thank you mr chairman
the remaining 4 8 is left over from the 10 million dollars is the remaining money the 10 thousand 4 8 million dollars already committed prior to march 31
chairperson interpretation
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
no it isn t sorry 200 thousand dollars of that 4 8 million dollars is committed the rest isn t
thank you
chairperson interpretation
are you finished
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
just a few comments mr minister
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
i can t i don t have the information in respect to what their ceiling amount was the gnwt ceiling on their loan authorization act
i can tell you the amounts they advanced last year they advanced 1 million dollars in all to municipalities under their loans
and i can also use an example of 95/96 where they advanced 9 1 million dollars so it fluctuates in different years depending on the needs of municipalities at any given time
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman given our tight financial situation or our almost embarrassing financial situation here in nunavut with the health care and education and housing and so on
how can the minister justify expending ten million dollars for these various projects given the financial bind that we find ourselves in
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman for the record first of all this isn t a grant or contribution this is a loan authorization the money has to come back to the government of nunavut
it s to assist municipalities because of various reasons for their financial needs they may not be able to access commercial lending for whatever circumstance that the application would come forward from municipalities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman what is the time-line or the time-frame for these for example in iqaluit there s 5 million dollars committed
what is the time-frame for this money to be returned to the government of nunavut
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
perhaps the minister would like to respond
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman each loan application includes a repayment schedule that is worked out based on negotiations with the municipality and the recommendations that come from the official that screened each of the applications
in this case it is my understanding because it is a land debenture using the town of iqaluit scenario it s generally because of their capital projects with long repayment periods generally a 20 year time-frame for repayment
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr o brien
i just find it difficult to comprehend that we can t seem to find money for health and in particular housing where we have overcrowding and 700-800 people on a waiting list for homes
but we can find 10 million dollars to loan out and it may not be for the 20 twenty years but i m sure it will be at least 10 years
i m just not sure this is the best use of our money given the fact that we re in a bind financially and this is not a slight on iqaluit or anybody else
i just think that our money could be better spent at this time
if we were in a flush situation where there was a lot of money and we were well established i could see it
but i do have difficulty with this and my question would be how is the minister going to allocate the second 5 million dollars
if he could give some guidelines on how the projects will be selected and whether the regular members will have any input into this selection process
chairperson interpretation
minister
hon kelvin ng
mr chairman i d like to reiterate this isn t an expenditure this is a loan that the government is putting out
there is an big distinction between giving out money like a grant or contribution versus lending out money to the municipalities
mr chairman i m trying to stay away from the broader issue of government of nunavut financing based on the member trying to expound on health needs
he also knows that the minister of housing through the task force is quite actively trying to find some possible solutions make some recommendations on how to proceed in the specific area of housing
again i would say that it has to go through a screening process of officials
there are representatives specifically it has to come forward from community government and transportation which deals primarily with municipalities
finance is involved obviously because of the analysis of the risk and repayment schedules
there s criteria in respect to conformance with the towns and villages act to authorize municipalities to borrow
there s repayment terms that have to be specified
there s assessment as i indicated on the repayment ability of the borrower and the security as well
those issues of security have to be looked at and taken into the evaluation and it has to be approved by debenture bylaws in certain circumstances and the ability of the municipality to provide repayment as well
it was tied specifically to the land development needs of the town of iqaluit because it was growing at such a quick pace because of iqaluit becoming the capital
so land development is an issue that allows for more housing in the capital
it allows more people because of more private development it actually takes some of the pressure off some the government of nunavut needs for staff housing
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr o brien
mr o brien
mr chairman it s not my intent to agitate the minister
if it were 10 million dollars that is not in the pot for example to spend on housing and it s hard not to bring these different issues or areas into the fold but they re there they exist
and again going back to my earlier comment i feel that it could be better spent elsewhere that money s going to be tied up for 10 or 15 or 20 years so it s money we can t spend
you talk about the situation you brought up about iqaluit and the need for the expansion of land development there s certainly many communities that have that similar situation
i question the rationale at this point in time
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
i think it s important to remember that this is available to all municipalities
there have been in fact past municipalities that have borrowed with the gnwt in respect directly to land development
if we required some borrowing for the government of nunavut certainly that can be done
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
i guess i just see this as another form of capital projects that are being given out without going through this assembly without going through the caucus the house and to me it just doesn t seem overly fair
that s all i have to say
thank you
chairperson interpretation
i think that was just a comment
did you want to make a response mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman first of all let me reassure all members of this house that it s not the intent of the government to circumvent any of the processes here
when the legislation came forward as you all know from the government of the northwest territories to nunavut there was an assumption made that the authorization act was one of them
but by the same token we knew that these municipalities required assistance so we made that decision to go ahead recognizing that we would have to bring in the legislation subsequent to that
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
mr chairman in regards to this loan authorization act i would like to approve it because the nunavut government will be helping out the hamlets in the nunavut area
that was just a comment
chairperson interpretation
mr mclean
mr mclean
we realize and i don t want to sound like i m picking on the capital but there s unparalleled economic growth in this community
i can attest to the homeless shelter here and the people that are in it because they can t find affordable housing in iqaluit
that could be for different reasons and i know probably that iqaluit is stretched for dollars to build a subdivision this year
and we all know that iqaluit will probably double in population in the next four to five years
we know that
it s growth it s the capital and there s going to be more pressure put on this government to bring them up to the standards that other capital cities have
and that gets into where we re going next year and the years following
i have no problems with this loan authorization act i think it s a useful tool in communities and i ve lived in them for the last 28 years
and that s happened probably in more cases than enough
then this loan authorization act will come and appease the banks and the municipality gets a debt reduction plan back on line with the help of municipal and community affairs
my reluctance on this one and it s general reluctance and i m not picking on the capital but when does it stop
is there going to be a point where we say no to iqaluit if it s 10 million dollars next year 5 million and 5 million
i know they re paying it back but it s coming out of general coffers and yes you will get it back i m sure you will because there s a vehicle there to get it back
but i think we can utilize that money in different areas and housing seems to be one
and there s nothing wrong with the government guaranteeing a loan for a municipality if we go that far
but my fear is that this monster could get out of control in the next few years and much needed capital dollars will be used on subdivisions and streets and pavement and things like that
that s my fear
i want it to be used where the need is most
and we hear that all the time
put the money where the need is and i m not begrudging iqaluit i think iqaluit s got to grow up and go to the banks and start utilizing them with us guaranteeing them
thank you
chairperson interpretation
minister
hon kelvin ng
mr chairman just to reiterate again this isn t a direct cash expenditure from the perspective of coming out of our operating and maintenance funds
it shows up that you advanced it it s out there as a loan is outstanding which is a receivable
i want to stress that this is a loan
it s all repayable and i can appreciate the members comments about when does it stop
but right now i can t speak about what their future needs are or any municipalities future needs for that matter
we can only deal with what comes to us in this current fiscal year mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
listening to the comments from the members of the legislative assembly i m very envious that they re financially well off i m very envious that they make comments like that
listening to the comments around the table i think that there s something wrong when we hear comments made around the table pointing at communities as mr minister was saying we have to renew this act every year
chairperson interpretation
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman yes the member is right in that i had indicated that this loan authorization act would have to be repeated every year because it s a spending authority requested by the government from the house
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
again i have another question
if we approve this act will the nunavut communities or hamlets be given a copy of this act so they know that there are loans available from the nunavut government
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
i don t think we d necessarily give them a copy of the act but through community government and transportation their staff would deal with the municipalities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
when we were still under the gnwt the department of maca never got that information out to the communities
if we re going to be submitting this to community government and transportation and if that information isn t given out to the communities they won t know that this loan is available
are we going to be getting this information out there so that they ll know there s money available
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
just for further clarification we re discussing bill 1 and we re not going to be getting into the fine details
the question here now is the loan authorization act and sending the information out there is not part of the discussion
i would like to go back to bill 1
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman i understand exactly where you re coming from and i m glad that you made that comment
during my term i know that i ll be a part of reviewing these acts
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
any further comments or questions
i believe that we may not have a quorum
nancy if you could count the members we ll take a ten minute break because we don t have a quorum
>>short recess
chairperson interpretation
we can proceed with our session
mr iqaqrialu do you have any more comments
go ahead
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i just wanted to make another comment
i know that our community has been running in a deficit situation for quite some time now
i especially want to say that when you pay part of your loan or your deficit only part of it your deficit starts to accumulate
on top of your deficit the interest starts building and your deficit starts building up if you don t pay the bill in whole
if the municipalities would prefer to pay for their loan all together perhaps after the bill has been enacted would it be possible for the communities to repay their loan in full if they wanted to
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
so if there is a desire to prepay or pay in advance or accelerate the payments that is certainly something we would be more than happy to accommodate
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i will try and elaborate again
so the interest accumulates when we don t pay for our loan according to the procedure
when the municipality proposes to pay back the loan all at one time it is easier and it is not as dangerous
so perhaps i made myself clear for now
chairperson interpretation
mr minister would you like to respond
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman mr chairman just to advise members that when the government lends out money under this act we charge a lower interest rate than the commercial institutions would
in the case of municipalities to meet whatever needs they have based on specific proposals that they have for loans
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i don t want to be the only one taking the floor and i apologize for having the floor
that is creating the problem for the hamlet council who owe money to financial institutions and also to the government
i hope that is clear
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
i believe there is a response mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
i know exactly where mr iqaqrialu is coming from
when we help the hamlets of course we give out loans to some of the hamlets that was the policy of the government of the nwt
we have to help the communities because they might go bankrupt
we give financial support to the hamlets and the nunavut government and the hamlet councils work together so that they can repay their loan
it would be good if they could keep up with their loan payments but possibly through mismanagement or if there is breakage in their equipment they could very likely come back to the government and ask for another loan
it is good when they have one loan but then there are always unforeseen expenditures that might come up
so we might possibly review their loan again
we want to work closely with the hamlet when we give them a loan but there are unforeseen circumstances that might arise and if that particular community wants another loan because of unforeseen circumstances we will review it again

mr akesuk would like to go onto the next item
bill 4 minister of sustainable development
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we can t hear you very well without the ear aids
chairperson interpretation
would the minister like to make a presentation regarding bill 4 mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
my colleague is having a hard time finding his paper
it is bill 4
my colleague can t find his pages could you wait one minute please
thank you
i am going to be saying the same thing that i said this morning
this is in regards to the legal services board
there is one and they work for nunavut but their present name is the nwt legal services board
the purpose of this bill is to amend the legal services act to provide for a nunavut legal services board to start on april 1 2000
the staffing process for the executive director position is currently underway and once that is done other staff will be hired and the office itself will be set up in gjoa haven
the plan is to have the office staffed and operational prior to april 1 2000
the standing committee on community empowerment and sustainable development made certain recommendations to alter the draft legislation prior to it s introduction to the legislature
i have made those changes to this bill as requested by the standing committee
the standing committee s second recommendation refers to the clause that enables the minister to appoint up to two additional members to the board
the recommendation states that there be up to three additional members instead of two
those are the reasons i didn t make those changes
this bill to amend the legal services act is very important because it is a reflection of our governments commitment to take full responsibility for our affairs
nunavut needs it s own legal services board
finally bill 4 is consistent with our commitment to put in place structures that meet the needs of the people of nunavut
thank you mr chairman
i can move up to the witness table if you would like
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak you can continue and if you have staff that you would like to invite

chairperson interpretation
welcome
i now open the floor for comments or questions
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in your opening statements you said that a lawyer would be appointed on the nomination of the law society of nunavut
my question then on this issue is in regards to inuit qaujimajatuqangit
we have stated that we were going to start implementing inuit qaujimajatuqangit and inuit qaujimajatuqangit is not well known by lawyers
we would like to start implementing inuit qaujimajatuqangit
how are you going to implement inuit qaujimajatuqangit into the legal system
chairperson interpretation
anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
this could be used to start implementing inuit qaujimajatuqangit but we need one lawyer from the nunavut law society to nominate a lawyer to sit on that board
the rest of the board members would be from the communities and they don t necessarily need to be lawyers
they won t be lawyers
this legal services board for example the nwt legal services board has some inuit and a lawyer
there might possibly be four or five board members who would be from the nunavut communities
not necessarily lawyers we would appoint these persons with inuit qaujimajatuqangit in mind
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
questions or comments
if there is nothing further
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i am sure that it is in your opening comments but with the nwt legal services board mr chairman now that the nwt has been divided into two there is now the nwt and nunavut
because we are two territories now i am sure that there will be a reduction in staff
how much reduction will there be
i am sure that there was a lot more staff when they represented the whole nwt but since there was division is there going to be a reduction in the number of staff
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
yes our staff i apologize our staff will stay in nunavut even if we split up on april 1 2000
there s going to be no change in the number

budget update
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
today i have the pleasure of providing the legislative assembly and the people of nunavut with an update on the fiscal position of our government
mr speaker it is critical for nunavut s future that we manage our resources wisely
our fiscal plan recognized the need for the nunavut government to be fiscally responsible and clearly committed to delivering needed services to our people within a balanced budget
i am pleased to inform members that over the past six months many people have worked tirelessly to make nunavut s start successful
this included ensuring our fiscal goals were realized
we set this standard knowing that if we do things well nunavut will have a better future
mr speaker i am pleased to inform the legislative assembly that based on the first six months of operation the goal of a balanced budget for the government of nunavut for fiscal year 1999/2000 will be achieved
overall revenues for 1999/2000 are expected to be 1 77 million dollars higher than at the time of the budget
while our tax system will generate less revenue than we anticipated these reductions will be more than offset by increases in the fiscal transfers from the government of canada
mr speaker total expenditures for 99/2000 are currently expected to be 10 3 million dollars less than originally budgeted
most departments are projecting modest expenditure savings for fiscal year 99/2000
these savings are generally attributed to unfilled positions and associated operating costs such as travel
mr speaker i would also like to note that we face a number of significant expenditure pressures including health board deficits
these pressures are expected to offset the additional revenues the lower departmental operating spending and the balance of our 10 million contingency reserve
we have funded strategic initiatives through this reserve like the nunavut nursing program and the nunavut teachers education program
in closing mr speaker i would like to reiterate our government s commitment to managing our resources wisely
a balanced budget in our first year is a significant contribution for our future
by acting in a responsible manner we will ensure a better future for nunavut

elders in nunavut
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am glad for this opportunity to speak with the members of the house on the very important topic of elders
before i begin i would like to thank our elders for their hard work continuing guidance and contributions of wisdom and knowledge
as the huge responsibility of elders has been given to the department of culture language elders & youth i feel that it is my responsibility to speak to several issues and concerns
interpretation ends in a previous statement to the house i explained how elders are a very special group of people in our inuit society
our culture is a verbal one
we never had a writing system
our knowledge of our language and our culture was passed on through generations of inuit over thousands of years
interpretation our elders are our living history
their knowledge is filled with inuktitut and inuinnaqtun words that are unknown to our younger society
interpretation ends our elders can also guide us in the development of this new government
their wisdom and insight contributes to our understanding of ourselves and our inuit ways
much of their knowledge still needs to be told
the importance of oral tradition and knowledge learned from our elders has directed my department s organization and mandate
our culture and heritage division will support and encourage services for elders
it is through the programs in this division that we will be able to provide funding and assistance for the elders of nunavut
interpretation we have established numerous positions in the organizational structure of our department that will deal specifically with elders concerns and the preservation of their knowledge
we have just received approval of our organizational chart and are now able to hire the senior advisor for elders and an ethnologist
the senior advisor for elders will be able to research the needs of the elders in the communities and develop strategies for addressing their needs
interpretation ends the ethnologist will work to preserve oral tradition record oral history and support the senior advisor in the development of programs and services for elders
there will also be an inuit qaujimajatuqangit co-ordinator who will work with the senior advisor for elders and the ethnologists
they will work towards the practical application of our elders knowledge in the government
i want to stress that we are working very hard to establish our department and are making elders our priority
we have begun the process of gathering and recording inuit qaujimajatuqangit
we have attended elders conferences to listen to the concerns and direction of our elders
we have started consulting elders on the development of our department and the government as a whole
we know the knowledge of the elders is a valuable asset and must be treated as such in policy development and program implementation
we know that we must bridge the gap between the past present and future by continuing our initiatives in co-ordinating youth and elders activities
we know that elders have many special needs
in addition to working with them we must also provide them with support
we must continue to ensure their honoured place in our society
because we value cherish and respect our elders we are working to include them in all of the initiatives of our department
we would like to encourage other departments in the government to consider ways they could do the same and to co-ordinate these efforts with our government s inuit qaujimajatuqangit initiatives
again mr speaker i would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak on our commitment to the elders of nunavut
thank you mr speaker

millennium scholarship
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
today i will finally speak in english and tomorrow i will speak french
interpretation ends it is with pleasure that i share this scholarship information with members
i will sign a 10 year agreement with the canadian millennium scholarship foundation representing some 2 3 million dollars in additional funds for student financial assistance
the agreement between the government of nunavut and the foundation creates two classes of awards
general awards and exceptional merit awards
approximately 76 general awards will be given each year to nunavut residents representing more than 228 thousand dollars a year
this corresponds to nunavut s share of the canadian population the basis on which the foundation negotiated all agreements across canada
general awards will have a value of 3 thousand dollars
all nunavut students who apply for financial assistance under the canada and nunavut student loans program for the academic year 1999/2000 will automatically be considered for the foundation s general award
the first nunavut general awards will be distributed by our government in early 2000
the agreement also provides for the creation of three exceptional merit awards to be given each year to nunavut students
exceptional merit awards like the general awards are grants
these awards will vary from 3 thousand to 9 thousand dollars and will be available to nunavut students entering post-secondary education for the first time
these awards will be given for the first time in the fall of 2000 and the foundation together with my department will develop criteria for an equitable and efficient method for identifying recipients for the exceptional merit award
if you have any questions i would invite you to contact the executive director of our scholarship committee luke issaluk at 867-857-3050 or the chairperson jean cooper 867-975-5600

nunavut sealing strategy
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
early in the life of this government and in the early days of my position as minister of sustainable development i accepted an invitation to the montreal fur and fashion show
this show was a great education for me on the vast market there is for fur fashion in this world
it was also an opportunity for me to examine the issues that we face in nunavut in rebuilding a market for our seal products especially
from that day forward mr speaker i resolved to dedicate my energy on this issue to implementing a nunavut sealing strategy
mr speaker i want to advise the members today that the first phase of the nunavut sealing strategy is nearing completion and has involved three key elements
mr speaker this video will speak to one of this governments core bathurst principles our self-reliance
finally mr speaker i will also be releasing at the time nunavut s first manual which will be distributed to every sealing community in nunavut to assist in improving the quality and price of skins in the marketplace
mr speaker i believe nunavummiut expect this government to focus on all aspects of our economy including the longest surviving and the most sustainable economy our seal hunt
it is my commitment today that in the coming days i will do my very best to honour this expectation

corrections planning committee report
hon jack anawak interpretation
i did this for a number of reasons
first we know that we have serious deficiencies in terms of our institutional facilities and our ability to provide adequate programming for our offenders
second we recognize the serious need to have many offenders treated and healed in their communities rather than in jail in iqaluit
we needed a realistic assessment of the situation and recommendations that would work therefore i appointed a number of individuals from the communities to the committee
the committee is chaired by rebecca williams assistant deputy minister of justice
i am pleased to report that the corrections planning committee has submitted it s final report to me
i believe that the committee has done an excellent job of reviewing the state of corrections in nunavut
they have clearly assessed the problems and have provided a set of recommendations that should have significant impacts on improving our justice system
also their recommendations are aimed at ensuring adequate correctional facilities with effective programming as well as involving the communities in helping offenders to heal and re-integrate to the communities
i would like to point out that the corrections planning committee has been consistent with the principles of inuit qaujimajatuqangit
the committee members were selected from the communities and so reflect the interests of those communities
the recommendations reflect the need to handle these issues in a way that is relevant to the needs and aspirations of our residents
i am providing members with copies of the report and i intend to review it more thoroughly in the coming weeks
i plan to have further statements for the next sitting of the legislature
in the meantime i would be grateful for any comments or suggestions that members might have to give me

sanikiluaq elder s advice to mlas
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
when we invited our elders for the official opening of this house the elder that i invited from my community wanted to give some advice to the members of the legislative assembly
he gave me a message he wanted to relay to the members and he talked about the traditional ways he had learned
that elder stated and in no way am i pointing to anybody that he did not really like to hear about our leaders having problems with alcohol or for criminal actions
he has heard about members of the previous legislative assemblies having problems and he does not want to see this present legislature have any problems like that

opposition to time zone
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in regards to the single time zone that is being proposed
i am going to do the best i can to let you know of the strong opposition from my community and the other baffin communities that are opposed to this proposal
it is going to take a while for us to get used to the new time zone and at 2 o clock we will be going back two hours
i don t know whether we are going to have to stay up for an extra two hours or i don t know what s going to happen
>>laughter
sure it may be very funny it might be amusing
i am concerned about the people of the baffin region
there is a allot of us in the baffin region and if we are going to go ahead with this proposal i am going to do the best i can to convince members otherwise
believe me this is very important to me i feel very strongly about this
i want you to know that i am going to work very hard on it my problem is that the baffin region will have to go two hours and the other regions one
i know that it is going to be good for the people of the keewatin region it is not going to effect them and the kitikmeot region will not be effected as much
it is going to be the people of the baffin region most effected
i would like you to consider compromising and think about the population of the baffin region
even if you combine both the kitikmeot and the keewatin populations the baffin region total population will always be more
if i lose on this one if the change goes ahead i will not give up because i know very many people in baffin region and we have the largest population in nunavut i am going to keep fighting
those ministers laughing across me right now will stop laughing i assure you

oral questions
question 74 - 1 3
cigarette smoking
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti mr speaker
it is with great delight today that i stand up and ask a question to the member responsible for smoking
he gave us an interesting statistic last week in our committee meetings that said 93% of teenage girls in nunavut smoke
when i heard that statistic i was appalled totally appalled that the statistics up here seem to be more than the national average
but in that statistic i was just reflecting back i have not seen one poster in my community on anti-smoking
i wonder if the minister responsible has got any kind of plan to implement an anti-smoking plan in nunavut and more so combine it where it is in the schools also
ma na
speaker interpretation
ma na mr mclean
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the member brings up a very serious and very important topic
here in nunavut we have the highest average per capita of smokers in the country
smoking related diseases respiratory diseases are highly preventable if we could stem the tide of smoking
indeed many of the members of this house including myself suffer from that affliction and it is a very difficult habit to break although many of us have tried and are in the process of trying to quit
in general mr speaker to answer the member s question smoking and anti-smoking campaigns are normally run through our regional health boards
they target the priorities for public information and then they deliver the messages out to the public
i have had a chance to review that and our deputy minister and our health people are looking at it and hopefully we will be able to bring something like that forward in nunavut
thank you mr speaker

question 75 - 1 3
health boarding homes
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have a question for the minister of health and social services in regards to the patients who go down to ottawa for medical services
the other day we heard on the radio some of the patients went down there and they were having problems with patients and escorts who went down
they are not welcomed in that facility rotel and especially the rotel is being heavily used by the people of the baffin region
the patients who go down there and the escorts are they going to be put down by this rotel that we use
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
because it isn t acceptable
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
supplementary mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
since we pay per diems through the budget for these facilities the federal government gives us money to pay for accommodations meals and other incidentals the patients who stay in these facilities have to be treated properly
because when we pay for services we expect them to be treated properly
are these monies being used properly for what they were intended
if they are not then we will have to find some other facility for our patients and our escorts because of that money
can you do that as the minister of health and social services
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if you would bear with me i think that at this time we should probably explain the situation and the logistics around the running of the boarding home
in the baffin region mr speaker as you are acutely aware and the members of this house the baffin regional health and social services board transferred services from montreal to ottawa
so under ottawa we have a group called the ohsni which is the ottawa health services incorporated network
they facilitate our patients coming from the baffin region of nunavut to ottawa
in montreal mr speaker as many of the members of this house remember we used to have baffin house which was owned by the government which housed our clients and our patients there
in ottawa mr speaker we did not have a baffin house of course because we just transferred the services
in ottawa there is a facility called the rotel
the rotel is run by the ohsni group
the rotel is on the ground in ottawa and services patients who had to leave from different parts of ontario not just from nunavut
if you are living in smiths falls ontario you have to go to ottawa for the hospital and you have an opportunity to stay at the rotel
when the baffin regional health & social services board mr speaker put this contract in place they signed it with the rotel because they were on the ground and they were facilitating clients
over the past two years we have had some concerns with the rotel indeed in my own family we have some serious situations with patients staying there
so we are acutely aware of those problems mr speaker
but there is a contract in place for the next year and a half between the rotel and the baffin regional health & social services board
that contract mr speaker on march 31st 2000 will be assumed by us the government of nunavut
under the direction of the premier paul okalik and myself as the minister of health and social services we are acutely aware of some of the concerns that the members is bringing forward
indeed we have had letters on them and we are looking into that contract right now
but it is a legitimate contract for the rotel and i as a minister in this government don t want to put ourselves in the position where we walk in and cancel the contract
i reiterate that this government will not sit idly by if people our patients our constituents the residents of nunavut are being ill treated at one of the boarding homes
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
third supplementary mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am not really sure if there was ill treatment of that patient but i have heard this through the media cbc that the escorts when they have alcohol problems are not allowed to go into this boarding home
how are we going to rectify this situation
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
in that context mr speaker about two weeks ago i was in winnipeg for the re-opening of the new boarding home there
that boarding home mr speaker has put in a sobriety clause that anyone who has liquor on their breath even on their breath will not go through the door
mr speaker even when i was there a patient had written a letter who had to go to the boarding home in winnipeg on a regular basis how they hadn t felt safe because of that
i say to you mr speaker that our government if we have people coming into boarding homes because people go to ottawa and are referred there for medical services because they are ill
mr speaker that is not acceptable
the model that is being used in winnipeg is a good model and i endorse it
i say to you mr speaker that in some cases some people don t want to talk about these types of situations but i say we deal with them
if you are going down for chemotherapy or radiation therapy to ottawa you deserve to feel safe and be escorted by someone who is sober
we are not going to sit around as a government mr speaker and have our patients put in jeopardy by drunken escorts i can guarantee you that right now sir
thank you
>>applause
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
your final supplementary mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we value life and when the escorts go down there they are still human beings and they are still alive but they cannot even get into the boarding home
if somebody committed suicide we can no longer do anything about it
but a person who has abused alcohol who is drunk they are human beings they are still human beings
rather than making that person look bad is that going to be your normal practice now because this has an impact on our lives
as the minister are you saying that you don t like the people who drink
they are still at the level of human beings there is opportunity for them to get healed
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu

question 76 - 1 3
budget
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister of finance in regards to the budget update that he gave earlier this afternoon
mr speaker in his statement he indicated that we were experiencing a decrease in revenue about 5 7 million dollars
could the minister give some detail as to what areas this revenue is being lost
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minster of finance
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker there have been some decreases in personal income tax
taxes the collection rates were lower than expected also there has been some reduction in the revenue projections for corporate income taxes as well as the personal income taxes
there is also other areas of taxation fuel taxes as well that are coming in lower than expected and those are some of the main areas for the causes of reductions in revenues
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr ng
oral questions mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker also in the minister s update he indicated that we expected not to spend around 10 3 million dollars less than was originally projected
i believe he indicated that this was partly due to the hirings that have not taken place to this point
can the minister say whether the amount of 10 million dollars whether that represents 60 70 or 80% of the budget for hiring and associated costs
in other words how much of this 10 million dollars is associated with the decrease in hiring
speaker interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the 10 3 million dollars anticipated as amounts not being spent by all the departments is inclusive of all their expenditures including the wages and salaries the honourable member is referring to
if you want to put it in perspective though the government of nunavut salaries and benefits totals approximately 90 million dollars budgetary wise out of our 600 million dollars
so if you put it in that perspective we are talking about 15% of the government s budget in wages and salaries
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker can the minister confirm that when we negotiated the formula financing agreement that my understanding is that included all of the positions and associated costs for the hirings that we were expecting
speaker interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
well mr speaker it is hard for me to answer that question
i wasn t involved directly in the negotiations for the formula financing
as you know the office of the interim commissioner government of the nwt nti were at the table in that respect
speaker interpretation
thank you mr ng
supplementary mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it is my understanding that the minister and his staff indicated that we were at approximately 58 to 60% capacity in our hiring
that would leave just in general terms 40% of the staff not hired yet which i assume would also be the associated cost with the staff as far as hiring and benefits and so on
i just find it difficult to understand that with 40% not being hired how that could only equate to a 10 million dollar saving
actually it is less than 10 million dollars because you indicated there were other areas that there were savings in
i am wondering if the minister could explain in more detail as to what that actually represents
thank you
speaker interpretation

hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i actually think it is quite simple to explain
of course when i had these numbers i asked the same questions of my officials and what the rationale would be
if you used the government of nunavut 53% one has to realize that is 53% staffing of the permanent positions that were budgeted that we approved in this house
but that does not take into consideration mr speaker the casual staffing the contracting back the consultants that are hired in the interim to address shortfalls in the staffing levels
in order to continue to provide services when we don t have all the permanent staffing on hand that s how the departments are dealing with the provision of services
that s primarily the main reason

question 77 - 1 3
public consultations
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the premier the government leader
when we first got elected we stated to the people of nunavut that we would be closer to them and that we would be open and transparent
is this government going to be making decisions and making regulations prior to consulting with the people of nunavut
thank you mr speaker

mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
i don t think you understand me
i ll use an example because one single time zone is very important to us
prior to this decision being given to the people of nunavut you did not consult with the communities as to how the single time zone would be dealt with
you did not get input or consult with the people of nunavut so that s why i had asked you if you re going to be doing this
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker we had consensus on april 1st and there was agreement in the association of municipalities agm to set up one time zone for nunavut
we are implementing that today
it s just going to be one hour here for the baffin region
speaker interpretation
before i recognize anyone i would like to let you know that this should be dealt with at the committee of the whole
i don t believe that we should deal with it during oral questions

question 78 - 1 3
outpost camps for offenders
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have a question for the minister of justice
i know of a people from nunavut who have been just put into jail but i also know that there s outpost camps where they can bring young offenders who have not committed indictable offences
how do you go about making a proposal to set up a camp that would be used for youth who have committed crimes
thank you
speaker
thank you mr irqittuq
minister responsible for justice mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
i would like to thank you
are you talking about getting assistance for building such facilities or what were you asking for specifically
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you
if you could make a supplementary comment or rephrase your question mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you
thank you
hon jack anawak interpretation
i apologize
some of the communities are starting to establish camps to take in clients from the correctional centres
any community whether they be small or large could take on these youth and that s being established in some of the nunavut communities
if you would like to get further information you could call the department of justice or go through the justice committees that are established in some of the communities
you could ask for information from these departments
the department of justice is more than willing to see more camps set up for the youth
speaker
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker with that in mind i have had some people approach me and said that there were previous camp owners who could get assistance for some of their expenditures like for travel costs
is there any financial assistance or has there been a decrease in the amount that could have been used for the camps
speaker
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
anyone who would like to set up a camp to take out young people and who want to have clients in their camps the criteria is still the same
we could look into it but what we do is we give them financial assistance to help them with their transportation food and so on
speaker
thank you

mr irqittuq interpretation

so if one of the youth would like to use one of these outpost camp facilities who would they direct their request to
either myself or whose department
speaker

you could either get help from the department of justice or if they want to they could call my office directly

question 79 - 1 3
staff issues with decentralization
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to ask a question to dpw
i have heard that the department is going to be moving up to pond inlet
i was talking to one of the employees who lives in iqaluit and doesn t want to go to pond inlet because the department is moving up there
what s going to happen
there are some people who do not want to move from their place of residence to another community because their department s moving
what happens if there are some vacant positions because the employees don t go up
would you have training programs available for local people in pond inlet so that these positions could be filled
thank you mr speaker
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the member has been concerned about some of the employees not wanting to move to pond inlet
my deputy minister and i will have to meet with the hamlet in pond inlet so that we could discuss the possibility of setting up a training program or sending someone from pond inlet down here for further training
these are the plans we have in place

question 80 - 1 3
project surname
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
it gets tiring after sitting for quite some time but mr speaker a few days ago under member s statements i made a statement that our surnames and birth dates are not properly recorded or spelled
mr speaker i have a question directed to the premier
so i m encouraging you to make changes
how much work would it require
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
mr okalik
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes i know that a bit myself and we have tried to give you support and when you try to make changes to the name it tends to go through a lot of procedures like through the court system
especially when the elders want to make changes to their names the way they re spelled
perhaps i could get the law reform committee to look into this issue too and i could also include that
i have urged the members of the legislative assembly asking them what kind of issues they want to be looked at by the law reform committee
if you want this to be a priority i could do this
speaker interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you for your response
prior to our government being established our previous government of the nwt had initiated this
it was territory wide including the nunavut area
the gnwt had initiated a project called operation surname and i know that it costs money to do it
since it was gnwt who made all those mistakes why should the nunavut government have to pay for all those mistakes
so i would like you to consider this carefully
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you
mr okalik
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you
first of all it was not by the gnwt it was initiated by the federal government
the project surname was initiated for anybody who would like to change their names or change the spelling
it has to go through the court system and we had inherited this act
therefore i could ask the law reform committee to review this so that it will make it easier for nunavut residents to make changes
thank you

question 81 - 1 3
kimmirut s water reservoir
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct my question to the minister of public works
i received an urgent letter from kimmirut because their reservoir is quite far and they have a pipeline going into the community
i would like to know since there was a study done what has been done to date
we haven t received the results to date
could you let me know what the status is now on this issue
thank you
speaker
minister responsible for public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we can only start working on it if we get direction from the department of cg&t
i can talk about the budget portion of it but it was in the b list
as you know we deal with urgent situations where there s safety health and so on
we first have to get money from mr anawak s department before we can do anything about it because my department is just to do public work
mr anawak probably knows how to respond to your question better because he s the one with the money

question 82 - 1 3
assistance to clyde river for power costs
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have a question for the ntpc
the equipment has arrived in our community and we know that the community of clyde river is in a deficit situation
we re going to be paying 40% of that
what kind of assistance can we get from the nunavut government in regards to paying for that equipment
speaker
thank you
mr picco minister responsible for ntpc
mr picco
thank you mr speaker
i guess i should start with thanking the member for his question
as you know mr speaker earlier this summer i had the opportunity to visit clyde river with the member
i met with the hamlet and the mayor to discuss the construction of the new generating station in the community of clyde river
now let me back up just a little bit to explain the situation mr speaker
we need to be able to provide power electrical power to clyde
in partnership with the people of clyde and the hamlet we ve been able to facilitate some employment opportunities with infrastructure so there are some good points to this
their costs will be covered for that
mr speaker we have to make it very clear that the increase in rate will not occur before a hearing is held and we re not looking at that happening for another 15 or 16 months
in the mean time as a government and as a minister for the power corporation ntpc officials having briefed my cabinet colleagues we re trying to look at a process in place so that we can negate
mr speaker the work here is to negate any extraordinary or enormous amount of rate increases for the people of clyde river
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i m sure that there s going to be annual increases right up to the 40% mark
i understand the reasoning behind it
even if that s the case we will get effected one way or another because of course we re paying out of our pocket for the electrical bill
the gradual increase over the years will effect us residents
have you done a review on how this could be implemented
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mr iqaqrialu
interpretation ends minister responsible for ntpc mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i ll try to be concise and try to articulate that the rate impact on the community of clyde for our best estimates right now could be and the operative word here is could be 33-40%
i think that s important to note
thank you mr o brien for your support over there
you look like a thespian
thank you mr speaker
so the community of clyde river no increase will occur before a public utilities board application happens
then we would have an opportunity to have intervenor status on that application and as a government we realize that a 33 - 40 % increase is not acceptable
what we re trying to do right now mr speaker as a government is look at the whole operation of the nunavut power corporation
we re trying to find out exactly should we maintain the same relationship right now with the ntpc
should we look at outsourcing somewhere supply or indeed should we set up a nunavut power corporation
and those issues and decisions they make over the coming weeks we can then reflect better for the people of clyde on this situation with the rate increase on the community infrastructure and on the new power plant
but in any case it s several months down the road and before that occurs mr speaker the people of clyde river will have an opportunity to review and have a look at that
as you know mr speaker the biggest users of power in the communities is the government
thank you mr speaker

community freezer repairs mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
back in 1982 the gnwt built a community freezer in the community of baker lake to the great delight of the residents of baker lake
in a community like baker lake there are herds of caribou that go by and people take the opportunity to stockpile fresh meat
the community freezer was a big boon to the community for the last fifteen or sixteen years
this spring the four compressors due to no lack of maintenance or anything finally wore out in the middle of june and broke down
unfortunately there was close to 40 or 50 thousand pounds of country food in there that the people in my community depended on
the hamlet wrote to the superintendent and i assumed that he passed it on to the minister about us having to throw away 40 thousands pounds of country food
that really hurt the community
to date i haven t heard an answer back or the community hasn t heard back if they are going to replace the compressors on that freezer
so my question is to the minister of community government does he have plans for next year to replace the compressors on that community freezer

mr speaker i have a response to a petition tabled by the honourable donald havioyak on october 25th on nunavut liquor permits
i am pleased to acknowledge the petition tabled in the assembly by the mla for kugluktuk on behalf of his constituents concerning the use of nunavut liquor import permits
the petition is requesting that the use of nunavut liquor import permits be suspended for the importing of liquor products from the nwt through the yellowknife liquor store
mr speaker on april 1st 1999 a nunavut liquor permit became necessary to obtain liquor from the yellowknife store because the yellowknife store is now outside the government of nunavut s jurisdiction
i agree that this situation has disrupted the usual method that eligible citizens have used to acquire liquor products
i have asked the recently appointed nunavut liquor licensing board to provide me with advice as to how best to deal with this matter and other issues regarding the liquor act

ajauqtiit standing committee on the appointment of languages commissioner
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have the honour of presenting the report on the appointment of the languages commissioner of nunavut
this report was prepared by the standing committee of ajauqtiit after we conducted a thorough selection process to identify the most appropriate candidate for this important public office
as the report states our standing committee worked very hard to make sure that our selection process was thorough and unbiased
a subcommittee of three of our members conducted the interviews and selection process for the languages commissioner which included hunter tootoo the chair myself co-chairperson and david iqaqrialu
members of our committee and subcommittee met thirteen times on the matter of the languages commissioner over the last two months we received twelve applications from people across nunavut for this position
we conducted in person interviews with five candidates reviewed their written answers to questions and evaluated their experience and education as outlined on their resumes
we also reviewed information from three references for the final candidate
it was a very difficult decision for the members because all of the candidates are very committed people and they were all interested in the position and they all have many skills and ideas to bring to the position
we thank them all for applying
nevertheless we had to choose one name to recommend to the members of the legislative assembly
the languages commissioner of nunavut must have many qualities
above all they must be a leader in the inuit tradition able to hold the respect and confidence of all inuit elders and youth as well as french and english speaking residents of nunavut
we believe that eva qamaniq arreak has these qualities
she will do her job in the inuit way
she will make us proud as a representative of nunavummiut in meetings with other languages commissioners across canada and elsewhere
eva understands the challenges facing the government of nunavut and the need for a concerted effort on language issues if the languages of our fathers are to flourish in the future
we are confident that with the support of the members of the legislative assembly her colleagues in these positions elsewhere in canada and her staff eva qamaniq arreak will do an outstanding job as languages commissioner of nunavut
thank you mr speaker at the appropriate time i will give notice of motion to appoint the languages commissioner

whereas section 18 1 of the official languages act permits the appointment of a language commissioner by the commissioner of nunavut after the approval of the appointment by a resolution of the legislative assembly

and
whereas the office of the languages commissioner is vacant
and
whereas the legislative assembly is of the opinion that the appointment of the languages commissioner should now be made

as you know the business incentive policy forms the backbone of the government and we would like to hear from all people and we will be working with nunavut tunngavik incorporated nunavut businesses and inuit firms
as i have stated before if we are going to be developing in nunavut and if we are going to be developing small businesses we have to initiate this business incentive policy
mr chairman our timeline is to review this policy as a final made-in-nunavut business incentive policy which needs to be in place for the next contracting season
it is my hope that a final draft of this policy will be ready for public review by the early new year or be completed by sometime in february or march 2000

thank you mr chairman

thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you very much for your response because for the small businesses that are just starting off the department of sustainable development is responsible for that
i was getting confused when you started talking about larger businesses and smaller businesses
will you be giving support to smaller businesses that want to be initiated
chairperson interpretation
thank you uriash
madame minister
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the department of sustainable development has a program for small businesses that want to be initiated but we are public works
thank you
mr puqiqnak interpretation
i have another question
now that you will be working on the policy for nunavut made in nunavut prior to the drafting of the policy in my constituency businesses are way behind the other regions
you mentioned that this new policy could be introduced by march 2000
in my community there are small businesses that require a lot of assistance
do you have any plans to get these small businesses up to par with the rest of the businesses
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you uriash
madame minister either one of you can respond to his question
hon manitok thompson interpretation
at this point in time the policy was inherited from the gnwt
this policy called the business incentive policy in english was used to help small businesses and that s what we have inherited and we will use it to prioritize nunavut businesses
we cannot operate without any policies so that s why we are using the old policy

mr puqiqnak interpretation
short comment
thank you madame minister
i would like a response about whether this can be implemented before march 2000
is it possible
chairperson interpretation
i believe that we have to stick to the subject here
we re getting out of line
what we understood was that we would stay on the subject here
if you could direct your question to the minister s statement
i d like to keep it in line
you could rephrase your question
mr puqiqnak interpretation
i think i ll make another comment later
chairperson interpretation

thank you mr chair
our proposal as a department to cabinet is that we have four from nti and four from gn but there can certainly be a motion put forward if they want someone else on this body
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you madame minister
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairperson
with all due respect to nti why would it be necessary to have four representatives from nti
can i have some rationale for that proposal
chairperson interpretation
thank you
madame minister if you would like to respond please
hon manitok thompson
mr chair that s our proposal to cabinet and article 24 is from nti

chairperson interpretation
mr o brien

just a comment
i will be making a motion for the minister to consider putting a name forward from the keewatin chamber of commerce for consideration on this review committee
i think that s only reasonable and fair
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
did you want to make a response madame minister
hon manitok thompson
in my statement i said that this working group will seek input from and consult with all members of the legislative assembly representatives of the communities the public business leaders and interested groups so everybody will be consulted
the group will be also consulting with the keewatin chamber of commerce
thank you mr chair
chairperson interpretation
thank you madame minister
would you like to make further comments
mr o brien
just for clarification purposes the minister said that she cannot let us know right now who the individuals are that are going to be on this committee
is that because it has not been approved by your caucus by cabinet
is that my understanding
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
madame minister or any one of the staff members
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chair
as i said i have a proposal to bring forward to cabinet and because we have been so busy we have not gotten to that yet

thank you mr chair
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chair
minister i m just trying to get it clear in my mind
are you saying that cabinet will make the decision on who is approved for this review committee or are you making this decision as the minister for your department
who is making the decision as to who will serve on this committee
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
madame minister
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chair
at this time i just know the numbers
i don t have specific names
for my department we have john purdy who is here right now theresa chandler terry audla and barry cornthwaite
that s from my department and the proposal is for four other people from nti
that s our proposal thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien
there s other people who might want to ask questions
go ahead please
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
my last question again to the minister
so i would ask the minister if she would reconsider her proposal and include one of these names or companies
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
i believe that there has to be equal representation from all of nunavut and there has to be equal representation
please keep in mind that when you are going to be asking questions
madame minister
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chair
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you madame minister
mr mclean i believe you have a question go ahead
mr mclean thank you david
if i stray off the minister s statement somebody will bring me back to it before i start i want to give you a little history lesson
the business incentive policy that the government of the northwest territories enacted was developed by the keewatin chamber of commerce for the northwest territories
i have a problem no offence to bureaucrats they re all hardworking and we need them i see that
what worries me is that the business incentive policy was a good document but it was written in 1983 and 1984 and times have changed where article 24 has come along
the business incentive policy of today does not reflect article 24 of the land claims agreement
it should and i agree with it because there is a large misunderstanding amongst the populace that article 24 and the business incentive policy are separate
but how do you enact them in government contracts
that is a tough question to ask and it s also going to be harder to answer
i like the idea of community consultations
so if you take a tour of communities discussing the business incentive policy you re going to hear all kinds of different ideas on what article 24 and the business incentive policy are
just a short question and mr chairman i want to ask some more questions
is the government going to integrate the business incentive policy and article 24 together in all contracting procedures is that what the quest of this rewriting is
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
madame minister if you would like to respond
hon manitok thompson
everybody is nodding on this side so i m nodding too
yes
thanks
mr mclean
good
that s one of the questions that i ve been wanting to ask for a long time
that s why the business incentive policy was enacted to protect northern businesses and encourage them to grow
is that the goal of the business incentive policy that s going to be rewritten
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
madame minister
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chair
that side is also nodding so yes
we re saying yes too many times glen i mean mr mclean but yes
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson is at the witness table and questions could be asked from any one of the members here
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na

mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
on article 24 i had no kind of direction and we do have many questions to ask i just want to i know that it states april 1 2000

thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
madame minister if you would like to respond
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr chairman
i ll let him answer this
chairperson interpretation
the floor s open
mr bain
when the business incentive policy was brought into force within the nunavut government it was only approved for 12 months and was set to expire april 1 2000
we re hoping to get a new policy in place so there s no confusion with contractors for the next contracting season
so as early we can get that done with the co-operation of the standing committee and the public and what not the less confusion out there for the business community especially with a new policy coming in to place
nukarmiik

right now our premier is at the witness table
so start now please
thank you
hon paul okalik interpretation
can i invite my official kimberly baine
i will speak in english
i would also like to thank the members of this committee for allowing me this opportunity to go into details about bill 6 an act to amend the access to information and protection of privacy act
i ll first provide members with an overview of the effected legislation and then the rationale for the proposed amendment
members can then ask detailed questions of myself and my staff
the gnwt passed the access to information and protection of privacy act in 1994
the act came into force on december 31 1996
this allowed the nwt government two years to prepare for the requirements for compliance under the new legislation
the act was then inherited by the nunavut government on april 1 of this year
the act balances the peoples rights to privacy with the publics right to access information held by government
the act restricts what types of personal information the government can collect about nunavummiut and once collected what the government can do with that information
the act also provides mechanisms for nunavummiut to request information held by government and clearly determines what information government must release and what information must be kept confidential
similar access and privacy regimes are legislated in every other jurisdiction in canada
under the act nunavummiut can be assured that their privacy will be upheld by the nunavut government and that they can access information held by government as provided for in the legislation
when the gnwt passed this act in 1994 they included a provision under section 4 which made privacy clauses in other acts prevail over the access to information and protection of privacy act until december 31 1999
on december 31 of this year section 4 clause 1 ends and section 4 clause 2 comes into effect
clause 2 states that the access to information and protection of privacy act will prevail over all other acts unless specific amendments are made to state otherwise
this allowed the gnwt legislature to consider all other privacy clauses in other legislation and determine if they are inconsistent with the access to information and protection of privacy act
and if they were inconsistent to decide which one should prevail
the gnwt passed an act to amend the access to information and the protection of privacy act this fall
the act amended ten acts to reconcile the differences in the privacy and access rules between those acts and the access to information and protection of privacy act
the gnwt took three years to determine which acts required changes to the access to information and protection of privacy act
we believe that the assembly and the nunavut access and privacy commissioner who will be appointed by the assembly should be involved in these decisions
unfortunately as the act is now written these decisions must be made and the amendment enacted before december 31 1999
this does not give the public the right of access and the privacy commissioner or members of this assembly time to consider the matter
mr chairman it is for these reasons that our government is asking the assembly to pass bill 6 an act to amend the access to information and protection of privacy act in this session
bill 6 extends the december 31 deadline by one year
mr chairman one year is not a long time to undertake the legal and policy work needed to make the necessary amendments
however mr chairman with the assistance of the new commissioner and with the input of the assembly and with the standing committees we believe that we can meet the december 31 2000 deadline
what we are proposing is to leave all legislation as it is today for a maximum of one year
mr chairman i feel strongly that any changes made to peoples rights to access government information or the right to privacy of personal information must be carefully and fully considered by this assembly before they are put into effect
with that i wish to thank the members for allowing me to say a few words on the act
qujannamiik

recruitment & retention of health care providers
hon ed picco
qujannamiik uqaqti
uqaqti i rise to inform this house about the progress that the department of health & social services has made towards our vision of establishing a stable work force to serve the people of nunavut
we are all aware of the daily challenges that face the health and social service providers striving to meet the needs of nunavummiut
in recognition of their valued work our department has earmarked 1 26 million dollars in pay adjustments for nunavut nurses and social workers retroactive mr speaker to april 1st 1998
these adjustments will place our nurses and social workers amongst the highest paid in canada
this mr speaker is only one step towards creating a stable work force and i believe a demonstration of the high regard in which we hold our nurses and social workers
mr speaker the department of health & social services is committed to being part of a government that seeks direction from the people
we have set up a team of representatives from across nunavut to recommend solutions to the challenge of recruiting and retaining nurses in our communities
this group the nunavut illusarijiit action team will work with nunavut health care providers and each member has direct experience about what it takes to attract and retain nurses within nunavut
their reports to the department will be treated with priority and contribute to the strategies being developed within the department
mr speaker the department is also in the process of hiring a nunavut work force development officer
this person will be primarily responsible for recruitment and retention activities within the department and will work closely with the nunavut illusarijiit action team
finally i am pleased to tell you that over the next several months i am planning to hold a series of ministerial focus groups in several nunavut communities
the purpose of these focus groups is to allow me to consult directly with staff from community health centres about their concerns and their recommendations about the issues effecting recruitment and retention of health care providers in nunavut
mr speaker we have taken the first steps towards developing an effective recruitment and retention strategy for nunavut and i look forward to updating this house as these initiatives develop
i should also add mr speaker that the mental health worker that was requested last week for arviat is now going to be in place in the coming weeks
thank you mr speaker

french language school in iqaluit
hon james arvaluk interpretation
yesterday i said i was going to be speaking in english and today i am going to be speaking in french
interpretation mr speaker i am pleased to inform the assembly that the department of education and the government of canada have reached an agreement in principle to construct a french as a first language school in iqaluit
the new french school will give us an opportunity to demonstrate our belief in cultural diversity within nunavut
the building of this facility has long been a goal of the local francophone society
mr speaker the site for the new school will be adjacent to the middle school in the new subdivision and will share the yet to be constructed playground that will serve both schools
mr speaker operational costs will come from the existing funding formula and supplemented through heritage canada funding for programs in support of french language instruction
the new french school will directly cost the government of nunavut approximately 500 thousand dollars over two years
in addition the government of nunavut and the town of iqaluit will provide 600 thousand dollars of in kind contributions
the federal government will spend an estimated 4 5 million dollars to build the school
nunavut will also receive approximately 539 thousand dollars in federal funds for program support and development to cover the costs of a french school program co-ordinator support staff and associated administrative costs

there are seven other operating businesses in nunavut
i am pleased to announce that the following people will make up the nunavut development corporation s board

relaxation tapes and inuit
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
usually we don t comment about retail products here but i would like to make an exception
as employees or public servants or members of the legislative assembly we have a hard time sleeping sometimes because of all the jobs that we have to do
when i went to victoria for an education ministers conference my wife told me to look for a tape recording that would be soothing and serene and would put me to sleep at night
when i put it on the sound of animals and the outdoors came on i became more awake and very very alert
my instinct was to get ready and go hunting
so i don t suggest those tapes be bought by inuit

mla sharks goalie
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
since today is friday i am very pleased that we did quite a bit of work this week and now i hope we will be able to relax soon
last night at the hockey game i was one of the observers and i was told to be the cheerleader to help cheer for the members of the legislative assembly
i did my best but i guess it didn t help very much as the mla team lost
i couldn t quite figure out the time because the clock seemed to be at a standstill i don t know whose time zone it was on
i also couldn t recognize the goalie for our team
i didn t like his performance and i was yelling remove the goalie get rid of him
i kept saying that and then my son came over and gave me his hockey stick
i used it to bang on the wall while chanting get rid of him remove the goalie
it was then that i found out it was paul okalik our premier
so i apologize today to paul okalik because everyone else at the arena heard me and knew who it was and i didn t
unknowingly i kept telling the people there to remove him

sanikiluaq s position on time zone change
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
although you may be relaxed today myself i am not
in regards to the time zone yesterday the hamlet council of sanikiluaq had an urgent meeting with the residents of sanikiluaq in regards to the single time zone
they are still very opposed to the change
usually on october 31st they just want to turn back with daylight savings time by one hour
so they passed a motion to turn back one hour only mr speaker

arvaluk and hall beach
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
it is my pleasure that this morning you could loosen up and i am going to be speaking on a contentious issue
we of course have many friends and james arvaluk and i have known each other for a long time for as long as i can remember
i had never gone hunting with him during our years growing up together
i think it was in the 1980 s that he came to my community of hall beach
i am not going to give you the full details of what he was like in hall beach but in the summer my older brother myself and jamesie went beluga whale hunting quite far from my community
so james said in response people tell us not to leave meat behind so i want to load it up in the canoe

compromise for time zone issue
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker mr speaker today i rise to speak about the issue of the single time zone for nunavut
mr speaker i commend the government for moving on this issue which is designed to unify nunavut
having one time zone for nunavut is something that i personally support and also my constituents
mr speaker i am fortunate to live in a community that is in the geographic centre of nunavut
this means for the people of my region and my community that they will not have to make a major change on october 31st
but mr speaker it distresses me that many of the communities in the baffin are expressing much discontent about this as it effects them more deeply
mr speaker i am sure that if this were my community that had been effected i would feel the same as the members from clyde river and the other communities that have expressed concern about the change
this past week we have had petition after petition presented on this issue and letter after letter from mayors and councillors indicating that motions had been passed not to change their clocks at the end of the month
mr speaker if we are to have this change done in the spirit of unifying nunavut then we must do it in a manner which unifies and doesn t divide the people
surely there must be some compromise which will allow the people of the baffin communities to understand that the government is listening to their concerns
we have heard some suggestions from people to move the date of implementation of this initiative forward to the spring or summer when it would have less effect on the people s immediate routines
could we openly accept that some communities might postpone the date they implement the changes and welcome that in the spirit of phasing in this change rather than seeing it as an act of defiance
could we phase in so that the kitikmeot and kivalliq region begin on october 31st and the east begins on april 1st or july 1st
mr speaker i don t know what the consensus or compromise should be but i do know that in the spirit of unifying nunavut we must try to reach it on this important issue

funding for access road
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have a question to the minister of community government
i have a question in regards to inadequate funding for an access road that was built
the minister had made a statement that the hamlets have to request funding on an annual basis
my question is do we have to do that
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
minister of community government mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in regards to the building of roads outside of the hamlet boundaries i believe with the past government they got funding to build additional roads that are outside of the hamlet boundaries
this didn t get passed on to the nunavut government but we are presently having discussions with the federal government department of transportation
we hope soon to get funds for those types of projects but i can t tell you exactly how much money we will be receiving
i can only say that we will review those types of programs programs that are set up for access roads
i do know that there was such a program set up by the gnwt but i don t know we ll look into it and have discussions with the federal government

question 98 - 1 3
wheelchair for clyde river resident
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct my question to the minister of health and social services
we have a disabled person in our community who has been waiting for a wheelchair for a long time could you tell me the status or give me an update on what is happening
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister responsible for health mr picco
hon ed picco thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i attended along with premier okalik the founding meeting for disabled people for nunavut here in iqaluit and at that meeting i think the person that the member is talking about was there
it was a sad situation mr speaker the person that the member was talking about from his community was in an ill fitted wheelchair
after seeing that myself and the premier immediately made a phone call to the hospital and by the time the person in question had left the meeting to go back to their home they had a replacement wheelchair
i think that was a very good thing to see
so the status of that if that is what the member is asking about is the wheelchair will be replaced and a motorized wheelchair has been ordered by the baffin regional health and social services board for that patient
i believe the chairman is mr davidee arnaquq who i have had an opportunity to meet at that meeting and have been in communication with him in the past
the worker here in iqaluit is meeka kilabuk who needs no introduction
thank you mr speaker

thank you mr picco

when do we expect that wheelchair to come into my community
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister of health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker we should point out i guess at this time and explain something about wheelchairs
a lot of people believe that you just sit in a wheelchair
indeed mr speaker the wheelchair has to be fitted properly
we have a person right now working for the baffin regional health and social services board who is actually trained in fitting people for a wheelchair
you just don t take any wheelchair mr speaker
what had happened previously with that patient to my understanding is that there was only one wheelchair available in clyde river and that was given to the person because they needed a wheelchair
it wasn t fitted properly and this was pointed out to me as the minister of health and social services and premier okalik when we attended the meeting here in iqaluit
we rectified the situation by getting a wheelchair and getting it fitted at that time at the hospital
the wheelchair in question mr speaker is a motorized wheelchair it has a battery where the person will be able to navigate in their home which is a good thing
thank you mr speaker

mr irqittuq
question 99 - 1 3
doctor for igloolik
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is to the minister of health and social services
last spring we were supposed to get a doctor in igloolik which is my constituency and you said this at the time that you and i went to igloolik
you told the igloolik residents that you would be getting them a resident doctor
but this was not the case so now my question is mr speaker are there any plans to get this doctor for igloolik
speaker
thank you mr irqittuq
minister for health and social services
mr picco hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i am so pleased that the member has brought up this question and the reason of course being the misinformation surrounding the doctor and the community of igloolik
when i arrived at a community meeting at a public meeting the mayor and indeed the council had already known that the baffin regional health and social services board were looking at placing a doctor in igloolik
i never said i was putting one there
i never said that at all
what happened at the meeting i said i understood that it was my understanding that there would be doctor coming here
and the mayor who worked for dpw understood that there had been a process at that time trying to get a room ready at the health centre
so they were aware of it of the possibility of a doctor going to igloolik the possibility of putting a doctor in igloolik
after saying that mr speaker what we have in nunavut for primary health care is nurse practitioners
putting a doctor in a community doesn t make people more healthy mr speaker
we have good trained professionals in communities
when i have attended the health ministers meetings with all the national ministers they talk about having a model like we have
we have nurse practitioners a doctor in a community doesn t make you more healthy
and that s the kind of things that we re working toward
i d like to thank the member for bringing it up and clarifying the issue with the doctor
speaker
thank you mr picco
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i don t know if he understood my question
are there any plans to get a doctor in igloolik in the future
that was my question
i didn t ask any other question
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister for health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker there are no plans underway to my knowledge by the baffin region health and social services board to staff a doctor in igloolik at this time that s at this time
that s at this time
at this time that s not the case
so at this time speaker no that s not something that to my knowledge is being looked at but it can be something that can be looked at in the future
thank you mr speaker

question 100 - 1 3
bowhead whale study
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister of sustainable development wildlife division
in one of my constituencies there is an abundance of bowhead whales
in pelly bay they would like to be able to harvest bowheads but they were told by the department of fisheries and oceans that this bowhead stock comes from the baffin region
my question is has there been any study as to where these stocks come from
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr alakannuark
minister for sustainable development mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation yes thank you mr speaker
yes in regard to the bowhead whales we keep hearing more about the concerns about bowhead whales as to where they migrate to
but at this point with the nunavut wildlife management board we re working very closely together through research we study as to how these species are important to inuit people
dfo in ottawa had done a study and research on this
they are now collecting all the results
thank you
speaker
oral questions mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we would like to know if there has been any study done on bowhead whales in the pelly bay area
so i would like the minister for sustainable development to look into this further

mr puqiqnak
question 101 - 1 3
appointment to boards
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister for sustainable development
i keep asking the minister for that department
however mr speaker this morning under ministers statements on the nunavut development corporation and nunavut business credit corporation these two boards
did you appoint these members as a minister
did you appoint these people
speaker
thank you mr puqiqnak
minister for sustainable development mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk
interpretation thank you mr speaker
if i understand your question correctly you are looking for the names to be appointed to these boards
we had asked for nominations and then we had publicized this and the appointments were made through the nominations of regular members
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr kilabuk
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i apologize
i did not see any documentation
so my apologies because the kitikmeot region for example we do have a member
i apologize
my constituency is not represented in this board that you just appointed
i suggest that we utilize all the communities
the other community in my constituency is not represented on this board
so i don t think that we should be lopsided
thank you
it s up to you mr kilabuk minister for sustainable development to respond hon peter kilabuk interpretation
for the board appointments on the statement i just made if the communities have concerns or they want us to review this again you can go to this board if you have any concerns
if an mla or if members of the legislative assembly have any concerns you can go ask questions to the board at the time when we asked for nominations there were not many names that were submitted
question 102 - 1 3
internet services in communities
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
over the last while we ve heard a lot about the information highway and internet service to communities
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister responsible for pwtts
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
we have been thinking of linking up all the communities but at this time we re putting priority on the larger communities but the smaller communities are planned for the future
we hope to link up all the nunavut communities some time in the future
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you ms thompson
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
i realize that it s probably not a high priority the other communities in nunavut right now but coming into iqaluit and having internet service myself it s opened up a whole new world for me
and for me to access the internet in my community - and when i talk i want to talk about the arctic bays of the world the chesterfield inlets whale coves that it s a long distance connect charge
and i think with this day and age we re going into the millennium and i look around this room today and there s so many young children that could access information
and that is also good for the business community for people to sell their traditional things like clothing and carvings and stuff like that
could the minister be more direct in what kind of a time line we re looking at with providing internet service to the smaller communities
thank you
speaker
my staff is aware of this that it s something that we have to find a way for those communities to start connecting with internet thank you
i don t have a timeline on when we re going to do these things thank you
thank you mr speaker i don t want to put undue pressure on the minister to give me too much of a timeline
but as we all know this government is in sort of a financial surplus and it s my humble opinion that internet access in nunavut should be available to everybody in nunavut
and i m wondering if the minister would go forward to her cabinet colleagues and fmbs to give the rest of nunavut what the larger regional centres have
because i feel that this is important to myself and all the people of nunavut to have internet access
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean minister responsible for telecommunications and technical services ms thompson
hon manitok thompson thank you mr speaker
right now we re just putting in government services and not the public but i can certainly bring that forward to my cabinet colleagues because it s important to all of nunavut
i realize that so yes i ll do that thank you
speaker thank you
oral questions mr o brien
mr o brien it s ok
oral questions mr iqaqrialu
question 103 - 1 3
health statistics
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have a question for the minister of health and social services
those of us who live in nunavut there s approximately a total population of twenty eight to thirty thousand i m not quite sure i m just approximating the figure
yesterday we said that the people of nunavut are the heaviest smokers in canada and there s approximately ninety per cent of us who smoke
we have the smallest population
how come we always have the largest population with social problems
there s other canadians in the millions - how come we re always told that we have the highest population with social problems when we have a very very small population
could you explain this mr minister
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr picco
hon ed picco
speaker the member brings up an interesting area and that is the area of ratios stats numbers figures
i m not a mathematician speaker or indeed as mr ng said a statistician
what i am is a person who understands what the question is the member is trying to bring up if i m correct is why our rate is so high
and that s based on a ratio
and i ll try to explain it this way
when you look across canada as a population as a group of people the ratio of people smoking for example in this case is higher when it is compared to other provinces other territories other jurisdictions within our country
so what that means is when you look at canada as a whole maybe one in one thousand people has a certain kind of cancer
and then we take that and in nunavut it may be based on our smaller population ratio it may be five in one thousand people
it doesn t mean that because we have a smaller population base why are we having these numbers
each population ratio stands alone on its own merits as it were
so in this case the reason why we have so many high numbers is based on the ratio that s brought forward per capita
that s what we always use as the number mr speaker is per capita
i don t know if that helps the member to explain why it seems so high even though we have a small population we have higher incidences of this
so when you take the general population of canada as a whole and we say for every one thousand people there are twenty break and entries for example and when you look at nunavut there is thirty seven
the reason for that is based on the smaller population based on the smaller ratio
it comes down to the lowest common denominator
in that case speaker we are higher on a national average in a lot of these instances like tb like infectious diseases like sexually transmitted diseases suicide rate and so on
and i hope that helps clarify the answer
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i can never believe those numbers because of our small population
i just feel that we re made to look bad in nunavut
maybe the people out there want us to look bad through alcohol abuse heavy smoking a large population that smokes
it seems that we re always the ones having all these things
we have a very very small population
that s one of the reasons why i can never understand it
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr picco
hon ed picco thank you mr speaker
those are accurate numbers mr speaker
now i think that the concern the member has is that because we have such a low population base is why do they seem so high
those numbers are correct
those numbers have been checked
they have come forward they haven t changed in x number of years
my explanation maybe wasn t that good on the ratio and how those numbers are valid
maybe after the sitting this morning we can have someone sit down with the member and go through ratios and percentages and how those numbers are extrapolated out of the national averages for nunavut
i think that s what the member is trying to get at
maybe yourself mr speaker or maybe the minister of education with his background could go through the ratio and percentages so it could be more understandable
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions
oral questions
mr irqittuq
question 104 - 1 3
telehealth systems
mr irqittuq
interpretation thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i have a question for the minister of health and social services
he said that even if we get the resident doctor in our community the number of illnesses will not decrease that was his response
so my question is for example setting up tvs is very important there s a lot of telehealth systems up now and the patient is diagnosed through the telehealth system
are these telehealth systems better than resident doctors
speaker
thank you mr irqittuq
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker what i was trying to point out is that in other jurisdictions not just here in nunavut a lot of governments would like to move toward a nurse practitioner model
we have a nurse practitioner in a community identifying the problems that the people are having and work on the preventive side of medicine - and that s what we re trying to do
what a doctor does is diagnosis and this also applies to treatment
the member asked a question specifically on telehealth
i think mr speaker telehealth is probably one of the most exciting technological opportunities that have come a long way for us here in nunavut
telehealth has proven itself in other jurisdictions across this country and across the world
for example in australia it s really taking off
in norway i believe in june there s going to be an international conference of circumpolar countries on telehealth and the applications of telehealth for the circumpolar world
in canada many of the other provincial jurisdictions and territorial jurisdictions are using or experimenting with the application of telehealth
in our case for example mr speaker as the member knows we had a case where we had - i think it was eight people who had some problems with a skin rash
and the doctor was asked to review this case
they were able to stay in their community to be treated so that s one of the exciting things about telehealth
this government is trying to move forward
we re trying to put some money into our budget to enhance the delivery of telehealth as we explained in this house and again in the caucus last week
thank you mr speaker

multi-year plans
mr nutarak interpretation

my question is directed to the community government housing & transportation minister
previously we had made a five year plan in the communities and then they stated that we are going to have a longer plan for 20 years

usually the communities do their five year plan
is there going to be a new system for that mr speaker

i would also like to tell the member that we re going to be doing community tours and i m sure that this is going to be one of the issues that will be brought up

so i would suggest that if we re going to be making five year capital plans at the community level that we work with the nunavut government officials so that they ll be better alignment between the two

staffing for elders societies
mr iqaqrialu
thank you mr speaker
i have a question directed to the minister of culture language elders & youth and perhaps it s similar to what mr nutarak asked
the elders have societies in the majority of the communities in nunavut
they very much require good staff such as a secretary

question 114 - 1 3
marketing for fish
mr irqittuq
thank you mr speaker
i know that we have a limited time for question period i will limit my question mr speaker
i have a question to the minister of sustainable development
today it seems to be harder for my communities of igloolik and hall beach to start a small business
during the fall around october and november at this time of the year the fishermen used to have a viable market for arctic char but now a days it s really hard to market arctic char
perhaps the minister of sustainable development can find out where we can market this fish
thank you
speaker
thank you mr irqittuq
minister for sustainable development mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in regards to the question of marketing of arctic char i have worked in this area for four years in pangnirtung
the fishermen in the communities in all of nunavut have worked very hard and have met stumbling blocks in marketing their fish
the department of sustainable development at this time can support a fisherman financially if they apply for funding but for the last three years it s been very hard to market char due to the marine mammal protection act
since there are rules and regulations to follow especially in the communities where there is no fish plant
the fish has to be cleaned adequately and they have to be inspected
one of the things that people misunderstand is that we know what arctic char is
we like to eat it as a whole fish but the southern consumers would like to see the fish processed
they prefer to buy processed fish
it has been pretty hard but at least we re learning what consumers want down south
we have to follow consumers needs
we are aware that arctic char is very important to inuit of nunavut
speaker
thank you mr kilabuk

hon kelvin ng
thank you mr minister
mr chairman the purpose of the supplementary appropriation bill is to make supplementary appropriations for the government of nunavut for the fiscal year ended march 31 2000
authority is requested for a total 8 million 146 thousand in additional appropriations made up of 4 million 539 thousand for operations and maintenance and 3 million 607 thousand for capital expenditures
a number of interdepartmental transfers are also included in the supplementary appropriations which do not require additional funding
these transfers include funding for the establishment of the decentralization secretariat the transfer of responsibility for nunavut s housing program to public works and the transfer for nunavut s income support program to education
mr chairman the additional appropriations have been provided for in the estimated supplementary appropriation requirements included in the 99/2000 main estimates as a contingency reserve
however they do consume much of our 10 million dollars reserve and we will have to be very vigilant over the balance of the year
the costs incurred relative to the temporary library space and the common mechanical utilities facility in cambridge bay will be included in the insurance claim with respect to the loss of the high school
those are my opening comments mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister ng

chairperson interpretation
there is a motion in your white binders
please read your proposed amendment or your motion
committee motion 1 - 1 3
amendment to bill 5
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i move that bill 5 be amended by deleting the schedule and substituting the following schedule which would have vote 1 - operations and maintenance listed at 3 million 495 thousand dollars
part 2 - capital listed at 3 million 607 thousand dollars
that would have a total supplementary appropriation in parts 1 and 2 of 7 million 102 thousand dollars

agreed mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
could you give me an elaboration on what these negative numbers represent
because it could be a deficit
why is there a negative figure here
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu would like clarification on the negative number
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
mr chairman this is an expenditure in establishing the decentralization secretariat and it is as a result of transferring one individual from the department of finance to the division secretariat
so the negative would show up here and a positive would show up in the executive department later on
thank you mr chairman

mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman this again is one of the internal government transfers it is coming from the department of education to the department of human resources
so the programs that are intended to be delivered wouldn t change as this is a shift in responsibilities between departments
this is the public service training program so it is for government wide training initiatives of our staff mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the department of education sets the programs but now they always keep saying that they don t have enough money how come they are transferring these dollars to a different department
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
mr chairman it is primarily because it was felt that the role for staffing government of nunavut staffing was the responsibility of the department of human resources so the department has agreed to this transfer
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
maybe because i don t understand maybe if you could explain to me i would feel better about it
this is going to human resources from the department of education right
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr minister did you want to respond
hon kelvin ng
yes i will try again mr chairman
mr chairman it is for a specific program for the public service commission training program for employees
if i can use another example later on it might clarify it
so it is the same type of thing we are still delivering the housing program it is just a transfer of the responsibilities for the budget goes from one department to another
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister

mr minister
hon kelvin ng

the total is not 467 thousand
where did the total come from

mr chairman the total is the addition of the 522 thousand and you take away the negative amount of 55 thousand and that s how you get the total departmental amounts at the bottom of the page
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
yes going back to the total department previously authorized 457 thousand

mr akesuk interpretation
is this essential
that 200 is it just for that department
why do you need it now
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman mr chairman the primary reason for it is establishing the automated personal property registry system because the current system now lacks certainty
it inhibits and increases the cost of commercial transactions as a result of not having an automated system
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
does that answer your question mr akesuk ok

are there any comments or questions
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
i assume this is the appropriate time to ask questions about the special warrants on page 17
mr chairman with all the excitement or confusion over the last few minutes i didn t have any questions before that but now i found a few as they relate to special warrants
i would like to ask the minister to just give a definition again we had this already but just to refresh my memory a definition of a special warrant
then my question would be in relation to the 250 thousand dollars that has been identified i believe for a temporary library
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister ng would you like to respond
hon kelvin ng
mr chairman a definition of a special warrant is a mechanism for advancing spending authority to allow a department to respond quickly to new or unforeseen needs that meet specific criteria
the criteria are
when the legislative assembly is not in session and the board reports to the commissioner a that an expenditure is urgently required
b that the expenditure is in the public interest and c there is no appropriation or insufficient expenditure the commissioner may authorize a special warrant authorizing the expenditure
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister ng
i think mr o brien has another question
mr o brien
the question is in relation to the 250 thousand dollars that were filed under a special warrant i believe it was decided by cabinet on september 9th that this was a necessary expenditure
it indicates that the money is to provide a temporary library while the school is being built
can the minister explain why it was necessary to have this special warrant in september when all the members were meeting just a few weeks later to discuss these issues
why was it necessary to do it under a special warrant
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
the department of education had this and many other funding requests with the financial management board and this particular one had come forward for that september meeting and it was approved at that time
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister for your response
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman it may not seem like a large amount in the overall scheme of the project but it is significant when you look at some of the needs that we have elsewhere
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the building is owned by the municipality
they ve offered to provide the building and it has become available at no lease cost so they are providing it with the understanding that the government undertakes the capital renovations
the renovations include strengthening of the floor to permit the storage of books upgrading the heating system and other internal modifications
there is also a part of this 250 thousand dollars for furniture in the amount of 25 thousand dollars
i can t speak right now to what the usage would be after the new library is built and the books and resources are moved from there but obviously they would be used by the municipality for some community purpose
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister ng
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman this special warrant ties into the construction of the school that burnt down last year i believe and there is an insurance factor in here that the insurance will pay for this
we still don t seem to have a complete picture on exactly how much the school is going to cost whether it is 6 7 8 9 million dollars
we don t seem to know that
i see some other indicators here that i haven t seen before
my question is how much insurance money are we expecting from the school that burnt down and how much is the new school actually going to cost
will the 250 thousand dollar special warrant that is going to build the temporary library will that be factored back into the new school
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
may we have a response please mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman there is currently an insurance claim being prepared with respect to the loss of the high school and the common mechanical utilities facility that we ll be dealing with later
part of this mr chairman this claim will include the temporary facility space that is required
thank you chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr o brien mr o brien
thank you mr chairman one last question i think the whole issue sort of begs a number of questions and i understand the need to replace the school that is understood
the insurance that we are talking about this is a year ago that school burnt down and we still don t have it resolved as far as the claim
is this a self insured arrangement where the government actually pays for the school out of its own dollars or is it through an insurance company
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman it is through an insurance company but with government buildings i believe the magnitude of the deductible would be approximately 1 million dollars
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
my final question does the minister expect that once the insurance is said and done that it will cover the costs of the new school with the costs that are indicated there

qujannamiik uqaqti
mr speaker i rise today to thank all the members of this assembly for taking the time earlier in october to attend the demonstration of the ikajuruti inungnik ungasiktumi network
the iiu network is a pilot project using modern computer and video technology that the department of health and social services is running right now in three baffin communities
mr speaker this is an exciting development which is helping to cut waiting times and improve access to health care in nunavut
with this technology we can help patients be diagnosed and counselled by doctors psychiatrists and other specialists more quickly and without the inconvenience of travelling to iqaluit or the south
this type of satellite linkup between doctors and patients is already practiced successfully in several canadian provinces and other countries world-wide
right now we are running the iiu network in cape dorset pond inlet and iqaluit
i am pleased to tell you that we are hoping to expand this service into rankin and arviat early next year
mr speaker as a government we are all committed to the health of our people and to making the best possible use of the resources available to us
i believe that telehealth is just one of the tools that we can use to make health care and social services more accessible and more effective for the people of nunavut
we look forward to tentatively expanding the iiu network into rankin and arviat next year and i will keep this house appraised as the project develops

nunavut arts council
hon donald havioyak
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i appreciate this opportunity to speak about the nunavut arts council
every jurisdiction in canada has an arts council that works in co-operation with both the government and the artistic community
the best way to distribute these funds is through the guidance and recommendations of skilled experienced specialists
a nunavut arts council is best suited to advise on the needs of the artists of nunavut
the council will also create a forum for nunavut s artistic community this forum will allow artists a direct and unified voice for requesting support and providing recommendations to the government
the nunavut art council supports our government s desire to increase public representation by involving more people in the decision making process
the department of culture language elders & youth is proud to announce that we will table the art council appointments before the end of november
there are several improvements that the residents of nunavut can expect when the arts council is formed
they can expect having arts funding decided upon through a fair process that includes the artistic community
they can expect having nunavut artists properly represented in the government and they can expect having an advisory body that works in partnership with the public to make nunavut a place where the arts are supported and encouraged

process used for time zone change
note
technical problems recording partially inaudible
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i rise today to talk about inuit qaujimajatuqangit and how it is integrated to the workings of the government
however the process used for bill 3 has reversed the purpose of integrating inuit qaujimajatuqangit into government practices
it has broken the spirit and intent of inuit qaujimajatuqangit
the government of canada has gone over the heads of the nunavut legislature with their passage of the regulation to change the time zone
this is the reason that we will discuss again today the issue of the time zone change when we resume the business of the house today
we need to discuss what is in the best interest of the residents of nunavut
we will need to discuss also the adverse effects of this change to our constituents

concerns of regular members over time zone change
mr nutarak interpretation
mr speaker i rise today as the chairperson of the regular members caucus to make an important statement on behalf of the regular members
we have a strong concern about the way the time zone issue has been handled by the government
our concern mr speaker is that we do not believe that the government informed us clearly and openly about how it planned to proceed with putting the time zone change into effect
we were encouraged by the commitments made by the government in pinasuaqtavut - the bathurst inlet mandate about openness co-operation and respect for mlas
the statement declares that co-operation will be the operating standard at every level and that mlas will be respected as important sources of community opinion
the standing committee on government operations considered bill 3 at its meeting on september 30 1999 and noted that there would be a dramatic change in certain communities where the time would go back two hours
so the committee asked in their letter to the government of september 30 whether the government would consider delaying the coming into force of bill 3 for communities where the time zone adjustment would be two hours
however the committee never received the courtesy of a formal response
regular members are also very concerned that the way the government chose to implement the time zone change was by regulations which were made and passed behind closed doors
the way this came about seems to have bypassed the legislative assembly
the government appears to have assumed that just because it had the legal power to make these regulatory changes the members would pass bill 3 without question
we now have learned that the necessary regulations were passed in early september by the nunavut government and in early october by the federal government
as recently as last friday some regular members were under the impression that delaying the passage of bill 3 would delay the implementation of the time zone changes
it was only late last week and early this week that the regular members began to realize that it is not necessary for bill 3 to pass for the time zone change to come into effect
the regulations were already made before our current session even began
our caucus feels that this should have been clearly disclosed to us and the public by the government
the result is that many regular members are feeling that they have had no voice in this important matter
some members were feeling that this legislative assembly is not important and they are concerned that the cabinet may be able to use its power and authority in this way again
they are concerned that they have had no opportunity to voice concerns and questions from their communities
and that those questions and concerns have been treated in a dismissive manner
mr speaker the regular members do not want this to happen again
we ask the government from here on to make it a practice to disclose to us in advance the details of any regulations which the government is planning which will have significant impacts on our communities
we also ask the government from now on to treat regular members with the spirit of openness co-operation and respect which has been promised in pinasquaqtavut

question 67 - 1 3
lack of aviation fuel
the member requested information as to why there was no aviation fuel in the communities of repulse bay and pelly bay
mr speaker with regards to repulse bay the department has placed drums of aviation fuel in this community this past re-supply season
however this fuel is for emergency medivac purposes only
certified bulk aviation fuel is available to aircraft in the surrounding three communities of rankin inlet coral harbour and baker lake for requirements other than emergencies
mr speaker with regard to pelly bay the department has a two year agreement in place with the canadian coast guard for sea lift purposes
the capability of the coast guard tanker to move fuel products to this community is restricted to one product so only p50 fuel is transported to pelly bay
given the extreme cost of airlifting additional types of fuel to this community we have not chosen to locate aviation fuel in pelly bay at this time
having said that mr speaker it should also been pointed out that there have been no requests from aircraft companies to position certified aviation fuel in pelly bay
airlift companies are currently using the p50 fuel in pelly bay as an acceptable alternative to certified aviation fuel
p50 fuel is historically cheaper than certified aviation fuel
the air companies are quite satisfied
additionally mr speaker those companies who would rather use certified aviation fuel can obtain this type of fuel from their alternates such as hall beach taloyoak igloolik and gjoa haven

hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to make a response to an oral question raised by mr o brien on october 26 1999 concerning the proper spelling of names
mr speaker the spelling of people s names is a very important issue that we cannot rush into or begin to solve overnight
there is a long history to learn from and the department of culture language elders & youth has begun working towards addressing everyone s concerns
i envision a nunavut wide public awareness campaign informing people of their options for making changes to their name
we know that the people of nunavut are responsible and accountable for their own well-being
our role is to provide awareness of this issue and to provide choices for people who want to change their name
mr speaker on this sensitive and difficult issue my deputy minister is developing a working plan that would be implemented over the next two years
the first action my deputy minister has taken is to invite deputy ministers of the department of health & social services education and justice to strategize how best to deal with this without disrupting peoples lives too much
in the strategy sessions it may be advisable to have input from the nunavut law review committee and nunavut tunngavik incorporated as 85 percent of our population are inuit
mr speaker from these actions my department will also develop an options paper that will outline the strategies we wish to propose
it is my desire to consult with the members and work together on establishing what it is that should be done

therefore there were no programs running at the nac building

the college will be delivering an adult basic education course as well as providing other services to the community such as career counselling testing and assessments
the college will be working with many community organizations to develop a training plan for the community and seek alternate funding to fund these programs

purchase of country food from kivalliq communities

thank you mr speaker
since i spoke in inuktitut so that enoki would hear i will provide this response in english
interpretation ends this response is to an oral question asked on friday october 29th by the member from baker lake on the purchase of country food from the kivalliq communities
at the present time the keewatin fish and meat plant in rankin can only purchase caribou from coral harbour
this is the only community that has a large enough quota to conduct a federally inspected commercial harvest
the community has a quota of 6 thousand commercial tags the communities of arviat baker lake chesterfield inlet repulse bay whale cove have a total tag allocation of 925
this does not make it economical to conduct a federal harvest in these communities
the keewatin fish & meat plant is purchasing about 40 thousand pounds of arctic char from rankin inlet chesterfield inlet and whale cove
as markets for these products increase the keewatin fish & meat plant will look at purchasing arctic char from the other communities in the keewatin region
i am advised that the nunavut development corporation is currently examining options for increasing their processing capacity and the opportunities for increasing market demand for caribou

manitoba to keewatin power grid
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
recently we had a delegation in discussing a preliminary study that took place regarding the power corporation and the possible linkage of the power grid that could be set up between churchill and arviat and the keewatin in general
also in that study was the possibility of a road link between churchill manitoba and the keewatin
i am not sure if the minister can speak to the road linkage but possibly to the status of the power grid preliminary studies
basically what were the results and also if there is a possibility of moving onto the next step which would be a more detailed analysis of this particular issue
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the report that the member talks about mr speaker came from manitoba hydro and it was a pre-feasibility study
now my understanding is that it was a pre-feasibility study that it is broad in its implications and that indeed it made some assumptions
for example my understanding after reading the report is that one of these assumptions was that every home in rankin inlet whale cove and arviat would switch to electric heat
so that would be some major cost implications if that occurred
what i am trying to do now as the minister for the power corporation here in nunavut is to make contact with our manitoba counterparts and to find out exactly what the next steps would be

speaker
thank you mr picco
final supplementary mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker in the report can the minister tell us whether it indicated that there would be true cost savings if this hydro line would be put in place
it is my understanding that in my region we are paying up to 70 cents per kilowatt hour where in manitoba they are paying 6 cents
the approximate cost of this grid would be in the neighbourhood of 180 million dollars over a 20 or 25 year period
can the minister indicate whether or not in the report it did show a saving
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the report is a weighty volume it is a very thick document
there are several assumptions made in the report
the cost to the customer would be 30 cents per kilowatt hour
if the electric power option mr speaker given the assumption again was 230 kv then all households would switch to electric heat and all potential mines would be hooked up to the power delivery grid
now mr speaker when we say the potential mines that i would assume would be the nettiling project and possibly the project near mr mclean s riding in baker lake
in that case it would be 12 cents per kilowatt hour and the cost to the customer would be 25 cents per kilowatt hour
again mr speaker we have to predicate these assumptions by saying that this is a pre-feasibility study

cost per patient at health boarding homes

i would like to direct this question to the minister of health & social services

how much do they pay per patient for the boarding home in ottawa
i would like to know how much a patient costs per night in these accommodations
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
i thank the member for the question
it is a good question
unlike the other two regions the keewatin region and the kitikmeot region we don t have a boarding home specific facility in ottawa
what we are using right now is a facility called the rotel
the rotel is operated by the ohsni group and it is used for patients going to ottawa using the ottawa general hospital and some of the other hospital facilities in ottawa
patients from ontario and other jurisdictions that need to go to ottawa also use the rotel
so it is not actually a nunavut specific facility

that s one of the first orders of business that will have to be resolved post-session mr speaker
so it s for those types of situations where the contingency would come into play and going through the proper channels for a request and going to the financial management board for approval

mr speaker once again i ll try to explain
it was based on expenditures up to september 30 plus the projected expenditures to get us to the end of the fiscal year
now there were no program specifics no specific program for student employment under c l e y or any department of this government
thank you
speaker
thank you mr ng
final supplementary mr o brien mr o brien

and my question again was why did this not happen when we have this money available and i would assume that these figures were available not this month but probably a month or two ago
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for human resources mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker first let s clarify
there were students employed over the course of the summer but they were not specifically funded by programs to municipalities or to housing associations or to businesses or non-profit organizations
they happened to be government of nunavut casual employees over the course of the summer
once again i would say to the member it s because there was no specific program outline and funding approved for summer students
now we recognize that honourable members of this house had brought up that issue in the spring session and it will hopefully be taken into consideration in the development of the 2000/2001 budgets

question 126 - 1 3
cost of caribou harvest in coral harbour
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
i got a response from the minister regarding the purchase of caribou for the fish and meat plant in rankin inlet and in his response he said that there s a commercial quota in coral harbour of over 6000
could the minister tell me what it cost the government a year for this commercial hunt
thank you
speaker interpretation

question 127 - 1 3
cost per patient in rotel
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i m going to re-elaborate the question i asked previously to the minister of health and social services
mr iqaqrialu asked a question in regards to the rotel which is used by the patients
the minister stated that the contract is for another year
my question is with that contract how much does it cost per patient
i hope i have made myself clearer
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr nutarak
the minister responsible for health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
the balance of the amount depends on how many patients actually use the service at the rotel
like i said before it is 124 dollars per night that we pay through nhip
out of that comes other service fees for facilitating the development and the usage of the rotel
thank you
speaker
thank you mr picco

mr nutarak interpretation
question to the minister of health and social services once again

item 11
reports of standing and special committees
ajauqtiit standing committee report on the information and privacy commissioner of nunavut
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i have the honour of presenting the report on the information and privacy commissioner of nunavut
this report was prepared by the standing committee - ajauqtiit after we conducted a thorough selection process to identify the most appropriate candidates for this important public office
as the report states our standing committee worked very hard to make sure that our selection process was thorough and unbiased
a sub-committee of three of our members conducted the interviews and the selection process for the languages commissioner and the information and privacy commissioners which included ovide alakannuark co-chair olayuk akesuk and myself as chair of the committee
members of our committee and sub-committee met twelve times on the matter of the information and privacy commissioner over the last two months we received twenty-seven applications from people across canada for this position
we conducted in person interviews of three candidates reviewed their written answers and questions and evaluated their experience and education as outlined in their resumes
we also received information from references for the final candidate
it was a very difficult decision for members because all of the candidates are very committed people
they were all interested in the position and they all have many skills and ideas to bring to the position
we thank them for applying
nevertheless we had to choose one name to recommend to the members of the legislative assembly
the information and privacy commissioner for nunavut must have many qualities
the commissioner must be a strong committed voice for open government which provides timely access to information and at the same time be an advocate for the protection of privacy
we believe that elaine keenan bengts has these qualities
she has learned a lot about the north in her thirty years living in yellowknife and in her last two and a half years in the position of information and privacy commissioner of the nwt
we see no conflict with her holding both positions
and there may be cost savings to both of our governments
she will represent both the nwt and nunavut in meetings with other information and privacy commissioners across canada elsewhere
elaine understands the challenges facing the government of nunavut and our need to be resourceful in meeting the requirements under the act in a most cost effective manner
her office will be accessible to the residents of nunavut through a toll free line and all materials will be developed in the official languages of nunavut
thank you mr speaker
at the appropriate time i will give notice of motion to appoint an information and privacy commissioner
speaker
thank you mr tootoo item 11
reports of standing and special committees
mr akesuk
standing committee on government operations and services report on the 1999-2000 six month departmental progress
mr akesuk
thank you mr speaker
i have the honour today to present the standing committee on government operations and services report on the 1999-2000 six month departmental progress
i am going to read the first two pages and then david is going to read the next two pages
in may of 1999 the standing committees of the legislative assembly of nunavut recommended in the house that government of nunavut departments provide mid-year progress updates to the committees for review
ministers and senior departmental officials appeared before the standing committees from october 14-16 1999
this exercise took place shortly before the opening of the third session of the legislative assembly and the tabling of the bathurst mandate
at the mid-point of the 1999-2000 fiscal year the standing committees were interested in gaining a picture of where the new government stood in terms of spending to date
legislative and policy plans and priorities for the remainder of the fiscal year
staffing progress
and other matters
unfortunately standing committees were again disappointed by the fact that departments were inconsistent in the manner in which materials were provided to committee members
while some departments provided thorough documentation others did not
few departments seemed able or willing to provide materials much in advance of ministerial presentations
problems with providing even short documents in both inuktitut and english were evident in some presentations
the standing committee again recommends that departmental materials be provided to members sufficiently in advance of appearances to allow for adequate preparation
and that all materials be fully translated
mr speaker generally speaking the standing committee on government operations and services was satisfied with the progress to date made by the three departments under its oversight mandate
this report will serve to highlight the standing committee s main observations and concerns
department of executive and intergovernmental affairs
premier okalik appeared before the standing committee on october 14
the standing committee is pleased with the efforts being made to develop sound working relationships with other jurisdictions while ensuring that nunavut s interests are effectively articulated
the committee is of the view that strong efforts should continue with respect to securing a fair deal for nunavut in such issue areas as fishing quotas a mineral accord and other issues requiring intergovernmental discussions
protocol agreement between the government of nunavut and nunavut tunngavik incorporated
members of the standing committee were provided the opportunity to review the protocol
the standing committee is supportive of this initiative to establish a sound working relationship between the government and nti
while recognizing the special role of the standing committee ajauqtiit in considering issues related to the government of nunavut s obligations with respect to the implementation of the nunavut land claims agreement
decentralization secretariat
the standing committee received a brief update on the work of the secretariat and took note that a total of 69 decentralized positions have been filled to date
the standing committee reiterates its fundamental support for decentralization and strongly recommends that the work of the secretariat proceed in an effective and timely fashion
the standing committee also recommends that the elected local leadership of communities impacted by decentralization receive formal updates on a monthly basis from the secretariat
nunavut law review commission maligarnik qimirrujiit
members are supportive of this important initiative
the standing committee recommends that careful consideration be paid to the challenge of how to effectively and realistically draw upon the special wisdom of elders in the commission s review of complex pieces of legislation
public utilities board
members are aware of the government s work in reviewing options in this area
the standing committee supports the establishment of a nunavut public utilities board at the earliest opportunity
government communication with nunavummiut
with respect to such issues as the move to a single time zone the standing committee feels that better efforts should be made to communicate government initiatives in a way that is sensitive to public concerns and perceptions

report on 1999-2000 six month departmental progress update
minister ng appeared before the standing committee on october 14
mid-year fiscal update
the standing committee is pleased that the government does not anticipate a deficit for 1999-2000
however members of the committee are concerned about the drop in projected personal and corporate income tax revenues given that the committee shares the minister s commitment to greater financial self-reliance
the standing committee recommends any government-wide surplus be allocated to address nunavut s housing crisis
division of assets and liabilities
the standing committee was informed that the final status of this process will not be known until later this year
the standing committee continues to take a strong interest in this issue and expects to be regularly updated
pay equity
while supporting the principle of pay equity the standing committee is concerned that the government take the appropriate steps to cover potential liabilities as a result of the ongoing tribunal process in ottawa
departmental staffing progress
the standing committee recognizes efforts being made by the department to meet inuit employment plan targets while acknowledging the need to build skills and capacity
the standing committee recommends that the department continue to make efforts to foster training opportunities in partnership with educational institutions in these skill areas
public-private partnerships
members of the committee take a strong interest in the direction that the government will take with respect to p3s
especially with respect to the issues of transparency and accountability
the standing committee recommends that it be consulted as the department moves forward on this issue and prior to final p3 criteria being established
budget consultations
department of human resources
given the impending termination of nuhrds funding the standing committee further recommends that every effort be made to successfully obtain necessary resources from federal partners inuit qaujimajatuqangit and the public service
the standing committee looks forward to progress reports on the success of these initiatives and emphasizes its support for a public service that is representative of the people of nunavut

reports of standing and special committees mr tootoo
ajauqtiit standing committee report on the 1999-2000 six month departmental progress updates
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker mr speaker i have the honour today of presenting the standing committee on ajauqtiit s report on the 1999-2000 six month departmental progress updates
i ll be going over part of the report and the honourable member mr iqaqrialu will be doing some as well
in the may 1999 report of the standing committee - ajauqtiit the standing committee recommended that they review the progress of the legislative assembly in its business plan at the six month point of the fiscal year
members of ajauqtiit did so on friday october 1st 1999 during a presentation from yourself mr speaker and the clerk of the legislative assembly after which members had an opportunity to ask questions
in terms of timely provision of information in these types of review exercises such as advanced review of budget and main estimates and the six month progress review nothing further has been worked out with the departments
it is noted that no departments provided materials in advance of their meetings with the respective standing committees
in addition only a few departments actually presented information on expenditures to date such as were provided by the legislative assembly
however most departments did have their materials in english and inuktitut
the standing committee again recommends that the departmental materials be provided to members sufficiently in advance of their appearance to allow for adequate presentation and that all materials be fully translated
the standing committee was given a detailed and up to date budget for the legislative assembly which included the amounts spent to september 30 1999 amounts committed and the balance for the remainder of the fiscal year
it is still difficult to project accurately with this budget because as noted in may the budget was estimated for nunavut based on the nwt
we cannot yet assess if the amounts for the year will be sufficient
however it was noted that as of september 30 the session expenses were higher because of the higher costs of operating in temporary and rented premises in april and may and june
the committee costs were lower as fewer committee meetings have been held
nevertheless it is clear that there will be some slippage in areas where the positions have not yet been filled - for example the languages commissioner and her staff
these savings will be applied to other expenses which were not planned in the budget such as opening celebrations for the legislative assembly building
at the half way point of the fiscal year just under 40 per cent of the budget has been spent or committed
therefore it does not appear that a supplementary budget appropriation will be necessary for the legislative assembly
the one area where there may need to be a supplementary appropriation is for the expenses relating to the building security and janitorial services
members were advised that it is the department of public works that is responsible for these duties but it appears that there has been no specific funding allocated for these areas of expenditure for the legislative assembly
members were advised that the audio-visual system is being installed but is still behind schedule due to delays in the delivery of specialized equipment
the clerk noted that an interim system had been installed to ensure that this session - october - november would proceed and arrangements had been made for renting interpretation equipment
members were further advised that the audio visual system should be in place by the end of november
in the may 1999 report a strong recommendation was made to continue following up with the federal government to obtain capital funding for these items which had been overlooked in the original capital plan for the legislative assembly
members reluctantly acknowledged that these capital expenses must therefore come out of nunavut s capital budget for this fiscal year
members were especially pleased that elders were being invited from each of nunavut s constituencies for the opening
nevertheless members were concerned at the lack of space for the public in the chamber
this is always a greater concern at special events like openings
the standing committee recommends that the speaker present options for ensuring that the public will have access to the chamber when in session
if these options would require additional capital expenditures such as renovations or an addition or additional audio visual expenses these should be put forward in the five year capital planning exercise
members were also advised that the legislative assembly website was up internally and that the shelves had been established and were waiting for data
members were being asked to provide updated information on their own biographies
soon hansard bills committee reports member profiles will be available to anyone with internet access
in elaboration to questions about public space in the chamber members were advised that the legislative assembly was originally designed as an office building and was adapted to be the legislative assembly of nunavut
this was due to the fact that the groups planning for nunavut forgot to put a legislative assembly in the plans
as a result there were some features which were not able to meet all the needs of the legislative assembly
for example it was not possible to have a large public gallery
members felt it would be prudent to begin now to start planning for the time that a new building would be required
for example they wondered if a reserve could be set aside each year for the next ten or fifteen or twenty years
members do not want the same mistake to be made wherein the need to consider a legislative assembly building is an afterthought
i ll turn over the next part of the report to my colleague the honourable member for uqqumiut
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
member for uqqumiut
mr iqaqrialu
sessional and standing committee expenses
mr iqaqrialu
thank you mr speaker
as requested in the may report members were given detailed information about the cost of one day of session and one day of committee s work
it was noted that for the sake of tracking the overall budget was divided amongst the four standing committees and the management and services board
expenditures on behalf of the members
it was noted that an orientation workshop in iqaluit had been provided for members constituency assistants and that most members now have offices established with computers etc
in response to a question it was noted that if members wished computer training this will be provided by legislative assembly staff
mr speaker noted that the legislative assembly has now contracted with a local service provider for hansard which is produced in both english and inuktitut
appointments to offices under the jurisdiction of the legislative assembly and related legislation
it was noted in may meetings there are several key appointments made on the recommendation of the legislative assembly whose budget fall under the legislative assembly
the standing committee of ajauqtiit has been co-ordinating the process of selecting names to recommend to the legislative assembly which is hoped will happen this session for the following three positions
language commissioner conflict of interest commissioner and information and privacy commissioner
the standing committee of ajauqtiit will present separate reports to the house with respect to these appointments
it was noted that once these commissioners are in place the standing committee of ajauqtiit has reviewed the need for legislative reform in these three areas
members were advised that the report on the first nunavut election held on february 15 1999 would be tabled during this session
afterwards the standing committee on ajauqtiit will be asked to review it and any recommendations therein
as noted above the members will also review the need for legislative reform to ensure the elections act is appropriate for nunavut
other initiatives
it was noted that the legislative process had been agreed upon and that members were now working with it
in particular the legislative process provides that the draft bills be provided to the appropriate standing committee for comment prior to introduction in the legislative assembly
this process will be reviewed once the members have had the opportunity to work with it over the course of the session
in terms of other legislative initiatives in the legislative assembly it was noted that a consultation process had been initiated for symbols for nunavut
these symbols will be reviewed by the legislative assembly
it was agreed in baker lake that there would be no changes to the flag act
however it is anticipated that symbols for the official flower and other symbols for nunavut will be selected in the near future as part of this process
clarification of roles and relationships on land claims matters
in the may 1999 report the standing committee of ajauqtiit expressed the wish to clarify how the different government departments and the different standing committees would work on land claims matters
the committee has been advised that a draft protocol with nti is being worked on by the office of the premier and executive and intergovernmental affairs
the committee has expressed its wish to be consulted during this protocol and hopes that this protocol will help clarify this relationship
inuit qaujimajatuqangit
members were pleased to hear the continuing developments by the legislative assembly to ensure a role for inuit qaujimajatuqangit in its systems
as well members want to celebrate inuit culture and language in the work of the assembly
now that the legislative assembly building is finished there is a permanent home for the public display of the mace and other symbols of the assembly which are unique to nunavut
the clerk advised that elders and youth would play a role in the opening of the new chamber
further efforts have been made to ensure that inuit art would be displayed in the building for the opening members will be advised as to the status of the permanent art collection for the building
non inuktitut speaking staff look forward to taking inuktitut classes established through the human resources department
legislative assembly staff also participated in an iq workshop organized by the department of culture language elders & youth and hope to follow up on the recommendations that emerge from that workshop

the standing committee of ajauqtiit continues to operate
in the words of one of our members our first year as a new legislature is going to be a learning experience and we ll be identifying issues
i think it was during the june session that we said we wanted to operate more effectively and more accountably as a new legislature
we want to think about how we would want to see our legislature be different than the nwt
i think at some point we need to review how we are doing and where we want to see changes
we are pleased with the progress of the legislative assembly and look forward to continuing to play a role in reviewing it s work and ensuring it is appropriate to the needs of nunavut

hon paul okalik interpretation

chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
general comments to bill 3
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i don t really have a presentation for this bill just a brief summary this idea is not new and we have been seeking options for the benefit of nunavut
we are trying to remove barriers as representatives of nunavummiut what i was trying to seek was what would best represent nunavummiut
this has been dealt with for quite some time now and we have not been the only ones who have dealt with it
the mayors of all the nunavut communities have dealt with it nti has dealt with it
this is an issue that began in discussions in the month of april and this is just part of our mandate and we have many other issues to take on
this is an issue that effects communities and we also have other issues such as decentralization and we will want to deal with staff in all of nunavut
this has now been in force for the past two days so all the nunavummiut are using the same time zone so irrespective of where you are in nunavut you can call me at the same time
it is almost 6 o clock and it is the same time in all the nunavut areas
this has a big impact on all nunavummiut because this is the first time we have taken responsibility and will have a shared time zone
this will have certain benefits
we can now have better working relationships because of this single time zone irrespective of whether you are in the west or the keewatin or from this region
the single time zone will benefit you and if you want to work with us we will be a participant
there have been slight problems as we all know but we d like you to realize that we have one time zone for all communities and we want to experiment with this so we have put forward the legislation
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
we re still under general comments
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
bill 3 if you were to look at the format under number 3 the first states that the commissioner of nunavut by and with the advice and consent of the legislative assembly enacts as follows
it is already written here when you go down to 4 if this act receives assent on or before october 31 this act comes into force at 2 00 a m on october 31 1999
if this act receives assent on or before october 31 1999 this act comes into force the day it was enacted
i m going back to the first one where the commissioner of nunavut by and with the advice and consent of the legislative assembly
the members of the legislative assembly did not deal with this bill bill 3 so therefore it did not follow the proper procedures because it has a negative impact on the people
the members of the legislative assembly have not had a chance to consult with their constituencies in regards to this single time zone
so that s where the problem occurs with us
today if we look at the communities some of the communities i hear have not followed the time zone because the communities are broken up because of this issue and especially in the baffin region
it has a negative impact for that reason
i just wanted to point that out
i know there are other general comments around the floor
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr premier would you like to respond
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i know that we have already agreed we would come up with a single time zone and when we had our meeting in baker lake we also discussed this with the members of the legislative assembly
in august we stated that also
the regulations have been worked on since september 30 and myself i have publicized that changes to the regulations of the nunavut government and the federal government were made already
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i think we have discussed this here
however as to how we will arrange the time zones as mla s we have never been involved as to whose time zone we will follow whether we will lose 2 hours we ve never discussed that
i just wanted to state that as a supplementary
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
if you wish to respond mr premier
we are not trying to make corrections irrespective of where you are in nunavut you have the right to call us and have access to us anyway just going back to the old arrangements it will be too cumbersome
we can only deal with odd hours if you are from cambridge bay or if you are from iqaluit
we will probably be able to consider this again if a real problem did arise because of the new time zone
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
according to my list of members who wish to speak i ll start with mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
bill 3 was it in english inuktitut and french
i think it would be advisable if bill 3 was in all these three languages
so i m asking the premier if this was done
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
isn t it in three languages
what are you saying
chairperson interpretation
mr nutarak would you like to clarify your question
mr nutarak interpretation
i believe we should have it in four versions
if it s in four languages and dialectal versions we would be able to pass it but it is only in 3 versions and we cannot pass it
i just want clarification on that
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
does anybody wish to deliver a response
mr nutarak if it is appropriate with you maybe the legal advisor for nunavut can give a response to you
mr nutarak interpretation
i have no problem with who answers it because i just want clarification on that
ms cooper
thank you mr chairman
the legal requirement for the proper passage of the bill is that it be introduced in two languages
english and french but certainly in my book it has the bill in four languages mr nutarak
i m not sure if yours does
chairperson interpretation
thank you ms cooper
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you
yes a response is given if it s in inuktitut and inuinnaqtuun and if we re going to make it legislation for nunavut there will have to be three official languages for official questions to the legislation
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
i ll pass this again to ms cooper for a response
ms cooper
thank you mr chairman
if you were to want to make passage of the bill in four languages a legal requirement would be that it has to be done through a legislative change or amendment to the appropriate legislation
chairperson interpretation
thank you ms cooper
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
maybe to be brief with my comments
it is written in an english version and also i believe in french and inuktitut
i haven t seen the inuinnaqtuun version that s just my point
as it says the central standard time as i asked earlier what exactly does it mean
during the session if it is going to be central standard time i think the wording should be corrected if it is going to be written in english french inuktitut and inuinnaqtuun
on the inuktitut version if we have kitikmeot standard time yes there would be a difference of one hour
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
it is making reference to the central time zone
it is obvious the inuktitut version needs to be revised because in the english version you have central standard time but the wording in inuktitut refers to kitikmeot standard time
we have two different versions english and french but they have to be available in the regions so they ll have to be revised as to the exact wording
that was just a supplementary
if it can be revised i would like to recommend that it be revised
if the premier wants to revise then i ll agree with him including the whole content of bill 3
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes number 4 2 as it reads if this act receives assent as of october 31 1999 this act comes into force on assent even if it s not really assented
as soon as it s assented it will be in full force after october 31
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
as i mentioned earlier the different languages should correlate to each other
it states here if this act receives assent on or before october 31 this act comes into force at 2 00 a m it does not say before it only states october 31 first in inuktitut
if it was stated in inuktitut then i would agree with the premier
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
yes the translation requires amendment so that it can correlate with the english version
we can deal with that here and we are here to deal with it
the english is clear and self explanatory
the translation should just follow the english version
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
i did a have a question
i want to give other members an opportunity to voice their concerns as well
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i agreed with a single time zone in the previous days
this bill was tabled in april and i agree with all the reasons why this was brought up however today i understand the public s concern
in inuktitut it s literally two hours
we are used to daylight savings time and another hour on top of that the public s perception is that they understood they would move their clock back two hours because they are inuit using traditional knowledge
this is the very first time that we can actually speak to this issue for those of us representing constituents from the baffin region
we were able to discuss this during our member s statements but we were not allowed to ask questions to the issue
for that reason the people are concerned about the fact that they were not involved
they were not even consulted regarding the time change
they have petitioned against it and these petitions were tabled at the house during the official session
many people have signed them
when we went down to item 10 petitions during our tabling of documents item 13 in our orders of the day we were tabling petitions and tabling documents
in regards to this issue these are some of the things that we ve done
perhaps the petitions that came from the baffin are useless
it didn t even last an hour as our clerk had told us that even without the passage of bill 3 our clocks would still turn back
none of the regular members were smiling
all the faces changed drastically
mr irqittuq interpretation
does that mean that the government is going to control the inuit now
is the government never going to consider the concerns of the people
i know that this is going to create a lot of conflict
it s already to started to create conflict with the government
the kitikmeot and keewatin are happy because there s no negative impact with the time change but for those of us who live in the baffin region have felt the impact
and so therefore there s quite a lot of opposition throughout baffin island
if we don t listen to the people of nunavut we re not preparing their future
chairperson interpretation
we have to follow the rules
you cannot as a person in the gallery please be patient
you cannot cheer or do any clapping in the house
please follow the rules accordingly
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
these are the issues i wanted to bring forward
the population of baffin island is the majority of nunavut and when we are given something that we oppose there s room and we have the right to oppose
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
as i have stated before we had set this up through the regulations and we tabled this information out to the public with the authority that was invested in us
i also would like to work with the mayors perhaps it s a bit too late tonight but i would like to discuss this with them tomorrow morning as to how we can proceed with this further
if we didn t change the time it would be going onto 7 00
i just want to remind everybody that we changed our clocks back an hour and i would like to work with all the members when we are consulting with all the communities
we have other issues to deal with too so we should move onto other topics
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
i forgot to mention one of the things we now have one time zone for the whole of nunavut so i know the offices are working a lot better now and we are accommodating them today
nowadays we have high technology
we are not opposing the single time zone for nunavut
igloolik residents and hall beach residents are not opposing the single time zone
one thing that they have been requesting was that the single time zone should have followed the eastern standard time
that way we would have had a unified hour all across nunavut
that was the request in these communities
we would have had less impact with the kitikmeot
keewatin and baffin would have been happy that way
so we do have this high technology
we have better technology than gnwt had
therefore at this time in my community i know that it s the dark season but with this new time change we will be getting dark at noon hour
that s the impact that we are feeling in my community
our school students will be going to school after lunch very dark and it s the middle of winter and it s very cold outside
these are the things that we have to contend with
we understand that we literally moved the time by one hour but it s pretty hard to convince my constituents because they are voicing their concerns
if we go to igloolik they will be reiterating what i m saying
it s pretty hard to convince them
i cannot convince my people personally so i m representing my constituency and that s why i m voicing my concerns
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
perhaps in consideration of the premier has been saying i don t think a different response will be made
i have two more names on my list
i believe you are next mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
his colleagues are probably in the same boat and this is creating a problem
for example our premier is the spokesperson in the media
the qikiqtaaluk inuit are trying to state their views and he s overriding them
as such when he s asked he keeps referring back to the need to experiment and this is seems to be the only response he can give
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
going back to bill 3 the amendments we re talking about the interpretation act
please keep onto the topics
bill 3 mr iqaqrialu was talking about the election process although what you re talking about is really good we have to speak to bill 3 the interpretation act which is an amendment to this act
i would suggest that you keep to the topic
perhaps our premier has another comment to make
do you have a response for mr iqaqrialu comments
hon paul okalik interpretation
i did forget to mention as a committee as a whole we have certain regulations and when you wanted to discuss this issue we did want to deal with it at that time
we did want to discuss it as a whole but we didn t have any time to do so and we did want to further discuss this during our session
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
that would be great
we do want to make changes in the communities that have decided not to go along with the time zone
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
i received a copy and i said earlier that we have to abide by house rules
the individual in the gallery handed me a note apologizing for their actions earlier
thank you
mr nutarak
maybe a last comment
mr nutarak interpretation
bill 3 i was a bit confused
are we finished with this
we have not even voted on this
i just want to end the discussion now
chairperson interpretation
we re just under general comments
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i have no problem with this
we can t help it
it was also mentioned that we can revisit this and review it and i think that would be an appropriate time to do so
i think we know that in the baffin region this is opposed to but maybe we can just start discussing the review and then maybe we could make amendments to the bill
maybe by next year we will be able to ask questions as to which corrections can be made and maybe we ll have a better sense of what the residents in nunavut have on this bill
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
i didn t hear a questions more of a comment
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
mr nutarak did ask a question irrespective of whether we oppose it or not this has already be enacted and enforced
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
we have implemented it
the bill 3 just further clarifies that we have enforced this so we re moving ahead to gain ascent
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier

mr irqittuq interpretation

support for smaller communities
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
there is a newspaper article that talks about our community s deficit
we have to give the smaller communities our full support especially as members of the legislative assembly
the community requires support and assistance especially at the point where they are getting into a deficit
i do not mind this report here but i do not like to see these types of situations especially when the nunavut government is quite new
so we will have to rectify the situation especially with the smaller communities we have to protect all the communities equally

hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to make a member s statement about a special occasion
since this is probably our last day i want to inform you that my father is going to retire this winter
he has been working for the hamlet council i don t know for how long i don t even remember when he first started work
i know some of my colleagues remember when he started working
he is now 78 years old and he is retiring
he has been doing physical work and has been a member of the education council for i don t know how many years but it has been so long i can t remember the date he started
he has been a member since that entity was established and he has been visiting the other communities to talk about religion
mr speaker i know that he doesn t talk about his children or boast about his children but he is always in support of his children so that they can be responsible for themselves
some of his children are in iqaluit toronto winnipeg grise fiord
all of his children are employed because of all the support he has given
he doesn t boast about his children but it is evident that he is very proud of us silently so therefore i stand today to say how proud i am of my father
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
when we were members of the gnwt legislative assembly somebody stated that we should recognize and acknowledge our elders while they are still alive

question 7 - 1 3 annual cost of caribou harvest in coral harbour
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
first of all i would like to apologize that my responses are not translated into inuktitut but the inuktitut translation will be given to the members within 24 hours
mr speaker i would like to respond to a question that was posed on november 2 by the member from qamanittuaq on the annual cost of the caribou harvest in coral harbour
the department provides an annual subsidy of 75 thousand dollars to the coral harbour hunter s and trapper s organization for this hunt
the return on this investment is very good
the community has harvested about 2800 animals per year in the last six years
total revenue for this period was 2 million 53 thousand 947
the annual harvest provides part time work for between 35 to 40 people for a two month period
in dollar terms it has provided 1 million 137 thousand 877 in wages to the community
purchases from local businesses during this period were 359 thousand 441
this is the first year that the federally inspected meat has been purchased by the keewatin fish & meat ltd and this has created 14 new full time positions in rankin inlet
the regional offices of sustainable development are working closely with the community of coral harbour on this year s harvest
the community is hoping to harvest 3500 animals this year

oral questions
question 131 - 1 3
asbestos in baker lake school
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
mr speaker i rise today to talk about an issue that has been long standing in the community of baker lake
when all the members were in the community they had a tour of the jonah amitnak school
i refer to a document in a technical status report that was completed in october of 1996
lo and behold on page 48 of the document there was an article 90 on page 48
the insulation on the heating pipes in the 1957 section which happens to be the oldest school in nunavut if not in the nwt appears to have asbestos content
this was in 1996 mr speaker
we finally get somebody to do a check on what the suspicious insulation was and lo and behold it was discovered to be serpentine asbestos
mr speaker when we hear the word asbestos we often fear the worst in the damage it can do to people
in the last three years we have known that there has been a suspect item in that school
and through no initiative of public works did they go to look at this substance
so we found somebody to look at it and that is what they came back with
i know that there are schools that have asbestos in them but it seems to be a hushed up subject in nunavut
mr speaker i want to ask the minister of education does he have any plans to deal with asbestos in the baker lake school
ma na
speaker
ma na mr mclean
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr speaker
we asked them to look into that amongst other things and there is to be repair work being done on that
however we have the same concerns about the safety issues for the students and we are expecting a more detailed report and from those recommendations we will deal with it definitely
thank you
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
i appreciate the minister s response on it and i know it has been an issue that was brought over from the government of the nwt into the nunavut government
like we have all been saying we are going to be closer to it and deal with these situations quicker
the same people are in rankin inlet that knew about this issue and they don t seem to be moving forward
i know the minister is not responsible for public works but i am responsible for the people in baker lake and he is responsible for all the people in education
ma na

question 132 - 1 3
dewline cleanup
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i was going to ask the minister of community government and transportation however i will go ahead and express my comments with respect to the dew line clean up
there is one site near my community and it has been a long time with no clean up for this site
it is an old site and we are starting to see more contaminants from the erosion that is taking place on this site
also the one in our community the area of contamination is increasing in the damage that it is causing the environment
i would like to see some consideration of what initiatives we can take on
that is my question mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
we have two questions
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in regards to the question and the cleaning up of dew line sites
the department of sustainable development when they are informed about contaminants on the ground usually our staff works on it and assess the complaints
when we are contacted we can ask to have the contaminants cleaned up
i will take your question as notice as to whether we have analyzed it or not
so i will review your question and take it as notice
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr iqaqrialu your question is taken as notice by the minister
oral questions
mr mclean
question 133 - 1 3
inuit teachers in secondary classes
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
i was very pleased to see that the department of education over the last six months has started up the nunavut teacher s education program in rankin inlet and i think they have one in cambridge bay
that s great to try and train more inuit and northern people to take on this important role that i personally feel is one of the most important roles in nunavut the education of our children
we already know that we have a large inuit teacher work force in the primary grades
they have lots of experience most of them are probably the longest serving civil servants in nunavut today
has the minister considered trying to elevate these people from the primary classes up and give them more training so they can teach in the secondary classes
thank you
speaker
ma na mr mclean
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr speaker
yes we have launched an initiative to start high school programs for our ntep students
those teachers already teaching in the classes who want to upgrade their teaching levels to high school have that freedom and option to take further training as high school teachers
that is part of our education for teachers initiative
yes they will have that option
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
oral question mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
on the same question
can the minister explain to me in very brief detail what the initiative is right now thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr speaker
unlike my friend i can be very brief
>>laughter
in order to become a high school teacher you need a special one year course where you take a specific subject like if you want to become a math teacher or a science teacher etc
these are all part of the areas where any teacher who wants to upgrade must identify
with that identification we will have the numbers and work with the university and arctic college together to have these programs planned
but the funding for it has already been approved and we will proceed
speaker
thank you mr arvaluk third supplementary mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
i am very glad and happy to hear that mr minister
so any teacher that is in a primary program right now and wants to upgrade into a secondary end of the school system can just apply after march to the department for educational training and funding
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr speaker
so those are separate and it must be appreciated that they must qualify to teach materials or curriculum that they have been hired to teach
thank you

oral questions
mr puqiqnak
question 134 - 1 3
trades training in arctic college
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister of education
the nunavut arctic college i know that we have basic office training courses but my question is have you initiated other training courses like plumbing drywalling and taping through the arctic college
i was wondering if arctic college has those kinds of training programs
thank you
speaker
thank you mr puqiqnak
minster responsible for education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
for example we do have training programs in fort smith for those types of subjects
we are talking about holding those types of training programs within nunavut
yes they go through the arctic college and the communities
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i thank the minister for his response because in our communities we know and feel that there should be career training programs in the communities of nunavut
we should have training programs for relevant things
for that reason i thank him for the response i know those kinds of training programs are outside of nunavut and we should have those types of programs in nunavut
i expect to have those types of training programs in nunavut because especially my constituency residents that i know of have been working in these areas for a very long time and are very professional
they know how to work as mechanics and so on and they want to train people
nunavut residents want to train their people now therefore i urge the minister and his department to initiate these types of training programs in nunavut
also i would like to tell him that even when the session is not sitting he can approach me and discuss this
speaker interpretation
although i did not hear a question mr puqiqnak mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i did not hear a question either
when he speaks inuktitut i understand what his point was
for those people who have been training on the job in the trades areas we are proud of those people who have worked through these things there are two tests done
in regards to mechanics if they wanted to test in this area they do it on paper and also in physical actual work
i am using a mechanic as an example because they have to change engines annually
if there was a unilingual inuk who did not get official mechanical training that person would still know what to do if they had been working in this trade
i know that if this person looks at this testing he would know right away but if they were unilingual they would have to be taught a week or two
for example the engines change annually and he would have to be brought up to date
but for welding plumbing or carpentry which don t change annually it would be different
but i would like to work with him and discuss these issues as to how we can recognize these kinds of people who do not have official schooling
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
oral questions mr iqaqrialu
question 135 - 1 3
university for nunavut
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have another question to the minister of education
last june during the session i asked a question in regards to a university
we require a university in nunavut so i was wondering if that is a possibility for our territory mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes we have been working on the planning stages for quite some time but it won t be called the university of nunavut
we thought about calling it arctic university
there are quite a few things not done yet and we have to work on this university which may be open for the circumpolar communities not just for nunavut
we would have students from the various countries such as alaska greenland and the other circumpolar countries
the inuit circumpolar conference has been discussing this matter for quite some time and the governments in the different jurisdictions are now working on an agreement
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk

question 136 - 1 3
postal rate increases
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i am not sure whether my question should be directed to the finance minister or the premier once they hear it they can decide who is the appropriate person to answer
mr speaker that effects every single person living in nunavut
mr speaker we always talk about wanting to be treated on the same level with the rest of canada
mr speaker i know that in any other jurisdiction in the south if ratepayers were hit with an increase like that there would be a huge public outcry
mr speaker i would like to ask this government who and how and when will the government be addressing the concerns over this outrageous hike in postage rates

i understand that with this increase this year it will be over 50% in the past two years
to me that is totally unacceptable
where are they getting the surplus from they are getting it from us
i would like to ask the premier if he would convey those types of comments to whoever it is they are going to be lobbying at the federal level
thank you mr speaker

question 138 - 1 3
health board deficits
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question today is directed to the minister responsible for health and social services
mr speaker we have heard in the recent weeks and months of the financial crunch that the minister s department is in
a good portion of this relates to deficits in the health boards
my question to the minister is what plan or scheme does he have in mind to deal with this issue and also what impact are these deficits having on the delivery of health care
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
two question minister responsible for health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
first of all in regards to the deficit i am not pleased with the deficit myself honestly
mr speaker the deficit problem within the board has caused me as the minister of health and indeed our department of health and the board and the staff a lot of concern and stress
coming into nunavut on april 1st as has been related publicly the health boards had an accumulated deficit of 8 9 million dollars
we became aware of that shortly after we came into power and it has gone through analysis in the department

question 140 - 1 3
task force on housing consultation with the smaller communities
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
the minister that i wanted to ask this question to is out of the house but i still have to ask the question so maybe somebody else can reply to it
mr speaker over the last couple of months we have all been discussing the serious lack of housing in nunavut
social housing elders housing and staff housing
we know there is a task force of regular mla s plus some government and private people addressing the situation
mr speaker my question to the minister is will the minister commit that when this task force is addressing the needs of nunavut that they will consult with the smaller communities
when i say the smaller communities mr speaker we seem to forget them sometimes like the grise fiords the resolute bays the arctic bays and clyde rivers and kimmiruts and things like that
will the minister commit to doing community consultations on the task force with these smaller communities
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
i would like to caution the members and ask them not to mention that the ministers are not here
ministers do have other responsibilities throughout nunavut so if you are going to ask a question please do not say the minister is not here that is against our rules

mr mclean
mr mclean
mr speaker we all know that if we had to go out the regular members had to go out and rent a house there is no way that we could afford that
so it distresses me to see that the rents in a community like iqaluit and i don t know about other communities is at that kind of rate of 26 hundred dollars a month
is there any plan by this government to have some kind of rental cap or rental ombudsman to monitor that excessive rents are not being charged or the people being gouged
thank you
speaker
thank you mr mclean
deputy premier mr ng

policy for medical escorts

can the minister tell the house if there is a policy for escorts as they relate to accompanying patients down to the south and if there is a policy what is the policy
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
two questions
minister responsible for health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker first of all we should clarify that escorts are not used only for patients going to the south they are also used to escort people here in nunavut
for example if you re living in the high arctic and you re going to the hospital here in iqaluit you re not going to the south you re going to here in nunavut and there would be an escort provided
in most cases mr speaker where the person may be a teenager or a younger person and there would be travelling outside their home community for medical travel an escort is provided
mr speaker if we have an elderly person or a unilingual person who has to travel outside their home community for medical travel an escort is provided

thank you can you elaborate your question and give your preamble
mr nutarak give your preamble please
mr nutarak interpretation
in pond inlet we have an elder who recently died
he said that if you cannot build a snow house by yourself you are not fit to have a spouse
so that is what i was asking the premier because it falls along with his responsibilities because we have to utilize the request and the needs of the elders
i know my question may sound a bit senseless
i wanted to ask the question of whether he is capable of building a snow house
i know it doesn t really sound sensible

standing committee on culture education and health -report on 1999/2000 six month departmental progress update
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am pleased to table a report on culture education and health for 1999/2000
six month departmental progress updates
standing committee on culture education and health report on six month departmental progress update
introduction
in may of 1999 the standing committees of the legislative assembly of nunavut recommended in the house that government of nunavut departments provide mid-year progress updates to the committees for review
ministers and senior departmental officials appeared before the standing committees from october 14-16 1999
this exercise took place shortly before the opening of the third session of the legislative assembly and the tabling of the bathurst mandate
at the mid-point of the 1999-2000 fiscal year the standing committees were interested in gaining a picture of where the new government stood in terms of spending to date
legislative and policy plans and priorities for the remainder of the fiscal year
staffing progress
and other matters
unfortunately standing committees were again disappointed by the fact that departments were inconsistent in the manner in which materials were provided to committee members
while some departments provided thorough documentation others did not
few departments seemed able or willing to provide materials in advance of ministerial presentations
problems with providing even short documents in both inuktitut and english were evident in some presentations
the standing committee again recommends that departmental materials be provided to members in sufficient advance of appearances to allow for adequate preparation
and that all materials be fully translated
generally speaking the standing committee on culture education and health was pleased with the progress to date made by the three departments under its oversight mandate this report will serve to highlight the standing committee s main observations and concerns
mr speaker our report will be read by the other members of the legislative assembly
mr puqiqnak will be reading the report after me

department of culture language elders and youth
the honourable donald havioyak minister of culture language elders and youth appeared before the standing committee on october 14 1999
mid-year fiscal position
the standing committee was disappointed that no documents detailing the mid-year financial status of the department were provided
new organizational chart
the standing committee noted recent changes in several of the key staff positions during the summer but also observed that a lot had been accomplished in the last few months
the committee is concerned that the department is only 25% staffed with 12 positions trying to accomplish a very broad mandate
the committee is pleased to hear that a new senior finance person assisted in the development of the new organizational chart which was being presented to cabinet for final approval
in terms of decentralization the minister advised that part of the language division was being moved from cambridge bay to kugluktuk
the minister advised that staff in cambridge bay had been given notice of relocation and that the 9 positions allocated to kugluktuk now have housing and office space available to them
the standing committee encourages the department to fill its outstanding positions as quickly as possible
preservation revitalization and provision of inuktitut/inuinnaqtun language
in its may report the standing committee had urged the creation of language policies to outline how language services are to be accessed as well as other matters
the standing committee is concerned that no update was provided and observed that difficulties seem to be encountered in providing effective and timely translation services from igloolik
the minister apologized for not having inuktitut translations of his opening remarks due to technical difficulties in sending the completed translations to iqaluit exacerbated by a shortage of computers in igloolik with e-mail capabilities
the standing committee is sympathetic and understands that more interpreter/translators will be put into place
it is clear that the language division put a lot of effort into ensuring that the other departmental presentations were translated and much of this work had to be done at the last minute
however it points to the need for required timelines for other departments to provide original material to be translated which would be part of a language policy
this policy should reinforce the needs of the standing committees to ultimately receive materials well in advance of the hearing dates as discussed above
the standing committee reiterates its recommendations at page 20 in its may 1999 report
however the committee continues to push for inuktitut language training programs to be taught by elders to our youth
official languages agreement the standing committee was concerned that this intergovernmental agreement had not yet been signed with the federal government for this fiscal year
the deputy minister noted that the problem was the share allocated to nunavut $2 8m is not sufficient to meet our needs in both french and aboriginal languages
nevertheless it appears that the government of nunavut will sign the current agreement without changes and try to negotiate for changes for the coming year in the winter
the standing committee would like to receive more detail on this agreement and its scope
the standing committee is concerned at the lack of sufficient funding for translation and interpretation
they are also concerned at the overall lack of funding for instruction in inuktitut and inuinnaqtun in the schools and want to know how this agreement could be used to help secure funds for this purpose
the standing committee recommends that sufficient funding be secured to translate all nunavut legislation into inuktitut and inuinnaqtun
nunavut territorial archives and heritage
the committee looks forward to hearing more about the repatriation of historical artifacts to nunavut from other parts of canada and the world
the standing committee was also pleased to hear that the department was moving forward with plans for a heritage centre and an archival facility
however the members have some concern about a heritage facility being located in igloolik which might not be accessible to very many residents or visitors
members are very concerned that communities be given the capacity to house their own heritage items and they wish to hear more about how heritage facilities or displays will be established in each of the communities
the standing committee would like to receive more detail on the proposed heritage centre and archival facility and reiterates its recommendation at page 21 of its may 1999 report
nunavut arts council
the standing committee noted that there were recent newspaper advertisements inviting public consultation regarding the nunavut arts council
members expressed their desire to receive copies of the consultation documents
the standing committee recommends that the nunavut arts council provide one-stop funding information for all funding available to nunavut artists musicians and cultural workers
inuit qaujimajatuqangit
the standing committee looks forward to receiving a copy at the end of this month of the report and the recommendations that emerged from the workshop
inuit place names
the standing committee recommends that the department work in co-ordination with inuit organizations to provide funding and support to communities to assist them in inuit place names projects
elders
the standing committee is concerned that a senior advisor for elders has not yet been hired and that no concrete action has taken place to provide part-time staff support to elders councils at the community or nunavut wide level
members are concerned that efforts be undertaken as soon as possible to obtain the legends and songs from the elders
as well members continue to wish for programs that will allow elders to be able to teach the youth about the language and the culture of the inuit and the traditions
the minister committed to ensuring that there will be easy to access forms in inuktitut and inuinnaqtun and the deputy minister stated that staff will help elders fill out any application forms for funding
however it was not clear if in fact there is funding for this purpose
the standing committee strongly reiterates its recommendations at pages 6 and 22 of the may 1999 report
youth
the standing committee was pleased to hear that the senior advisor for youth began in august and is consulting with regional youth conferences to set priorities for youth in nunavut
as well the minister noted that a canada wide youth conference will be held in iqaluit in january 2000
the standing committee looks forward to hearing the results of these meetings and the department s plans for youth
women s issues/ status of women s council
the standing committee is very supportive of the creation of a women s council which will be truly representative and accountable to the women of nunavut
the standing committee supports the department s preferred option for the appointment of an interim council for one year to establish a permanent structure and organization and looks forward to hearing options for the permanent structure
members note that women in the communities of nunavut would be more empowered if they were to select their own representatives to this body
persons with disabilities
the standing committee heartily supports the direction of the department to help people with disabilities live meaningful lives in our communities instead of institutions outside of nunavut and looks forward to receiving more detail on this work
that is where i will conclude mr speaker thank you

minister arvaluk appeared before the standing committee on october 14 1999
mid-year fiscal position
the standing committee was disappointed that no documents detailing the mid-year financial status of the department were provided
inuit teacher education and leadership program
the standing committee was pleased to hear that an amount of $1 5 million had been approved for this important program which the committee had supported and recommended in its may 1999 report
the dissolution of the district education councils
the standing committee was updated on the planning for the restructuring of the three education councils
the committee was pleased to hear that the councils are being consulted and that a broader review of the education act is being undertaken at the same time by the department to make it more relevant to nunavut
members are aware of the consultation on education principles currently underway by the minister
it was noted that the departmental staff were beginning the drafting process in inuktitut which will later be translated into english
as well members were advised that the organizational design is expected by december 1999 and this will be tabled in the house
the standing committee is pleased that the minister proposes to change the act to place more responsibility and resources at the community level and looks forward to hearing more details of how that is proposed to happen
the committee continues to reiterate its recommendation at page 10 of the may 1999 report
that the government of nunavut strengthen community empowerment provide more authority at the community level on education issues and present very clear plans as to how this will happen under the departmental control
nursing program
the standing committee was also pleased to see the new nunavut nursing program being delivered through nunavut arctic college which the committee supported and recommended in its may 1999 report
[see department of health and social services]
staffing/ decentralization
the standing committee was updated on staffing and was pleased to hear that the department is reaching its inuit employment targets in their plan
however members had some concerns about the decentralized positions particularly the delay in moving the nunavut arctic college positions designated for arviat and some question of reluctance of some staff as reported in the media
the standing committee encourages the department to move quickly in concert with the department of public works and the decentralization secretariat to secure office space and housing so that these decentralized positions can be established
research projects and studies
the standing committee was advised that a number of requests for proposals were in process which will review a number of key issues 5 year labour force needs analysis 10 year curriculum strategic plan
languages of instruction
school funding review
and college funding review
members noted again their own observations that local people need to learn practical skills that are needed often in their communities such as construction and drywall taping
the standing committee looks forward to receiving updates on this research
strategic issues in education
the standing committee received a briefing of some of the critical issues that the department is facing in trying to develop a more relevant education system for nunavut
the effort by the department to understand the impacts of these issues and to analyze trends is appreciated
the standing committee commends the thorough approach being undertaken by this department
capital plan
the standing committee was advised that the 20-year capital plan has been initiated
members asked about the total capital projects projected in the business plan and the proportion applied for capital projects currently underway legal requirements and health safety and statutory obligations
members were advised that effectively the capital plan currently in place was the 5-year capital plan inherited from the gnwt and it is being reviewed annually in nunavut
these matters should have come to the standing committee as part of the capital plan
the government has stated that all of the communities should be treated equitably but there appears to be special treatment here
the standing committee looks forward to a full discussion of the department s capital projects in the upcoming capital plan consultations for the government of nunavut
other education initiatives
the standing committee was updated on a number of other initiatives including the millennium scholarship foundation which provides $212 000 each year to nunavut and $60 000 to administer the program as well as a number of other intergovernmental agreements
members were pleased to see that there would be 76 scholarships of $3 000 each which will be prioritized based on need
members were concerned whether this will be enough funds to meet the needs of all of the students wishing to further their education
the standing committee is interested in receiving more information on the criteria for these scholarships and departmental estimates of the number of students in need of financial support
children with special needs
members continue to have concerns about special needs students and the lack of strategies or plans for persons with disabilities including physical mental and learning disabilities
members observed that children with disabilities do not have a voice - they cannot make proposals or requests
members want these children to have the tools to give them as much opportunity as possible for a good future
members would like to see a school for students with disabilities so that they don t have to leave nunavut to go to schools that will meet their needs
members were advised that the department is reviewing this matter and surveying students with disabilities being trained in other provinces
the standing committee looks forward to receiving an update on the planning process for students with disabilities and strongly encourages the department to address the gaps in this area
housing for teachers
members expressed concern about the lack of housing for teachers in many of the communities
the minister noted that at present the issue of housing for teachers is in the jurisdiction of the district education councils
however he noted that the more inuit and local teachers are trained and hired the less housing will be a problem since local people usually have housing or would be interested in purchasing their own home
members observed that the lack of affordable housing is one of the reasons why people don t come to work in some of the communities as teachers and this problem will be in the jurisdiction of the department next year
the standing committee recommends that the department of education work together with hamlet councils the housing authorities local businesses and teachers to set aside a few units to ensure that teachers will have housing in the interim
the government of nunavut should also look at putting aside some staff housing for teachers
in those communities where affordability is an issue the committee recommends that the department look at whether giving teachers a larger subsidy would help
income security
the standing committee supports the department s move from dependency to self-reliance through income support and looks forward to receiving the results of the income support policy review now underway by the department of education
department of health and social services
minister picco appeared before the standing committee on october 14 1999
mid-year fiscal position - the deficits of the health boards
the standing committee was pleased to receive documents detailing the mid-year financial status of the department
however the detail was focused primarily on the deficit of the health boards and the projected deficit for the department
members were given a detailed briefing which provided a historical analysis of underfunding of the regional health boards in nunavut under the previous gnwt which has been carried into the nunavut budget
the briefing highlighted the fact that health and social services in nunavut receives less proportionate funding of the total budget than in any other provincial or territorial government
this despite the fact that additional costs of providing health and social services in nunavut are even more expensive than elsewhere in canada due to patient travel and care providers
these factors have contributed to the deficit of the regional health boards
members hope that the dissolution of the health boards and the integration of these services into the department of health and social services will help ensure that some of the wastage will be checked by the government of nunavut
nevertheless the question remains of how to pay for the deficits
the deficits of the previous fiscal year must be absorbed by the entire government of nunavut as determined under the assets and liabilities agreement with the gnwt
the standing committee recommends that any surplus in the assets carried over to nunavut from the gnwt be applied first to the liability of the inherited deficit of $8 9million for the health boards from the previous fiscal year
any remaining deficit should be offset by any surplus of the government of nunavut which may occur across all of the departments due to the fact that not all positions were in place for the entire fiscal year
the standing committee supports the overall goal of applying any surplus towards new housing stock as a goal which will positively affect the health of nunavummiut
as to the current fiscal year the regional health boards and the department must be encouraged to take more responsibility now so that their deficit situation is minimised
departmental finance staff should work closely with the regional health boards and their executive directors to ensure a sincere effort to keep within budget
the minister acknowledged that one area where the costs for health care are driven upwards is through the use of temporary nursing contracts
these are expensive contracts paid on an hourly rate to agencies in addition to all transportation and accommodation costs
in addition temporary nurses often increase the amount of medical travel as they tend to refer patients to the larger facilities
the minister spoke of new retention initiatives being undertaken by the department and focus-group discussions which will be taking place in several communities
nevertheless the difficulties in recruiting new nurses were underlined by the fact that the department recently had to go as far as australia to recruit nine new nurses for nunavut
the standing committee supports the retention initiatives currently being undertaken and further requests detailed information on the costs associated with temporary nursing positions
a new direction for the department - promotion of health and prevention of illness
the department provided detailed information on health status indicators and critical issues that must be overcome if we are to achieve healthy communities in nunavut
the standing committee encourages this direction
nevertheless the committee is concerned that the approach envisioned seems to be one of hiring more professionals from the south rather than one of community empowerment
for example the goal for the department at the community level is 1 community health nurse for every 200 people and 1 social worker for every 300 people
there are many models of care delivery that involve the public more and the standing committee does not believe that enough effort has been given to them in the past in nunavut
members noted that if there was consistent staff support for a community health committee members of the committee could go on local radio and participate in health promotion activities
similarly a good community wellness worker can help the community organize itself to deliver a range of services to children youth and families much of which promotes healthy living and community service
historically inuit had to provide many of these services for each other and we need to reinvigorate this knowledge and experience
mental health
the standing committee is particularly concerned with the need for more preventative and proactive approaches in the area of mental health particularly as it relates to suicide prevention family break-up family violence and other forms of abuse
members observe that mental health workers coming from the south are not as aware of the needs of the community as they should be
members also observed that there is heavy reliance on drugs prescribed by visiting doctors or to patients who have been sent out of the community
this does not always work as there is not always support for follow-up in the community
members want to see mental health workers incorporating both inuit qaujimajatuqangit and a good knowledge of inuit language and culture with a specialized knowledge of mental health skills
members feel that there are people in their communities who are capable of learning mental health skills and delivering these services
members also feel the need for both male and female mental health workers in their communities
at the same time members recognize that a holistic approach should include both physical and mental health
the standing committee recommends that the department take a new approach to mental health which integrates inuit qaujimajatuqangit and more community involvement in the delivery of mental health programs
community wellness
the standing committee was advised that the department is trying to take a lead role in co-ordinating the various funding initiatives from several departments that fall under the broad heading of wellness
in some communities wellness co-ordinators work for the hamlets and in the baffin they are part of the regional inuit association
members were advised that the community wellness co-ordinators will play a role in the community level health decision-making the standing committee is encouraged by this development
members were also advised that the community health representatives chrs will also play a role in the community level health decision making along with the nurses and social workers
members observe that at times chrs become secretaries interpreters liaison and have very little time to do health promotion or prevention work
members would like to see the role of the chr clarified and they note that if the chrs were under the hamlet councils they could promote wellness in the community better
members note that both the community wellness co-ordinator and the chr s could provide support to the community health committees
the standing committee recommends the development of co-ordinated community-based decision making in conjunction with the community health committees and looks forward to receiving more information on this model
dissolution of the regional health boards
the standing committee was pleased to hear that consultants have met with the people in keewatin baffin and the kitikmeot and that an implementation co-ordinator is in place
while no timetable was presented it appears that the planning is continuing on schedule to unify the administrative structure with the participation and involvement of the regional health boards
as well the department is consulting with the 26 communities in nunavut
members were advised the community health committees such as the one in kimmirut are the model for focusing community concern
if one is not in place then the department is looking at a process of talking to the mayors to see if a health subcommittee could be established under the local elected hamlet
the standing committee recommends that some of the authority and power of the health boards be given to the community health committees especially in the area of health promotion
it is crucial that staff support be given so that the community health committees can be effective

nunavut nursing program
the standing committee was very pleased to see the nunavut nursing program up and running in september in iqaluit
the committee earnestly hopes the program succeeds and is a model for training other health care providers in nunavut
the standing committee recommends that the department and the college put extra effort into ensuring that the students successfully complete the program and looks forward to receiving updates on the program
capital plan
the minister advised that a departmental capital plan had been initiated to deal with the needs for renovation of existing facilities and the need for new ones
members raised some concerns about the p3 funding process and the prospect of expensive long term commitments as well as the potential difficulties in staffing these facilities given the current difficulties in staffing health centres
the minister advised that a consultant has been hired to do a program operational review of the p3 projects which will do a cost analysis
this will be presented to cabinet
the standing committee recommends that any p3 financed projects be reviewed by members in the same manner as any other capital projects prior to their final approval
standing committee on community empowerment and sustainable development - report on the 1999/2000 six month departmental progress update
introduction
in may of 1999 the standing committees of the legislative assembly of nunavut recommended in the house that government of nunavut departments provide mid-year progress updates to the committees for review
ministers and senior departmental officials appeared before the standing committees from october 14-16 1999
this exercise took place shortly before the opening of the third session of the legislative assembly and the tabling of the bathurst mandate
at the mid-point of the 1999-2000 fiscal year the standing committees were interested in gaining a picture of where the new government stood in terms of spending to date
legislative and policy plans and priorities for the remainder of the fiscal year
staffing progress
and other matters
unfortunately standing committees were again disappointed by the fact that departments were inconsistent in the manner in which materials were provided to committee members
while some departments provided thorough documentation others did not
few departments seemed able or willing to provide materials much in advance of ministerial presentations
problems with providing even short documents in both inuktitut and english were evident in some presentations
the standing committee again recommends that departmental materials be provided to members in sufficient advance of appearances to allow for adequate preparation
and that all materials be fully translated
generally speaking the standing committee on community empowerment and sustainable development was satisfied with the progress to date made by the four departments under its oversight mandate
this report will serve to highlight the standing committee s main observations and concerns
department of justice
minister anawak appeared before the committee on october 15 1999
legislative drafting
the committee strongly supports efforts by the department to ensure that full inuktitut and innuinaqtun translations of all bills are prepared
the committee recommends that this initiative be extended to other core justice materials such as the nunavut gazette
cross-cultural sensitivity training for rcmp and corrections staff
members of the committee were pleased to learn of the recent successful graduation of several inuit rcmp cadets
the committee is of the view that that there is a need for better cross-cultural training to be provided to non-inuit members of the rcmp and corrections staff
the committee is also of the view that the department has an important role to play in working with federal counterparts in this regard
the committee recommends that the department follow up on this issue
departmental spending to date
the minister indicated that he anticipated that the department would conclude the fiscal year with a surplus although no specific figures were provided
the surplus is primarily a result of not all positions being staffed
corrections planning committee
the minister indicated that the report of the cpc would be submitted to the minister shortly
the standing committee looks forward to receiving a copy of the report
members of the committee in their discussions with the minister emphasized the need for much greater emphasis on programs that genuinely emphasize rehabilitation and healing as opposed to simple warehousing of offenders
the committee is of the view that corrections is an area in which inuit qaujimajatuqangit can be of great help in program design and delivery
members of the committee also expressed concern over the issue of youth incarceration and encourage the minister to pursue solutions that work to support healthy families
the committee reiterates its support for the use of on-the-land camps
community justice committees
the minister indicated that officials will be working with the crown the rcmp and cjcs on a diversion policy
the standing committee reiterates its support for movement in this area
the committee also recommends that the department work to ensure that cjcs in all regions have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities
law review commission maligarnit qimirrujiit
the minister indicated that departmental staff will be assigned to support the work of the commission
the committee is supportive of this important initiative and expressed its desire to see it play a part in fostering fundamental reform to the justice system as a whole making it more reflective of inuit values
community government and transportation
minister anawak appeared before the committee on october 15 1999
airport capital assistance program
the minister indicated that discussions between the department and the federal government were progressing well
the standing committee is supportive of the minister s efforts in this area
safety standards and emergency response
the minister indicated that departmental officials were working to ensure equitable safety standards and emergency services would apply across nunavut
the standing committee is supportive of this policy direction
search and rescue
members of the committee indicated to the minister that situations continue to arise on the land and at outpost camps in which confusion between the responsibilities of sar and medevac are evident
the standing committee recommends that the departments of cgt and hss work to resolve the issue
and that adequate funding be provided for sar operations
community empowerment
the minister indicated that the department plans to hold consultations with mayors and the nunavut association of municipalities to discuss such issues as block funding and transfer of responsibilities
members of the committee recommend that transfer of responsibilities to communities be accompanied by adequate resources
minister thompson appeared before the committee on october 15 1999
housing
the minister advised the standing committee that hiring is in progress for a new president of the housing corporation
the minister also indicated that the work of the minister s task force on housing would commence shortly
two members of the standing committee serve on the task force
in keeping with the bathurst mandate s commitment to making housing one of the government of nunavut s two primary commitments
and while recognizing and supporting the potential for the minister s task force to make a valuable contribution to housing policy reform
the committee nonetheless continues to recommend that the minister make every effort to secure additional resources from any government-wide surplus during the current fiscal year to purchase materials for housing construction to start in the year 2000
review of contracting regulations and the nunavut business incentive policy
the minister indicated that a departmental working group is in the process of conducting a review these issues in consultation with nti
and to continue to push to ensure that the government deals with these issues in a spirit of genuine commitment to article 24 and the principles of transparency and fairness
internet access for small communities
the standing committee was pleased to learn of progress being made in connecting nunavut communities to the internet the committee recommends that smaller communities not be ignored in this respect
the committee expressed its support for the department s breaking down of large construction contracts into smaller components so that smaller nunavut companies have a better opportunity to compete utilizing appropriate designs and technologies in construction
members of the committee expressed their desire for the department to better use local knowledge and nunavut-appropriate designs and technologies in construction and other projects
members take note that the department has recently called for expressions of interest for public housing design concepts
department of sustainable development
minister kilabuk appeared before the committee on october 16
mining sector
the minister outlined some recent departmental initiatives including the signing of a geoscience accord with the federal government and the prospectors program
the committee recommends that the department place strong emphasis in its planning to be prepared for significant increases in mining activity over the next few years in nunavut
and that efforts be made in conjunction with relevant stakeholders to provide training programs for residents of the territory to secure employment in this sector
one window approach
the minister indicated that the department is continuing to work towards a one window approach for support to small business
while supportive of this initiative in principle the committee recommends that the approach be developed in such a way as to greatly improve the present level of accountability for public funds and the transparency of funding policy
the committee further recommends that greater emphasis on effective follow-up support and advice for funding recipients be made
relations with other jurisdictions
the committee reiterates its support for the minister s efforts to secure a fair deal for nunavut in such areas as fishing quotas
and for the minister s efforts to negotiate an mou on economic development with the government of canada
arts and crafts sector
members of the standing committee recommend that the department continue to pursue innovative ways of supporting the arts and crafts sector
including support to carving associations and ways to ensure the ready availability of carving materials in communities

mr puqiqnak would you like to respond
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
mr chairman the nunavut arts council they are called naca nunavut arts council association and we also considered the fact that the artists do get funding from the federal government
we do have heritage funds in ottawa and every spring usually the carvers have a festival in inuvik
we were wondering if we could have similar programs in nunavut and have our own nunavut arts council association
this entity would be able to provide one stop funding as we do have funding sources from the federal government
the ottawa inuit art foundation supplies some funding to nunavut when they ask for it and they bring inuit people down there to carve
if we have our own nunavut arts council we can generate more income in nunavut
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
perhaps just in addition to that i would like to see some sort of document outlining this issue
i apologize all of the details are in the standing committee reports we are just reading the recommendations right now

good afternoon members of the legislative assembly invited guests ladies and gentlemen
interpretation ends we are resuming the third session of the first legislative assembly of nunavut
today is an historic day
it is the first sitting of the legislative assembly to take place outside of iqaluit
on behalf of all the members of the house i would like to extend our warmest thanks to the people of rankin inlet for the gracious welcome that you have extended to us
interpretation also i would like to recognize the people who worked very hard to put this together so that we would be fully prepared for our sitting
i would like to recognize the youth who worked hard to get us going
interpretation ends i would like to thank the students and teachers of maani ulujuk school for allowing us the use of your school
special recognition is due to lizzie ittinuar our sergeant at arms for this week
in carrying the mace the traditional symbol of legislative authority lizzie also embodies the strength of our elders and our heritage
we have been looking forward to sitting here for some months now and it is a testament to the spirit of this community to see the chamber so full today
interpretation today before we go to the orders of the day i would like to read the remarks sent to us by the commissioner of nunavut
it says

item 2
ministers statements
minister s statement 41 - 1 3 decentralization update
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
first of all before i start i would like to thank you all to the people that are here in the house
i am very glad to see that there are a lot of people here interested in seeing the sittings
thank you
mr speaker i wish to inform members and bring them up to date on decentralization activities and progress towards our commitment to relocate government operations and employees to various communities throughout nunavut
interpretation ends decentralization continues to be a priority for those who planned and designed this government a priority of all mlas elected to this assembly
the decentralization secretariat was formally established under the department of the executive & intergovernmental affairs in september 1999
leona aglukkaq was appointed as the assistant deputy minister for the decentralization section of our department
interpretation our intent has been to achieve full decentralization over a three year timeframe and the allocation of the budget for the upcoming fiscal year indicates this government s commitment to making decentralization a reality in our communities
interpretation ends mr speaker as i have mentioned in the past the implementation of decentralization is an important step in the development of nunavut
but it is equally important that decentralization is implemented in the most efficient and cost effective manner possible
a planned approach will not only ensure programs and services are not interrupted during departmental relocation but will maximize future benefits for nunavummiut
therefore the decentralisation secretariat has taken a detailed approach to planning
this has involved reviewing any critical shortage in housing and office space determining requirements for furnishings and systems planning for training and preparation for new recruitment
the planning is ongoing and circumstances are continuing to change
advanced planning and costing is part of the larger objective of ensuring decentralization occurs without waste
the government of nunavut is committed to efficiency in government and this applies to decentralization
the decentralization secretariat is committed to analyzing costs and trying to minimize these costs wherever possible
the decentralization secretariat is also committed to supporting the departments that will be relocated and in this process of assisting each department will develop customised plans to assist in their moves
these plans will look at all the logistics involved ensuring there is minimal disruption to programs and services during the implementation phase
interpretation mr speaker the benefits that decentralization can bring to our communities are many in addition to stimulating the local economy of each decentralized community it presents a unique opportunity to maximise employment and training opportunities
interpretation ends while the success of decentralization depends on having trained
personnel available in these communities it is also true that local training will be more effective with the local community presence of government departments
this means that individuals will not have to leave their community to participate in public service training opportunities
the training that is provided to these individuals will not only lead to government employment but will make many other opportunities available to them
once trained they may wish to be employed outside of the government and even outside their community
in any event the benefits and opportunities decentralization can provide through training are many and will be maximized through the further development of training plans by the government in co-operation with the impacted communities
interpretation mr speaker i am pleased to inform the members that a portion of this year s decentralization budget has been targeted at local training initiatives
this shows our commitment not only to making decentralization happen but to maximize its benefits
interpretation ends the first year of our training plan will initiate on the job training and the number of community training and employment opportunities will increase each year as decentralization continues to be implemented
mr speaker it is indicative of our commitment to decentralization that a specific budget allocation required to implement decentralization in the coming fiscal year has been recommended for approval
this budget will be sufficient to implement about one third of our overall decentralization objective
mr speaker decentralization is a key objective of our government and one that this government will ensure happens as planned within three years
thank you mr speaker

thank you mr premier mr okalik
ministers statements mr premier
minister s statement 42 - 1 3 visual identity program
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
earlier today i was pleased to unveil the new logo for the government of nunavut
this logo will be used to identify the government in our territory across canada and throughout the world
interpretation ends it is difficult to choose just one symbol to represent a land and people as diverse as nunavut
this symbol represents the unity of our territory
it reflects the pride in the traditions of nunavut and these traditions are a foundation for our government as it moves forward to improve the lives of nunavummiut
interpretation the artists who developed our logo andrew qappik and dan o brien spoke with many people about what they would like to see in our logo
mr speaker some people in this room contributed to that discussion
interpretation ends our logo is a polar bear standing on a mound of snow looking up and back to the north star niqirtsituk as you know niqirtsituk was used as a traditional guide for navigation
the north star is also included in the designs of the nunavut flag and coat of arms
interpretation the polar bear is moving forward towards a more prosperous nunavut while looking back into the past acknowledging the traditions of the inuit way of life and the teachings of the elders
interpretation ends mr speaker the pages are delivering to each member a souvenir of the occasion
i hope you will all enjoy this gift
interpretation i also want to take this opportunity to thank andrew and dan for their hard work and creativity
there will be a feast tonight to celebrate our new logo and honour our artists
i encourage everyone to participate in this celebration
thank you mr speaker

ministers statements
mr kilabuk
minister s statement 43 - 1 3 program partnerships
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker when our new government was formed on april 1 1999 we took steps to ensure programs delivered to the public would not be interrupted
our first year of delivering these programs has given us an opportunity to see what programs are working and the effectiveness of our delivery
it has also given us the opportunity to speak with members of this house and our program partners on where changes and improvements need to be made
in fact when i appeared before the standing committee on community empowerment and sustainable development october 1999 this topic was on their mind as well
they asked me to examine approaches to program delivery that improve the accountability and transparency of their operations
mr speaker the department of sustainable development delivers its programs through four levels of partnerships
first we work in partnership with hamlets in delivering community economic development services in communities
second we work in partnership with outside organizations who deliver other business programs such as partners in development in this region
third we work in partnership with industry associates such as nunavut tourism and the nunavut arts and crafts association
finally we work in partnership with the government of canada such as through the canada / nunavut geoscience office
but we have determined that that there must be clearer terms and conditions to many of these partnerships in order that i can report back to this house on the performance of our programs
mr speaker i would like to advise the house today that my department of sustainable development intends to introduce a new policy on our program partnerships on 2000/2001
this policy will provide a clear framework on how we intend to fund our partnerships the terms under which we are partnering our programs and our expected performance and reporting standards
i am pleased to say that we have now sent information on the new department of sustainable development to all mayors in nunavut
we have also recently completed a simple program brochure which identifies which people to contact in communities and at the regional level about our program information
and also mr speaker i m examining methods of how we can support and develop the skill level of the community economic development officers who are funded by this government through a partnership agreement with hamlets
i expect to report on progress on this early in the new fiscal year
mr speaker this government through the bathurst mandate made a commitment to simplify and enhance access to our programs
the changes i have detailed today are the first phase of continued improvements to program delivery that you can expect from the department of sustainable development
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk ministers statements
mr arvaluk
minister s statement 44 - 1 3 integration of school services
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker first of all representing the mothers and fathers i would like to thank them for our students
mr speaker i submitted a progress report on the dissolution of divisional education councils to the standing committee on education culture and health in february of this year
however i think it is important for all members to be aware of what is happening with this project so i will provide you with a verbal update
in addition i would be pleased to share my written report to any interested member
interpretation ends the integration of school services with the department of education will bring our department closer to nunavummiut
following a decision to dissolve the divisional education councils in the spring of 1999 legislation was passed and work began in may to start the process of change
the team doing the work consisted of staff from both headquarter and board offices
we made a special effort to involve inuit staff in the decision making
i briefed the nunavut social development council and we also had two meetings with the board chairs to inform them of the change and to brief them on progress
i also met with each full divisional council at least once in the last 10 months
it will be critical for us to set up an effectively functioning administrative operation in each region reporting to an assistant deputy minister at headquarters
the newly designed organizations will not look a lot different than the existing board operations
however by july 1 2000 they will no longer be at arms length form the nunavut government
they will use the government s central agency services and will conform to government policies in all areas
interpretation ends i am pleased to report that the new organization design is complete and all staff in board offices received job offers by early december
they now understand their roles in the new organization
we succeeded in fulfilling the governments promise that there would be no layoffs and this has really reduced anxiety levels amongst staff
i am confident that we now have the resources in place to make the transition on time in july of this year
the department predicted savings of 1 million dollars through the dissolution of the boards of management
i am confident we will meet that target
we have been able to achieve significant savings through the elimination of board per diems and travel costs
we will also save money through staff reductions made possible through the use of central agency services
these savings will be phased in over a number of months starting at the beginning of the 2000/2001 school year
interpretation mr speaker we still have a lot work to do make this project a success
however we are a bit ahead of schedule and i have no doubt that this important change will proceed on time within budget
the dissolution of the divisional education councils and the integration of these services into the department will move the department of education and the minister of education closer to our students and all nunavummiut

i had planned to make this statement yesterday but predictably the unpredictable rankin weather had pushed us back a day
some things will never change
as members of this house know i had the honour of serving on the hamlet council in 96 and 97 with a number of very able colleagues some of whom i see in the gallery today
it has been a tremendous feeling to see so many old friends and family over the last few days although iqaluit is my home this community will always have a special place in my heart

member s statement 80 - 1 3 appreciation for sessional assistance
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we are very happy and proud to be here
if i could just make a comment in the 1960 s and 1970 s when the nunavut settlements and the hamlets were being put in place we never expected to have this actual nunavut government
at least now we have established the nunavut government and there are some things that we didn t expect that are happening today
we see drum dancing in the legislative assembly we see a qulliq being lit and the young children singing o canada in inuktitut
these are all things that we should be proud of and that the elders are here too
so on behalf of each and every one of them i would like to thank them and i would also like to acknowledge the pages for a week
i would like to thank them elaine bruce alurak and codie dean tupa ford amie kuludjak joanne kent and laura mary
these are our pages for this week
i would also like to acknowledge as i have stated before we see things that we did not expect to see
as the person who opened the meeting with a prayer said this is the first time that the mace was carried by a woman into the legislature
lizzie ittinuar who is the sergeant at arms i know that all of the nunavut residents recognize her but she has worked very hard to maintain the traditional clothing
i don t think we recognize her for all her work to enhance keep and preserve traditional clothing
i was very proud of her carrying the mace
i would also like to welcome the members and we are very glad and proud to welcome you to rankin inlet

i am very pleased that we can at least reach the year 2000 without any real problem in nunavut

also elders are now dying off and our young people are increasing in numbers
our elders should teach our young people how to live a traditional way of life in the year 2000 which i expect to see
i would like to encourage our young people to ask questions of the elders that way they can have a better idea about life as to how we have lived and survived from the past to date

size of housing lots
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
i have a number of returns to oral questions
one question was asked by mr iqaqrialu on november 3 1999 regarding the distance between houses
the size of housing lots is normally determined as a result of hamlet zoning by-laws
smaller hamlets use a land use planning process in lieu of specific zoning requirements
another factor which dictates distances between houses is the fire separation regulations
if an individual is accessing a home ownership program through the housing corporation or for that matter building on their own they can discuss the position of the house with their building contractor prior to construction

aviation fuel in repulse bay and pelly bay
hon manitok thompson interpretation
mr speaker this is a return to an oral question asked by mr alakannuark on november 3 1999 in regards to concerns about a lack of aviation fuel in repulse bay and pelly bay
as soon as we heard about this concern during the summer of 1999 we brought 12 drums of certified aviation fuel into repulse bay at the request of the member for emergency use and for medivacs
at the time of this response none of the product has been used and no complaints have been received
also we have not received any complaints from the airlines in reference to the community of pelly bay either
we have completed an analysis of the costs to provide certified aviation fuel in pelly bay which would include proper storage piping and distribution facilities
preliminary estimates are in the millions of dollars depending on the options chosen

dew line clean up
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to make a response to a question that was asked at the last session
the question was brought up by mr iqaqrialu regarding the dew line cleanup sites
following the last session i sent a letter to member iqaqrialu as well as all members of the legislative assembly which detailed the status of clean ups at all sites in nunavut
mr speaker i would like to advise the house that environmental assessments have been completed for all 39 dew line sites
indian and northern affairs canada and the department of national defence are both using restoration procedures that ensure that the level of clean up meets acceptable clean up standards and guidelines
the department of national defence is committed to monitoring the landfill sites following clean up
mr speaker my department s environmental protection services maintains close contact with officials in both the department of national defence and indian affairs
they also review and provide input into proposals that are submitted by consultants chosen to carry out clean up activities at the dew line sites
in my correspondence to members i detailed the schedule and status of clean up operations at every dew line site and i am tabling this information in the house today
i would like to assure mr iqaqrialu that his concern surrounding the clean up of these sites is being closely monitored by my officials

economic agreement with echo bay mines
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker i left my mike on
today i would like to make a reply to a question that was brought up by the member for iqaluit centre in regards to echo bay mines
this information was also contained in a letter to mr tootoo sent after the last session
as members are aware echo bay mines have announced the reopening of the lupin mine and officials in my department have been in discussion with mine officials about ensuring that employment and business impacts fall to nunavut
the kitikmeot inuit association is also working with echo bay to ensure that there are linkages made to the labour force and business community in the kitikmeot
however mr speaker there are no binding agreements requiring echo bay to employ residents of the northwest territories or nunavut
on the question of whether employees at the lupin mine from outside nunavut will pay personal income tax in nunavut this is determined by revenue canada on the basis of their principle residence
therefore an employee at the lupin mine whose family and home are in alberta would pay income tax in alberta

baker lake freezer
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
so that i don t have to keep standing up i have four responses for returns to oral questions and i will cover them all
one of them will be in english
interpretation ends the first was a question asked by mr mclean on october 28 1999
the baker lake freezer was well maintained but has exceeded its life span and requires replacement
since the community of baker lake has an empowerment agreement with community government & transportation there has been uncertainty about departmental responsibility for funding the replacement
community freezers are currently the responsibility of the department of sustainable development however the former department of public works now public works and housing often provided staff to assist with freezer maintenance
the superintendent of community government & transportation department of sustainable development and public works & housing have agreed to draft a discussion paper on the community freezer program for their ministers review
when the review has been completed the responsible department will provide an update

hon jack anawak interpretation
the next one is a return to an oral question that was brought up by mr iqaqrialu regarding the rankin inlet utilidor project
the budget for the project was 8 9 million with the hamlet paying the larger share of the costs
the correction of the elevation calculation error on the nuuvuk subdivision utilidor did not cause the project to go over budget
there were no additional costs to the government of nunavut as a result of the error

length of runway overlay in qikiqtarjuaq
hon jack anawak interpretation
i have another return to an oral question regarding the length of a runway overlay for qikiqtarjuaq
the project was intended to extend the runway to 3 939 feet
during a geo-technical check problems with soil conditions causing unstable ground were found after the 3 800 foot mark
therefore the overlay was extended only to 3 800 feet from the existing 3 475 feet and the angle straightened to produce a standard taxiway shape
thirty eight hundred feet is more than sufficient for air carriers such as the hawker sidley which requires 3 500 feet for maximum loads

location of old dump site
hon jack anawak interpretation
a response to mr nutarak s question on october 29 1999
the department is funding the abandonment and restoration project on the old dumpsite at pond inlet which began in 1999 three hundred and eighty thousand was spent in 1999/2000
if budget estimates are approved another 180 thousand will be spent to complete the project in the upcoming year
this should deal with the concern about unpleasant smells in the area

question 148 - 1 3
fuel price increase effects on hunters
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i have a question directed towards the department of public works
mr speaker nti president paul quassa has released a report and he was interviewed and we were told that there were going to be fuel hikes
we will be paying almost a million dollars because of the increase in the gas prices
paul quassa also stated that the hunters have rights to go hunting trapping and fishing within nunavut
i would like to ask the minister if the ministers are as concerned as we are about the gas price hikes
this gas price hike became effective on january 1 and i would like to ask the ministers if they would work together with nunavut tunngavik in regards to the gas price hikes
thank you mr speaker

we just followed the world prices of fuel and the price of fuel has gone up in canada and we have no choice but to follow it
as the government we do pay a subsidy for fuel and it is a huge amount

mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is to the minister of public works & housing
however it was on january 6th 2000 that the minister sent a letter to mlas informing us of this price increase
my question to the minister is why weren t the regular mlas informed or told about this increase before it went into place
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister responsible for public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
about the fuel price hikes this was approved by the cabinet and there was no other way out
it was evident that we had to go through with this so i apologize to the regular members we did not inform you right away but we had informed the hamlet councils so i apologize to the regular members
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker in the bathurst mandate the government says that the government is guided by the principles of openness and the mandate also says that mlas will be respected as important sources of community opinion
mr speaker i would like to ask the minister if she feels again why we weren t told and why she felt that it was more important to inform the hamlets and not the elected members that represent those people

question 150 - 1 3
timing of fuel price increase
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is on the same issue and it s to the minister responsible for petroleum products
mr speaker the increase in the fuel by 6 cents came at a very unfortunate time of the year
it was around christmas time and we were informed or learned that the price was going up by 6 cents
it s like to me merry christmas happy new year here s your christmas gift
my concern is that the fuel that is presently in the tanks was purchased last year and has been there since last summer
why is the price being increased now on fuel that was purchased last year
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we could have increased the price the day the fuel was delivered but we deferred the increase until now
so the price was going to increase then but did not

hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes i apologize we had to increase the fuel price when everybody was celebrating christmas
i don t think we can expect prices to go down but it was not 6 cents it was 5 cents
the increasing of the price was set for that date
again i apologize if we did not notify the members properly
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you ms thompson
second supplementary mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i am not seeking an apology for the increase i realize there are reasons for this i am just trying to get my mind around the process and why it happened at the time it happened
given the fact that the minister has stated that she was aware that the price was going to increase
my earlier question was the fact that this fuel was purchased last year at x number of dollars what is the rationale for increasing the price of fuel that we purchased at a lower price
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we usually increase the prices during the fall and it s evident as i have stated before we don t expect the prices of fuel to go down
although we paid for that fuel at that price we have to follow the increases too so that is just a normal procedure
thank you
speaker
thank you ms thompson
final supplementary mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
unfortunately that still didn t answer my question
the minister is basically saying that the fuel that we purchased last year if we purchased it for example at 30 dollars a barrel there is an increase of another 10 dollars
so we are paying an increase on fuel that we purchased last year at a lower price
my question to the minister is what knowledge does she have if any of where we are going from this point on with increases to our fuel costs
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we had tried to look as to how we could decrease the price and at that time you were the chairman when the keewatin people were talking about the fuel prices
at that time it was evident and understandable how we could decrease the prices of fuel
my officials in petroleum products i have asked them to look into how we can best deal with the fuel coming into nunavut
at this time we are now working on this issue and that is the work that we are doing for the future

mr tootoo

mr speaker my question is for the minister of public works & housing regarding the fuel price increase
in the minister s letter that we received dated january 6 the minister stated that part of the cost of the increase was due to the higher costs of transportation

question 154 - 1 3
impact of fuel price increase
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
my next question is to the minister responsible for petroleum products
mr speaker we were hit with a 5 6 7 cent per litre rise in fuel prices last year based on the freight and the world price of crude
i know this year like everything else the cost of living is going up everywhere and we are about to purchase fuel again
i know that we didn t get the full impact on the last increase on the price of fuel
but we are going to be buying fuel at possibly a higher cost again this year plus the freight will probably go up again as well
does the minister anticipate what kind of increase we will be looking at this year so we can maybe look at lessening the impact
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister responsible for public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in regards to the increased prices if there is an increase in anything the government eats it up
we only raised the price by 5 cents while we could have put it up more
we had to put an increase on the gas prices
in nunavut the nunavut government gives at least a 50% subsidy
the mla for baker lake this is a hypothetical question so today i can t tell you how much it is going to increase next year
thank you mr speaker
speaker
oral question mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
i don t have to stress the importance of gasoline and the impact it has on the traditional economy in nunavut
we know that there are a lot of subsistence hunters and trappers out there and an increase in the cost of gasoline really impacts how people in nunavut put food on their table
is this government or this minister prepared to look at the cost effectiveness and looking at the bottom line when they re purchasing petroleum products and playing hardball and also at the carriers when they re bringing it in
are we paying premiums when we purchase petroleum products and will this government look at bringing in fuel at a competitive price
rather than not being so diligent on it
thank you ms minister
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr mclean two questions and you exceeded your allowable questions

gjoa haven drinking water
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct my question to the minister of health and social services
i think everybody knows about gjoa haven and the water quality
the water in gjoa haven is of poor quality and every body knows of that now

through cbc when we were in iqaluit and there was also an article done about it in the newspapers
they would like to have good water

what is going to happen to these people
is something going to start growing in them
mr minister can you respond to my question so that i can give a response back to the people back in gjoa haven
if you would respond please mr minister
speaker
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker let me first say that and speaking on behalf of this government we realize that having that larva having that organism in the water is not acceptable
what needs to be done is that some type of filter or some type of valve on the intake for the water in the water reservoir
my understanding is mr speaker that the sump pump that sucks the water out was maybe too close to the ground and thus the larva came in
they are not a health risk
but they don t look good for the appearance of the water and i agree with him
we are working with cgt and cgt is looking at technical ways for fixing this problem as soon as possible
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation

if we will do something about this problem right away could you give me a time line of when the people of gjoa haven will have clean water
speaker
thank you mr puqiqnak mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
it is my understanding that cgt is working on this problem currently
there has to be information gathered on how the water is transported from the reservoir to the trucks and then to the domestic establishments - homes and offices and so on
that work is continuing
what i can say to the member after the session today i will meet with the member and we will find out exactly where we are right now
we ll meet with mr anawak whose department is working on this issue to try and rectify it
and let me say again mr speaker these worms are distasteful to see but all indications from the department of health is they are safe and we are trying to help the people of gjoa haven

question 158 - 1 3
decision making process for subsidies mr mclean
the nine million dollars the government puts into home heating fuel etc
mr speaker my question is how does cabinet or the financial management board decide on how much a subsidy is going to be on petroleum products every year
is it just thrown out there that we are going to charge eighty cents a litre for gasoline and seventy cents a litre on fuel oil
is there a certain criteria to show how much is a gas subsidy or how much is a petroleum products subsidy
how is that determined
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean
who are you addressing your question to
mr mclean
who ever decides
what ever minister over their mr speaker decides what the subsidy will be on petroleum products whether it s public works or the financial management board who ever they are mr speaker
thank you
speaker
thank you
mr mclean
mr mclean if there are two ministers then the premier is supposed answer the questions
mr mclean
i guess i would have to ask the minister of finance because i guess he writes the cheque to subsidize the petroleum products program
so would the minister answer me how he figures out how much he is going to subsidize the petroleum products division every year
is it just a ball park figure or is it some kind of magic formula
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the petroleum products division as you know is a bit separate from government
they operate with a revolving fund that has certain guidelines as far as they re not able to enter into a too large deficit position as a result of the sale of petroleum products
i don t have the full details on how that works but i can provide that information to all members
i can tell you there was a request for considerably more than the five cents that was passed on recognizing the significance of the increase nunavut-wide

question 159 - 1 3
changes to decentralization
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
regarding community empowerment i would like to ask this question to the premier about decentralization
when the nunavut government was first established and we were elected we talked about decentralization and we talked about infrastructure we were going to decentralize to igloolik pangnirtung and arviat to all these communities
they had stated how many staff would be going to these communities for example igloolik was to receive 72 5 positions at that time the beginning of the government
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes i have written a letter to the municipalities and i m sure that you have also received a copy
as you are aware there are some positions filled already in igloolik in fact the infrastructure is not complete yet and some of the housing is not available for the staff
so if the staff move up there right away they won t have any housing and there would be housing problems
so we have to look in to all these details and the staff need infrastructure to work

thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is for the minister responsible for petroleum products

mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker earlier the minister responsible for public works and services indicated that back in the fall when they purchased their summer purchase of fuel they knew right away that they would have to increase the price
she also indicated that usually they increase the price in the fall
again i guess i would ask what led to the delay of the price increase until january
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister responsible for public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the fuel that we purchase for the communities is transported and put in the tanks
we don t see the actual price and the landed cost of this fuel until later
it takes a long time for us to find out the actual price of the fuel and we also do a study and find out whether we are going to be going into a deficit situation or not
we don t know the actual price or whether there is going to be a hike in the rates when the fuel is landed at the community level
i didn t know whether we were going into a deficit situation or not when the fuel was landed
we had to do an analysis of the costs and whether we are going to stay within budget or whether we are going to have a deficit before we set the price
like i said we just follow through with the global market and when the fuel is brought into the community and only afterwards do we start getting the paperwork the invoices and so on
after we do a review of all the paperwork then we make a decision whether there is going to be an increase in the fuel rate
thank you
speaker
third supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the minister indicated that they don t know ahead of time what the fuel and transportation costs are
mr speaker is the minister saying that they just say we ve got all these empty tanks just fill them up and tell us what it is going to cost us after
how do they determine who is going to do that i am sure there must be some type of contract in place so that you do know ahead of time what you are getting
i guess my question is what is the process
is there a service contract in place for the supply and delivery of those products
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister responsible for public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
well you have to fill the tanks because we can t operate the communities without petroleum products
we have to buy petroleum products
the cost of fuel is not the only thing that we factor in there is also the transportation costs and employees salaries and benefits the gas delivery people at the community level the administration
there are all kinds of factors put in there before we see the actual costs
like i said there is 9 million 661 thousand plus that we pay out mr speaker
we don t see the actual costs there is not only the purchase of the gas there are other cost factors which eat into the budget
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson

community costs for fuel
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
part of the question that i was going to ask was already answered by the minister of public works
there are different rates at the community level
for example it will cost x amount of dollars in arviat it will cost an x amount in arctic bay and so on
there are different rates in each of the individual communities
so what i would like to see the minister produce is exactly how much each community is paying for petroleum products
some of the communities rates were increased by 6 or 7 cents
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
minister responsible for public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation

petroleum product contracts
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
my written question is to the most popular minister today the minister responsible for petroleum products
mr speaker i would like a list of the contracts that exist that are held by local dealers that supply fuel to the various homes and businesses in each community
i would like to know the status as to when these contracts are up the value of these contracts so that we can determine the rates that was asked earlier by one of the mlas
what i am looking for is the actual contract when they are renewed and the rates for each contract

ikuma working group report
hon ed picco
good morning
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker later today i will table a copy of the ikuma report which is a comprehensive document developed by the ikuma working group
this document represents the first major step towards the creation of a functioning power corporation in nunavut
it is anticipated that the nunavut power corporation will be a made in nunavut solution for the provision of electrical power to the residents of nunavut
mr speaker as the members are aware the northwest territories power corporation with its headquarters over there in hay river currently provides power to nunavut through a transition agreement
a transition agreement mr speaker that expires march 31st 2001
between now and then it is critical that the nunavut power corporation develops the capacity to provide these services to nunavummiut
with that in mind our first step was to establish the ikuma working group last summer and assign them the task of studying different options mr speaker for the provision of power in nunavut
uqaqti the ikuma report shows clearly that we are in a good position to establish an independent nunavut power corporation and we have been very busy these past several months laying out the framework necessary to move forward
i am pleased to inform you that a director has been identified within our own public service to lead this government initiative
this individual will work very closely over the next fourteen months with the president of the nunavut power corporation
we are now publicly advertising throughout nunavut mr speaker for the position of president of the nunavut power corporation
it is also anticipated that this position will be filled by april 2000
also assisting in this implementation are some of the former ikuma working group members who helped to outline the options in the ikuma report a tremendous amount of work lies ahead over the next few months
following the approval by the legislative assembly of the main estimates i will be in a better position to provide you with further updates on this very important work
in consultation with the cabinet and you the mlas and the public we will have to make many decisions
we will have to develop the corporate structure of the power corporation we will have to determine how much capacity can reasonably be developed within nunavut before march 31st 2001
we will have to decide what levels of services will have to be imported how rates might be regulated and the level of decentralization that can be achieved over the short and the long term
mr speaker i look forward to discussing the ikuma report with the members of this assembly later this week

passing of inusiq sarah akavak
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise to pay tribute to inusiq sarah akavak who died violently and tragically in iqaluit recently
inusiq was a well known and well loved resident of iqaluit originally from kimmirut
she worked very hard supporting her family by selling jewellery in public places in iqaluit in the evenings often with her beloved daughter at her side
she also worked very hard during the day housekeeping in houses and as a hotel chambermaid
it seemed inusiq always had a smile and a kind word for everyone whether or not they made a purchase from her
it also seems that at the same time she was coping with violence in her personal life and that she carried this burden largely on her own
mr speaker the residents of iqaluit kimmirut and many other places where inusiq was known and loved were shocked and saddened by the sudden death of such a hard working and always cheerful person
they are especially saddened because it seemed that this tragedy occurred because of severe family distress
mr speaker my community of iqaluit is reeling from the pressures of growth and rapid change
it is my sincere hope that we strive to build nunavut and make our own new government work
we will also pay attention to helping our citizens cope with the social pressures and costs of change and growth
sadly tragedies such as the death of inusiq remind us of the need for a strengthened health and social service programs which can reach out and offer help to those that are suffering
funeral services were held for inusiq in kimmirut yesterday mr speaker
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
we will send a sympathy letter to the family that has lost a loved family member

speaker interpretation
minister of transportation mr anawak

we can t order the airlines what to do but perhaps the airlines themselves are looking at alternate routes

mr tootoo
question 165 - 1 3
fuel subsidies
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the minister responsible for public works and services and petroleum products
yesterday mr speaker the minister indicated that there were four areas in which the government department subsidizes the fuels across nunavut which were diesel fuel heating fuel aviation fuel gasoline and jet a1
mr speaker yesterday the minister indicated that the total subsidy by the government by her department was 9 6 million dollars
mr speaker the numbers that she provided in the house yesterday on the breakdown of those subsidies only come up to about 7 million dollars unless i got a number wrong
mr speaker i am wondering if there is another area of subsidy that was missed and where the other 2 million dollars in subsidies go
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
the minister responsible for public works manitok thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
i just mentioned heating aviation gasoline and jet a1 fuel but there are other subsidies they are heating fuel motor aviation fuel naphtha and av-gas
the total figure is still nine million six hundred fifty one thousand two hundred sixty six dollars
if the member wants me to tell him the rest of the subsidies i can do so or i can table this document
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you ms thompson

oral questions
mr puqiqnak
question 166 - 1 3
gjoa haven water quality
mr puqiqnak
thank you mr speaker
my question is for minister responsible for community governments and my question is regarding gjoa haven s water reservoir
we all are aware that i raised this issue yesterday about some worms in the water supply and mr speaker i have a question
the water reservoir at risk is in gjoa haven
we have problems with the water system
we had problems with the lines for the reservoir as well as the pump house and every morning one of our local staff members have to de-ice the line because the line tends to freeze every morning
so mr speaker it was previously fixed and we had a line about four miles going to our community and the water reservoir is very small now mr speaker
but right now the water reservoir in gjoa haven is causing problems and the minister of justice has been working on decentralization to our community
there is also the fact that our population is growing and decentralization is impacting on our community
mr speaker my question to the minister is whether he will address this issue regarding the problems with the water reservoir in gjoa haven mr speaker
will the minister address this issue for gjoa haven
mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr puqiqnak
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we are waiting for some consultants that will be looking at some parts that we have ordered for this water reservoir and they are in communication with the hamlet council about the situation in gjoa haven
so we are waiting for some parts but i m very sorry that we are taking much longer than we expected mr speaker
perhaps today or tomorrow we will give you an update on what is happening with this issue in gjoa haven
speaker interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker i remember the issue of the water system that s been in place and hasn t been used in a long time because the container is so small
is the minister saying they will be using that existing water filter system that s in place or are they ordering parts for another water system
speaker
thank you mr puqiqnak
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
sorry to clarify the issue mr speaker when i mentioned that we have ordered some parts perhaps tomorrow i will give you a more detailed update mr speaker
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
perhaps i don t think that item has been budgeted
but perhaps they will have to look for some funding elsewhere from their department
is there a way they will address this issue in gjoa haven mr speaker
speaker
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we are all aware that we have some concerns on health issues especially with the water supply
in conjunction with the minister of health and social services we will be working very hard to address this issue mr speaker and in terms of the water supply and the organisms in the water supply
so i will be sitting down with the minister of health and social services and look at this issue very closely
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr anawak interpretation i want to remind you the budget has not been tabled perhaps at the committee of the whole you can discuss possible funding that could be allocated for this issue
question 167 - 1 3
hall beach school
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker there have been a number of petitions from hall beach for the school system
perhaps the minister of education has written a letter but i don t recall seeing any of those letters
can we get an update on what is happening with the school in hall beach

speaker
thank you mr irqittuq
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this addition was previously from the gnwt and there have been a number of times it has been delayed in the capital plans and now it has been delayed to the 2000/2001 plans mr speaker
we re short mr speaker in terms of capital dollars for nunavut so we re only dealing with emergency or priority issues
perhaps at the committee of the whole we can look at this item a little more closely
where you would like to put it in a twenty year plan and look at a twenty year plan for capital in education
we would like to prepare plans that will look at long term plans instead of short term
if you only look at short term plans it doesn t really help
so i want to work very closely with the members to prepare a long term plan for education
thank you mr speaker

mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
it is my understanding that you will just be reviewing 2000/2001 plans for hall beach
mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we will be looking at all the schools in nunavut
we have included hall beach in the 2000/2001 plans and we will be doing some inspections on that basis
so hall beach has been included in our plans
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the minister mentioned that you are looking at the architectural plans in terms where the location will be for these schools
you gave some examples so can you give us some clarification mr speaker
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i was just giving you an example of the location because we have seen a lot of schools built
some are improperly structured and there are some other problems
pond inlet is one example and the other one is baker lake
i was just giving you an example of the foundations of these facilities because spring and winter effect the ground and the base for example in clyde river
the reason we want to see a long term plan is because it would be more beneficial for these communities
if we put in a twenty year plan i think it will be more beneficial for these communities using our funds for the greater good of the communities mr speaker
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you
mr speaker back in december we were in hall beach
the minister was asked at the public meeting when we would see a new school
the minister responded to that question and i would ask him to explain how you responded at that time
would you clarify that here
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes i could clarify what i said in hall beach mr speaker
i think what i stated in hall beach and how that reflects in terms of our budget for education i think that if i were to respond to that question fully i would take up all your time
i think it would be more appropriate if i could respond to that question later because if i respond to it now i would take up too much time mr speaker
you would have to look at architectural plans and other plans and the long term plans we have for the school facilities
you would have to look at long term plans for population forecasted from kindergarten up to grade twelve
thank you mr speaker

question 168 - 1 3
manitoba / keewatin power grid
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
my question today is for the minister responsible for the power corporation in nunavut
mr speaker some time ago a committee was struck to review and study the possibility of a power grid between manitoba and the keewatin
mr speaker we spoke about at great length the increase in fuel costs and the effect it s having on the people of nunavut
my question to the minister is can he give the members an update as to the status of this study and proposal that has been ongoing for the past year and a half
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for the power corporation
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker just a point of clarification is the member asking about the ikuma working group report or is he asking about the pre -feasibility study by manitoba hydro
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr picco
could you rephrase your question mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i m referring to the pre-feasibility study of which we spoke about in this house before and the fact that this report or study has been ongoing for the past two years
so i think it s fairly clear where my question is coming from
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister for the power corporation - mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the pre-feasibility study was delivered officially to the government in mid-september
i guess we are fortunate that on sunday and monday a delegation from manitoba including some representatives from manitoba hydro will be here in rankin inlet and will be giving a presentation
my understanding mr speaker is that presentation is on the pre-feasibility study of manitoba hydro
at that time i will be meeting with the minister responsible for the power corporation for manitoba hydro to discuss issues surrounding the pre-feasibility study
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr o brien
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i think it s very important to point out this is a pre-feasibility
it s broad in its implication and its assumptions
there are major impacts on environmental assessments on parks on protected areas and indeed mr speaker there are huge capital dollar implications
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
it is my understanding that presently we re paying seventy cents per kilowatt hour for power in the keewatin
can the minister confirm a comment or statement that was made in the pre-feasibility study that indicated that if this line this linkage were to go ahead that costs would actually be reduced to twenty-five cents per kilowatt hour
would he consider that significant
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for the power corporation
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
what i am saying mr speaker is that this government will be meeting with the manitoba officials
there will be an in-depth presentation by manitoba hydro on this pre-feasibility study
we will have to look at it over the next couple of weeks to see where we go from there
there are major cost implications infrastructure implications into the millions and hundreds of millions of dollars
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
final supplementary mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker prior to christmas a number of the members ministers and the premier in winnipeg attended a presentation regarding a road linkage and power grid
there was a fair bit of detail given and the information provided to the members
can the minister tell me what has changed if anything from that presentation to what he s expecting in this new presentation that is coming up this week
if there have been any significant changes from what we heard at that point and what he expects to hear this week
mr speaker i sense there doesn t seem to be as much support for this project as there should be and that s just the sense i m getting and this is why i bring this issue forward
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for the power corporation
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it s very difficult for me to commit this government to spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a pre-feasibility study of a report that is not even of this government
it is being done by another government
there has to be a comprehensive analysis
there needs to be a cost/benefit analysis on the dollars involved
my understanding mr speaker is that the pre-feasibility study will lead to of course a feasibility study which may take three to five
>>audio unavailable
hon ed picco continues rivers between here and churchill manitoba
so the report is broad in its implications
as the minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation i have not had an opportunity to sit down with my colleagues in manitoba hydro to discuss the issue
i will have that opportunity over the next couple of days
i will commit to coming back to this house after consultation with the department of the executive with intergovernmental affairs who we will be working with in partnership to see where we go as our next step
but i cannot commit to this house the spending of hundreds of millions of dollars until a comprehensive analysis mr speaker a cost/benefit analysis is done on the report
again this is a pre-feasibility study
thank you mr speaker

question 169 - 1 3
permanent solution to gjoa haven water problem
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker mr speaker my question s for the minister responsible for community government & transportation
the member from gjoa haven has been talking about an issue with their water reservoir problems that they re having with the blood worms
mr speaker in an editorial in the paper on monday the mayor indicated that it has been a priority for the community for the last 20 years
are you looking at a solutions to fix this problem once and for all
thank you mr speaker
speaker
before i recognise the minister responsible for transportation mr tootoo you were referring to an article in the newspaper can you rephrase your question
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you
i d like to remind the members that articles in the papers are not supposed to be questioned in this house unless they are tabled
so when you are questioning please don t use articles from the newspapers
minister responsible for community government & transportation mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
mr speaker on issues of priority in terms of these kind of problems if it is indeed an emergency we deal with it as an emergency mr speaker
i think we all like to provide quality service for all our communities in nunavut in terms of their water reservoirs
so it s being looked at as an emergency issue mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr anawak
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
i understand there s things going on to that effect and i was asking if there is a permanent long term solution that will be looked at by his department right now
thank you mr speaker

yes mr speaker yes i made some commitments that were looking at some solutions for the gjoa haven situation and we want to look at long term plans of how that will be beneficial for the community

oral questions mr mclean
question 170 - 1 3
diavik mine overlap agreement
mr mclean
but mr speaker it s an issue of great importance because it impacts the water sheds of nunavut especially the coppermine river and long term impacts of a mine in that area could really cause harm
could the minister responsible update me on where nunavut stands in this agreement to date
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk
we have been very active on this file just the last little while
to give the member and the house an indication of where we are with the file the inuit organizations and our department have been very vocal and active in asking to be included in the final agreement
however the department of indian affairs and northern development has the final say as to if we can be included in this agreement
so we have looked at the other options to ensure that the concerns of the nunavut communities and the inuit organizations can be closely monitored for the environmental impact which may be caused
so right now we are looking at a new development of a trans-boundary agreement which will address the concerns of the people of nunavut and also the organizations and the governments
thank you mr speaker

i would like to remind the members that we ll be giving those members who haven t asked questions a first chance
question 171 - 1 3
five year plans
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker my question is directed to the premier
it s in regards to the government of the northwest territories and the five year plan that used to be created
i m assuming that the nunavut government will be looking at setting five year plans
when the nunavut government was created did you keep using the five year plan that was put together by the government of the northwest territories or not
speaker
minister of finance
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
we made a commitment to the house and to municipalities who had raised the issues as well that we would be developing a five year capital plan
as the work continues on that with the departments we expect within a couple of months to have that
thank you
speaker interpretation thank you mr ng
oral questions
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
so do i understand then that the five year plans that were created by the government of the northwest territories will no longer be used by this government
speaker
minister of finance
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i wouldn t say that it wouldn t be used a lot of planning work has taken place in the government of the northwest territories capital planning initiatives
as you know that information has been retained by the government of nunavut
so the new government of nunavut five year capital plan would be a reflection of some of those priorities
speaker interpretation
thank you mr ng
oral questions
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
then i would like to ask the minister in regards to the hamlet councils are you going to be asking them what they would like to see and put into the five year capital plan
because of course the hamlet councils identified their priorities with the previous government
are you going to be asking the hamlet councils then what they would like to see in the five year capital plan
thank you
speaker
thank you
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would suggest to all members that during the budget consultation processes all municipalities whether it is directly through their mayors deputy mayors hamlet councillors and the community as a whole identified what their municipal priorities were
so that will be taken into consideration

question 172 - 1 3
inuit qaujimajatuqangit plans
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the minister of culture language elders & youth
when we were touring the communities one thing that kept coming up at just about every community was inuit qaujimajatuqangit
we were told by the people out there that inuit qaujimajatuqangit is fading
for example igloo building hunting techniques sewing and so on
i would like to ask you how far along is the planning for the preservation of inuit qaujimajatuqangit
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister of culture language elders & youth
hon donald havioyak interpretation
i thank the member for his important question
mr speaker our planning for our future training of the northern people in regards to inuit qaujimajatuqangit is progressing as we speak
the people that are going to be involved in this inuit qaujimajatuqangit process are our own employees nti nsdc and others
our plan for the future is that right now we are working on this program and i will be tabling details on this soon in the house
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
you stated that you will be working with nti but i see this as an emergency as a priority as there are fewer and fewer elders who have this knowledge
i would like to see something implemented before our elders are gone
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
i heard three questions
minister responsible for culture language elders & youth mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i know our elders are getting fewer
we are trying to make it move faster and work together faster but also right now we are trying to do it right
i hear what you are saying but we need to find out for the future what kind of future we will be having and work together with nti and nsdc
when we get all the information together i will let you know
the language and stories before they are all gone we want all that information from the elders
i recognize that but right now we don t really know the future
i want to answer your question and i would like to be meeting them right now but i don t really know the answer but if i find out i will let you know

question 173 - 1 3
clyde river power rates
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct this question to the minister of the power corporation
in my community of clyde river they built a power plant but with it came greatly increased power costs
this is kind of scary today when there s very high unemployment at the community level
so i would like to ask you mr minister on the proposed bills how that would effect the rates
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
thank you very much for the question
i tried to explain in the house over the past several months when this question has come up what is happening with the community based rates
we are trying to work within the time frame and the parameters of that to negate that type of increase
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
it s going to have a very big effect at the community level
it doesn t matter whether it is 35% or 40% it s going to have a huge effect at the community level there is high unemployment at the community level and any hike is going to effect the people out there
even if it is only 35% it doesn t matter
the nunavut government are trying to set up a system that would suit nunavut
we are the ones that want to make things a little bit easier for the people of nunavut
if it effects nunavut then everyone is going to be effected
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker that is an excellent question and it goes back to the harmonisation of the rate balances that we have in nunavut and we realize there is some concern there
in the ikuma report which will be tabled later this afternoon and indeed next week we will have an opportunity to debate some of those issues it talks about the rate harmonisation that the member has brought up
we realize as a government and it is pointed out in the ikuma report that the rate balancing at the present time may be unfair in certain instances
the cost per kilowatt hour for power in nunavut goes from about 41 cents to a high of a little over 61 cents in nunavut
the subsidy program is still in place
they would be paid for that and indeed at that time the government of nunavut would also be an intervenor
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
again this question is for the minister of the power corporation
have you looked for any funding that could be used to subsidize the power rates
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker since the advent of power in nunavut and indeed since the nwt power corporation was set up we do have in place the territorial power subsidy program
everyone of us here that pays our power bill receives a subsidy
so that subsidy is in place
one of the concerns that we have mr speaker looking at the power corporation and indeed the split east and west is to see if that power subsidy that is in place right now was viable and sustainable
that s one of the things that comes out in the ikuma report
so that power subsidy is in place we are subsidized

thank you mr tootoo
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it is my understanding and as i said we did hit every community in nunavut the 25 incorporated communities
i can t say that every single mayor or every single municipality put forward a presentation
i know in the case of iqaluit that the town council met separately with their mlas and i don t have the outcomes of those discussions
but certainly there was input throughout nunavut and from all municipalities
thank you
speaker
thank you mr ng
oral questions
mr tootoo
mr tootoo

mr speaker i just want to ask if it has been past practice for municipalities to submit five year capital plans to the department for their consideration in the development of the capital budget
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
well mr speaker the five year capital plan is a government of nunavut document and in the past it has been a government of the nwt document
it has never been developed by municipalities
but what has happened is that municipalities have been asked for input into their priorities based on the government s planning document for capital and that s what we would continue to look at
and of course the elected mlas as well provide input into that same document and try to formalize some of the needs and then make recommendations to put forward to address those needs
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr ng

minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
mr speaker i think i indicated earlier that there is no formal government of nunavut five year planning document as it stands right now
we are working now to complete that within the next couple of months
once we get through the budget process for the 2000/2001 year after that is completed then the mlas communities will have an opportunity to make input into the draft five year capital planning document that will be prepared

the primary contacts for all the municipalities are the community government & transportation officials that are set up and established throughout the regions to provide that liaison with the municipal councils
the second opportunity of course is through their mlas and finally through the budget consultation process that took place this past fall as far as for the current year budget

mr o brien

thank you mr chairman
i wonder if the minister can give us some background and rationale for this additional expenditure that is required for finance and administration
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
it is for information technology and the primary reason for the funding shortfalls and the request of the dollars is for system development and maintenance costs greater than expected during the course of this year
certain major projects that weren t completed prior to april 1 1999 became an expense for this current year
primarily in those areas of human resources and payroll systems and income support systems
development work has started on more systems than originally anticipated and there were unanticipated items that allocated to it budgets as well
this was because the exceeded expectations caused additional services and equipment to be required to support that mr chairman
thank you

minister do you expect any requirement for additional funding prior to the end of this fiscal year for this particular project
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr minister if you would respond please

thank you mr chairman
mr chairman we do expect that there will be some additional requirements but those requirements will be funded internally through unexpended funds and savings
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien anything else
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman this for the most part is a very lean money bill
having said that does the minister expect coming before the house to further request additional dollars before this fiscal year is up
whether it be for this project or any other
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr minister if would you respond please
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i would think that the likelihood would probably be positive in that respect given that once we are out of session here a lot is going to depend on what other departments require
if they require any internal re-allocation for whatever reasons but our responsibility would be to report back on that if those decisions were made at the financial management board level

mr minister

for example gjoa haven with the water situation that we talked about earlier today and if there was some immediate need there and cg&t had some specific request
then we would look at that request and again if it were approved then it would come back to the house
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr o brien any further comments
your last one you said
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
i would find it somewhat strange if another money bill would come forward before the end of the fiscal year unless it were an absolute emergency
so my question to you is that with the exception of an emergency wouldn t it be highly unlikely that you would need to come before the house again for another supplementary appropriation

mr chairman originally through the office of the interim commissioner there was a joint project with the gnwt to develop peoplesoft which was the human resource payroll system
that s where we are now
they are the ones providing the service for us
thank you

thank you mr minister of finance

is it the same system being used or is it a different system being used

thank you mr chairman
mr chairman it is two completely different systems

in light of the minister s comments i take it that whatever work was being done prior to april 1 on the peoplesoft project was basically scrapped
i m wondering if the minister could indicate the amount of money it cost this government to scrap that project
thank you mr chairman

thank you mr tootoo

thank you mr chairman
mr chairman prior to march 31 1999 2 3 million dollars was spent on the peoplesoft human resource payroll side of things
since april 1 1999 we have put we ve put 1 2 million dollars into the payroll
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo

is the minister saying that there was 2 3 million dollars paid for this program that we didn t use
and 1 2 million paid for the program that we are using right now
thank you mr chairman

thank you mr tootoo
minister of finance your response

thank you mr chairman
mr chairman no it was 2 3 million dollars prior to march 31 and 1 2 since april 1 for the peoplesoft program
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister of finance any further comments mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
so it was a total of 3 5 million dollars basically chucked out the window
surprising maybe just in light of that what have we spent on this new program that we are using right now

okay go ahead mr tootoo if you would like to respond
mr victor tootoo
thank you mr chairman
the peoplesoft project was developed at the time the oic was in place prior to april 1 1999
it was a joint project with the gnwt and certain commitments were signed on to at the time through the oic
decisions were made to develop a joint program that both governments could use
considerable work was done prior to april 1st and also the 1 2 million dollars for this current fiscal year a large percentage of that was committed to prior to april 1st and prior to this government becoming a reality
during that review we decided that the project just wasn t happening fast enough basically and that there were very many deadlines that weren t being met
a lot of the work was being done in yellowknife and we didn t have a lot of input into the process
we decided that the project may not happen and that it wasn t an option for our government to not have a payroll system so we looked at other options
the one that we finally decided on the adp system i don t have the exact figures with me right now but i believe it s around 200 thousand for the complete system
as we mentioned earlier in the standing committee review there are a number of systems that we reviewed that were initially contracted in the days of the oic that were perhaps a bit too much for our government
we were looking for a bit more simple cost effective way of doing business and this was one of the decisions that we made in that regard

what is this money going to be used for
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr minister of finance a response
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairperson mr chairperson this is for providing for the implementation of a labour market supplement program for nurses
the program is geared toward monetary incentives through an annual retention and a one time recruitment bonus
the department of health is proposing to operate this program for two years with this year being the start of it
it is similar to what the northwest territories has recently announced in their program
it s our department of health s position that we must be able to match the competition for health care professionals providing a similar labour market supplement that they re asking to establish with this

thank you mr chairman
it is my understanding that it is specific to nurses only
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i know that there are a number of certified nursing assistants that play a crucial role in some of the health facilities across nunavut
in iqaluit for example there are some people some nurses cnas there that have had over 20 years experience
is there going to be something to be able to recognise the valuable role that these people play as well
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
particularly the health and social services area we know that there s high stress and high demands on their positions
i m sponsoring the total supplementary appropriation bill on behalf of the government maybe the minister of health might have some additional input or issues surrounding this that he might want to address in response to this question
strict interpretation of that agreement of the mou indicates to us that nurses fall within that category and therefore the market rate supplement for nurses it does not however cover off the certified nursing assistants
i appreciate the member bringing forward this issue i ve had several discussions with the certified nursing assistants
so we re aware of it and there is a recognition of those services thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr chairman the amount of 362 thousand that we are now looking at is part of the supplementary appropriation
i am curious as to why this amount is not going to be covered off in the 20 million that you referred to in reference to the deficit the three health boards are going to come forward with
is there any reason why it wasn t covered off in that as opposed to doing it through the appropriation here
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr minister for finance

thank you sir
mr o brien do you have other questions
mr o brien
i am not quite sure if that answered my question but to follow up on it are you saying that the health boards are not directly related to this additional cost or this package that is being offered
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr o brien i would like to remind you that when you are asking these questions if you would direct your questions to the chairperson
mr minister of finance do you want to respond to the question

yes maybe i will defer to the minister of health since it is his program

minister of health and social services do you want to respond to the question
mr picco
thank you mr chairman
mr o brien brings about a very interesting question and i will try to keep this response shorter for you mr chairman
the original budget appropriated by this assembly on april 1 in the last budget did not include the labour market supplement therefore it was not in the budget of the department of health and social services
therefore mr chairman it is being brought forward in a supplementary appropriation as an unbudgeted item in our budget

intergovernmental partnerships
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker our government is developing partnerships with jurisdictions across canada during the past six months the government of nunavut has participated in a series of federal provincial and territorial conferences
in early august we played host to the first annual northern leaders forum establishing a plan to develop a vehicle for addressing issues of common concern among the governments of nunavut nwt and yukon
i joined the provincial and territorial premiers in quebec city at the annual premiers conference
ministers have participated in a wide range of national meetings with their counterparts from the territories and provinces as well as the government of canada
a series of meetings are ongoing considering the social union agreement and how it can be used as a guide to enable the governments to better address the needs of their residents
in december i participated in a meeting of aboriginal and national political leaders to discuss aboriginal input into the social policies of canada
mr speaker as a premier i have had the opportunity to visit a number of provinces in the fall
i was a guest of premier tobin of newfoundland where we had the opportunity to discuss issues of common concern
in november in conjunction with the major mining conference attended by many of the mayors from kivalliq in winnipeg i had the opportunity to meet manitoba premier gary doer
in all of these meetings nunavut has been welcomed as the newest partner
our representatives are being given equal opportunities with their colleagues to raise issues of political importance to our people and reflective of our unique situation
our distinct challenges and unique experiences are something that our colleagues and other governments are eager to learn about
last year in june our government recognized the need to increase co-operation with our neighbours
interpretation ends we have since signed agreements with greenland yukon and the northwest territories to discuss mattes of common concern and understanding and together we will sign a mou between our governments
this mou will prepare the way for wide-ranging co-operation between nunavut and our neighbour to the south as together we will confirm our close ties
next month in conjunction with the arctic winter games i will travel to whitehorse to attend the second annual northern leaders forum
as territorial leaders we will continue to work together to achieve a series of pan-territorial goals including the devolution of powers from the federal government
it respects and blends the best of inuit and non-inuit culture and makes our community stronger
during the coming months there will be a number of intergovernmental meetings including the western premiers conference in brandon in may and our annual premiers conference in winnipeg this august
interpretation ends let me emphasize that participation in such a wide range of meetings is of great importance to our government
while nunavut has distinct challenges there are a number of concerns that we share with other provinces and territories and together we are forging stronger working relationships to manage these issues
the experience gained from these meetings and the strong relationships built between governments are valuable in developing a strong presence for nunavut on the national scene
interpretation mr speaker i wish to assure all members that following the bathurst mandate our government is beginning to take its place and develop its role as a committed and active participant in the life of canada

support for smaller communities
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today to express the concern of my community and my constituency
mr speaker all the communities of nunavut are growing in population and size annually
mr speaker in view of the future in nunavut it seems bleak since everything is getting to be expensive and the cost of living is being increased all the time now
recent examples of increases which have been very hard on my constituency are
the postage rate increase for parcels
fuel prices have increased on new year s eve airline tickets have been increased by first air
in clyde river we face challenges with possible power rates increases to pay for the new power plant mr speaker
all the nunavut communities have to have adequate operational funds
when i visit the capital of nunavut in iqaluit regional centres such as cambridge bay and rankin inlet i see government infrastructure growing and the government staff are increasing in the larger communities in nunavut
larger communities in nunavut are also growing with government offices government housing and government staff
i know that all this growth takes a lot of money from the budget of the government of nunavut
my constituents live in two small communities clyde river and broughton island

nunavut/manitoba road and power links
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker i rise today to speak about a subject that is a very important priority in my constituency and this region
that is the building of roads and power links between nunavut and manitoba
mr speaker this exciting project is about building partnerships with other governments to build our future in nunavut
it is about creating jobs for our people in road construction and maintenance in tourism and resource development
it is about reducing our heavy reliance on expensive oil and reducing pollution produced by fossil fuel
it is about linking nunavut with canada
mr speaker this project is also about common sense investing in lowering our very high cost of living and building our economy
for years now northern governments have been committed to looking at the feasibility and benefits of north/south highway and transmission links
mr speaker in june 1996 the government of nwt and manitoba agreed to work together on transportation and energy links
the report was produced in november 1999 on road corridors
the study also looked at both winter road and all weather road options
mr speaker five possible routes were identified between nunavut and manitoba
the road would begin in churchill gilmorden lake
the options include links to arviat whale cove chesterfield rankin and baker lake
the first step mr speaker would be to build a winter road which would also be the base for the construction of an all weather road
another major study was undertaken on behalf of the nwt power corporation and manitoba hydro
two possible routes for transmission lines have been mapped out between churchill and rankin inlet
arviat being the closest community would also be served from this line
as all the members know manitoba has an excess of hydro power which costs about one tenth the cost of our diesel and generated power
the manitoba power grid also already goes all the way to churchill which is only about two hundred miles from my home community of arviat
every year mr speaker our southern neighbours in manitoba export about 300 million dollars worth of goods and services to this region
i know that the province of manitoba puts a high value on this trade
i also believe that the province of manitoba would like to do its part to strengthen these links of trade and friendship
the province of manitoba shared the cost of these major studies with the government of canada
today we have further proof of their commitment to working with us with their presence here in nunavut the honourable gary doer the premier of manitoba and his distinguished delegation
i believe mr speaker that working together we can persuade the government of canada to support the building of links between nunavut and canada
nunavut is the only jurisdiction in canada which does not have a link to the rest of the country
mr speaker this project requires boldness and vision
i want to commend our premier for his early and strong commitment in exploring and developing stronger links between our territory and our neighbouring province
i also look forward to working with the honourable ed picco minister responsible for the power corporation to examine options for how we can restructure the new nunavut power corporation
we must also pay attention to the potential to develop alternative sources of energy
mr speaker the world price of oil went over thirty dollars a barrel just recently and we are in a very vulnerable situation
mr speaker also we would like to thank the honourable jack anawak minister of transportation for his support and attendance at the meeting in winnipeg last fall where these reports were unveiled
mr speaker i look forward to working with the minister to develop a long range plan for the winter road and permanent road from nunavut to manitoba
mr speaker i know that these are major challenges that size and the impact of this project is daunting
however mr speaker if we move in small steps we can accomplish this
mr speaker in closing this great country was not built by leaders who focussed on why you could not do something
it was built by leaders who said we can do it - lets find a way
mr speaker i look forward to making continuous progress on this exciting project

rankin inlet family violence project
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker i rise today to speak of a project started here in rankin inlet
this project involves trying to deal with family violence
we have some individuals who are here that are working on this project
valerie stubbs from our department of justice we have bonnie tulloch we also have judge browne from the nunavut government justice department
they have had quite a number of meetings with people in rankin inlet
they first tried this out as a pilot project to find out what they could do in counselling people going to court for family violence
there will be counselling provided to the abusers and the counsellor will know about traditional values and know how to talk to the abuser and the victims and the witnesses
mr speaker i think it will be a tremendous help to get the communities going in helping themselves when it comes to family violence
there are going to be some people at the community level and also the employees and the counsellors who have to be willing to work hard
mr speaker if we can do that then maybe we can lessen family violence at the community level
when there is a decrease we will see fewer people in the penitentiaries and the correctional centres and so on

hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker my statement is regarding the students who went down to iqaluit for a soccer tournament for tryouts for the whitehorse arctic winter games
principal donald clark received a letter from mindy willet of the kugluktuk team
the letter states
dear hon manitok thompson february 8 2000
i felt compelled to write to you and tell you how impressed i was with the youth from your community and your school
we played against your boys team and although they had superior skills they felt no need to blow us away
they played hard but fair and were excellent sportsmen even when they didn t win
i enjoyed all their company on and off the court
they were respectful polite and had a great sense of humour
obviously you are setting a good example over there in rankin inlet as a whole community
your coach was very caring and generous to the boys
what a role model
they all respect your community well
cheers mindy willet
here are the soccer boys and their coach
their coach was eddy sandy he has been volunteering for the last fourteen years for this community

inuit qaujimajatuqangit
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker i rise today about our traditional knowledge - inuit qaujimajatuqangit
on friday i asked a number of questions to the minister of culture language elders and youth
mr speaker i would just like to make a further reiteration that before all our elders pass away we must get from them knowledge on how to maintain traditional values and principles
we know that only a small number have complete knowledge of hunting skills for example
we have been given responsibilities
we have left our families to do our jobs so we cannot pass on our own knowledge to our children
this is how our ancestors lived and how we coped with the harshness of the weather
there are a lot of people who know how to go out and read the weather patterns and find out what the weather patterns will be
there are a lot of people who are striving and i think we should work hard in order to produce and come up with traditional curriculum standards
i think we have to work immediately
i realize nunavut tunngavik and other inuit organizations are working and pushing this issue
so we must push ahead because a lot of elders are passing away quickly and we are losing a lot of their knowledge
i feel this is a very important issue
this should be our first priority

thank you mr speaker i will once again discuss the water reservoir
we believe this water is not safe for consumption
though we realize the department is working on this issue my constituents are concerned about this water situation
i hope that this problem will resolved as soon as possible
last week the minister of health and social services stated that he would work in addressing this concern and that the water was safe
the community government has been consulted and i asked in the legislative assembly about this problem and mr anawak stated he would deal with this as soon as possible
he said it would be a first priority concern
mr speaker i told him my concerns and he said they would make a plan to address this problem
i was very pleased to hear when the minister stated that he would work very closely with us in this very important matter

michael savard
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today to recognize a young constituent michael savard a twelve year old student at aqsarniit school in iqaluit who was honoured recently by winning a national contest
michael was the only winner from nunavut in a contest sponsored by the national capital commission called every kids capital contest
the contest required the submission of a drawing story or poem
michael s won on his colourful drawing which expressed his dream of becoming the best scientist
this is an impressive achievement because there were a total of 15 thousand entries from all across canada and only thirteen winners
michael is the son of the proud parents andre savard and robitaille long time residents of iqaluit
michael and his whole family just came back from an action packed all expense paid trip to ottawa where they participated in winterlude ottawa s annual carnival
when they arrived they were welcomed by our member of parliament the honourable nancy karatek-lindell at the children s museum
at winterlude michael and his family were honoured for his achievement and they were able to view an enlarged copy of his picture displayed on the rideau canal
while visiting winterlude they were very pleased to see that nunavut was also represented at the ice sculpture competition where david paniuk and sam pitsiulak were the first participants from nunavut
michael was presented with a framed copy of his picture and a canadian flag
the highlight of the trip was going to the house of commons with the other contest winners where they were addressed by and met with the speaker of the house of commons
i m very pleased to congratulate michael and his family for honouring and representing our new territory of nunavut at this national event
i know members of this assembly will want to join me in congratulating on michael s achievement and for being an enthusiastic ambassador for nunavut in the nation s capital

pressing need for inuit qaujimajatuqangit
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i rise today to talk about an issue that i ve been concerned about in regards to the elders and the youth of nunavut
the elders today are decreasing in number and before they are gone we have to pass on inuit qaujimajatuqangit
we always keep saying that inuit qaujimajatuqangit should be instilled but it is not being practised today
we must use inuit qaujimajatuqangit because the elders have knowledge about social issues about survival about maintenance and about the environment
before the elders are gone we have to teach the youth about inuit qaujimajatuqangit which is all encompassing in survival on the land and water
this is becoming a emergency and i rose today to talk about this issue

question 175 - 1 3
support for smaller communities
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is directed to the premier
last week i asked our premier about the smaller communities
they should benefit from decentralization
our premier stated that he would like to see the smaller communities benefit from decentralization and that the nunavut government will not forget the smaller communities
when i heard that i was very happy to hear that from our premier and that they were strategizing to give benefits to the smaller communities through government operations through government services and transportation
i was wondering if he is willing to state what the strategy is for the smaller communities
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu

hon paul okalik interpretation

as i stated we are looking for ways of helping the smaller communities

we have to work with the community when we make plans

question 177 - 1 3
payment for grave workers
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
last spring during our session i think it was towards the end of session i asked some questions to the minister of community government
to date i have not received a reply
during the 1960s they moved grave sites to another location during the spring time when the ground was pretty wet
the people who were working on the relocation of these burial sites have never been paid
i have asked the minister when they will be receiving their pay cheques and i have given them the names of these people
i was wondering what your position is on that now

it is in regards to the community of taloyoak

you asked three questions in inuktitut
i heard three questions
minister of culture language elders & youth mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
it s a good question and i am going to try and reply to your concern
in pond inlet and also cambridge bay and baker lake we organized youth conferences as you may know
right now we are trying to look at their concerns and trying to make policies for youth and also for elders
they are working on it right now and drafting policies i can t really do anything until we follow up the kitikmeot and keewatin meetings of elders and youth
we want to hear their concerns in a few days they should be finished
we ll take a look at it and i will let you know
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation

i am glad that this is being taken into consideration but this department is recruiting and relocating it is going to be costly and will they be able to receive funding in order to cover these expenses

minister of culture language elders & youth mr havioyak
hon donald havioyak interpretation

i can provide more information on the decentralization plans what it is going to cost to decentralise some of our staff to the other communities but right now i do not have the answer
i will find out about the costs of decentralization first and then i will give you an answer
thank you mr speaker

thank you mr speaker
we are undertaking a policy review right now and we are trying to go by our policies
right now we are going by the old policies from the gnwt and we are upgrading our new policies
we have to be very careful with these policies that we are developing right now
all these will be done from the funding we will be receiving from the government
i already stated earlier that the elders and youth are already at their conference
we have to make our priorities first and we still have to listen to the young people and the elders because they are working together
i agree with you we have to develop these procedures and the policies very carefully that way they will be more understandable

health board deficit offset
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is directed to the minister of finance
i am wondering the minister in the article talks about close to a 20 million dollar deficit this only comes just under 14 million dollars
i d like to ask the minister of finance where the remaining funds are going to come to offset that

thank you mr speaker

thank you mr tootoo
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
if my memory is correct one of the standing committees also directed all unexpended funds going to health board deficits as well from my recollection
but anyway having said that i can t speak right now on what areas the surplus may go into until we table the upcoming budget and once the year end is resolved and all the final numbers are in
again it will be based on the preliminary estimates and the budget will roll out based on the final numbers
thank you
speaker
thank you mr ng
final supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the minister did indicate that it was also recommended by one of the standing committees that any health board deficit be covered off by the surplus and it appears that it has been mr speaker
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation thank you mr tootoo
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
quite frankly we have to deal with the health board deficit situation as those are ongoing programs that the health boards are delivering
as we all know they are finding some difficulties in delivering their programs for whatever reasons
they are going over budget and we have an obligation to continue to provide services because of the importance of our health care programs
so we have to find the funds to deal with that issue and i think all members recognize that
for an issue such as housing another equally important initiative and priority i think of all members it is not an ongoing current year issue
i mean it more relates to future needs and it would be more adequately addressed in that form in looking at future years budgets versus current year

question 180 - 1 3
liability for deficits

in the february 11 nunatsiaq news document it stated that there was 8 9 million dollars carried over from 98-99
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
wherever those jurisdictions lay with those wherever those agencies were based the surplus or deficit would remain with that jurisdiction effective april 1
if it was a nunavut based health board or education board or agency it would remain with them
so that was the agreement that we all signed off on and that took place effective april 1
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr ng
oral questions mr mclean

oral questions mr o brien
question 181 - 1 3
approval of funds for deficit
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
my question to the minister did the minister put forward to the fmb that the 20 million dollars would be covered under the funding that we dealt with last friday
was it approved was it forwarded by the minister of health to the fmb to have this included in the supplementary
speaker
thank you mr o brien
when you are asking questions to the minister please identify which minister you are referring to
mr o brien which minister are you referring to
mr o brien
mr speaker i indicated that the question was to the minister responsible for health speaker
okay thank you mr o brien minister responsible for health mr picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker there is no great mystery here as to what has happened with the health and social services boards
as of march 31 we had the audits completed for each board as the fiscal year was ending
that came forward in june and that s when we knew officially there was an 8 9 million dollar deficit with those three health boards
eight point nine million dollars plus is our best guesstimate mr speaker
right now it s an additional 11 million dollars
we won t know if it s 11 million dollars mr speaker until after march 31 2000 when the three audits will be completed for the three health boards
at that time we will know the total amount that will come forward
discussions at the fmb mr speaker as you know are privileged and i am not here to make representation on those discussions
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
i don t recall seeing 20 million dollars being put forward last week under the supplementary funding act
so if it s been approved i would hope it would come to the members first prior to going to the newspaper
we may have the money this year
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker first of all i can t make much comment on what the nunatsiaq news reports on any given day
what i can say to the member is i can t also guarantee if there s going to be a deficit within the department of health and social services one year from now
i am not nostradamus i can t tell the future
what i can say mr speaker is that if money needs to be spent within the department of health and social services for medivacs for needs program delivery we have to spend that money
and that is the reason why mr speaker in thirteen jurisdictions in canada ten provinces and three territories habitually the departments of health and social services run deficits because you have to spend the money on budgeted items
and that is the only guarantee i can give to the house
but i can say mr speaker that the money was not spent frivolously it was spent on needs services programs and staff
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
i agree with the honourable member i know he s not a brain surgeon
my question to the minister does he have a plan to ensure that next year we can deal with this situation
does the minister have a plan
and i guess furthermore as a secondary question mr speaker what has caused this 20 million dollar over-expenditure
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
two questions
minister responsible for health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
no mr speaker nostradamus was not a brain surgeon
for example mr speaker 25% of the board s allocated budget goes into travel medical travel and that accounts for almost 20% of the budget deficit that came forward as of march 31 1999
we do have a plan in place mr speaker the department has contracted consulting and audit canada to review the status of medical and social services travel with the objective of proposing a new policy for that travel
there are some economies of scale mr speaker on medical travel that we are working with within the three regions that we will be able to bring forward after april 1 with the integration of the health boards

nunavut business incentive policy
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker i am pleased today to inform the house of our progress on the development of a nunavut business incentive policy
this policy has been worked on for some time involving the departments of executive and intergovernmental affairs public works and housing nunavut tunngavik inc and representatives from the nunavut business community
i would like to take this time to thank them for their comments and advice to the working group during the consultation period
much of what they said is reflected within this policy
i would like to reflect for a moment on what the driving force of this policy is
this policy meets those criteria
article 24 reminds us that there must be increased participation and improved capacity of inuit firms to compete for business opportunities and government contracts
this policy achieves this objective
similarly in the bathurst mandate two of the key goals are to encourage self-reliance and to build healthy communities
the business incentive policy is a vehicle to reach those objectives
this policy ensures that the residents of nunavut share and benefit from every public dollar spent in this territory
that s what we re trying to do
interpretation ends much like our land claim this policy is a living breathing document
it is not static it recognises that to be successful a policy has to be flexible and responsive to the needs of the people it serves
this policy does just that including an ongoing review process that meets not only the needs of the government but also the business community while implementing both the spirit and intent of the land claim agreement
in short mr speaker the policy is a step forward in meeting the objectives and principals of the nunavut land claim agreement and the bathurst mandate of our government
interpretation i will be open to hearing any suggestions before we make the final version

clarification on fuel price increases
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i rise today in order to clarify the situation with respect to the increased price of fuel and to assure nunavummiut that we too are concerned
mr speaker i feel this is necessary as a result of the tone of some of the comments being published outside of this house and in response to the concerns raised recently by my fellow members
this is why i rise today
interpretation ends mr speaker i would like to summarise how we arrived at the situation and try to clarify some of the variables
of course some of the more detailed information will be provided in a proper format to those members who have specific questions
one of the hardest decisions we ve had to make recently involved this price increase
in fact mr speaker as the minister of finance previously stated the increase was kept to the absolute minimum
i would like to point out that this is only the second price increase since 1991
mr speaker i think we have done a good job at holding the prices steady while the market has been going up and down for a number of years
in order to be able to control price fluctuations we used a price stabilisation fund with a maximum dollar value of 5 million dollars
mr speaker this means that in a bad year we can if necessary absorb losses of up to 5 million dollars without a massive impact on pricing
unfortunately even with expenditure reduction in operations & maintenance and capital the deficit in this fund has been growing steadily
this is a direct result of trying to hold the line on prices while subsidising all products up to a total of 9 6 million dollars
mr speaker when the costs for this year were totalled we were faced with having to make a very difficult decision
every dollar used to subsidise these costs has to be removed from other potential programs
we were also in danger of exceeding the maximum allowable dollar value in the price stabilisation fund a maximum of 5 million dollars
we are not allowed to exceed this maximum amount
mr speaker i would like to provide some information on points of interest
there is a minimal product left in inventory just prior to the fuel delivery when the prices were calculated for this increase they were averaged over all the fuel received in addition to the remaining fuel left in inventory
this allows us to spread the higher costs over all the fuel
if we calculated the price only on the new fuel received we would have required a larger increase to cover the cost of only that fuel
this helped keep the increase as low as possible
if we were to consider providing any kind of additional subsidies these additional funds would end up coming from other programs
this is one of the reasons i had suggested the possibility of assistance for registered hunters through an nti funding program
mr speaker our fuel and transportation costs have risen an average of 33 3% for the recent sealift season
we are forced to pass on a percentage of this increase
we have also experienced a loss as a result of division due to the smaller quantities of fuel we now purchase
the larger the volume the lower the overall cost
the decrease in volume as a result of this and other factors was approximately 20 million litres
finally mr speaker in addition to the price subsidies we are already providing our own costs have risen as we are one of the major consumers of petroleum products through our departments
this increase has also impacted our operating funds
mr speaker i am very pleased that the members brought this topic forward in this house
this gives us the opportunity to respond directly to our constituents
in the future mr speaker as indicated by my honourable colleague the finance minister we re completing a review of our entire petroleum products operation
we will be providing the information to the financial management board in june of 2000
mr speaker we intend to go even further in order to determine whether there are changes we can make that will help us rein in some of these expenses
unfortunately we must also be aware that a large part of our cost structure is subject to the same pressure as the rest of the world
that is the price of oil in our world market
mr speaker i hope this statement helps clarify a few of the many pressures facing the petroleum products division in the area of pricing
once again i thank the regular members for highlighting this issue and giving me the chance to respond in a proper forum

p-3 update
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
among other things this includes major infrastructure requirements for the government of nunavut such as health care facilities
mr speaker as this assembly is aware on april 1st of 99 the government of nunavut inherited four potential health care projects from the gnwt
new health care facilities were planned for rankin inlet arviat iqaluit and cambridge bay
in may of last year we successfully concluded negotiations that allowed us to enter into an agreement with the arviat development corporation for the construction leasing and maintenance of the arviat health centre
construction on a new health centre was stopped in august when fuel oil was found to have contaminated the excavation site
the contractor commenced cleaning operations until winter weather conditions prevented any further soil removal for site restoration ninety percent of the contaminated soil has been removed to date and construction of the new facility will recommence in the spring
it is expected that it will be completed this november
mr speaker considerable progress has been made with regard of the development of the other three potential health projects
in may 1999 the financial management board approved a project to prepare a set of policies and procedures to guide the government in the development award and management of p3 projects
the financial management board also approved an initiative to undertake a separate but related study to evaluate the status quo of the other p3 projects
the policy and procedures study is virtually complete and a draft of the consultants report is currently being circulated to the departments of finance and public works for review
the evaluation study is completed and the government of nunavut departments have reviewed the report
mr speaker the three remaining health care facilities present some challenges
all three projects were at various stages of the planning process when they were inherited from the gnwt
our new government in some cases did not have the opportunity to approve the functional plans establish p3 management teams nor to develop business cases for proceeding with these new health care projects under a p3 arrangement
mr speaker despite these difficulties the government of nunavut has taken action to ensure that all outstanding issues related to the preliminary planning process are resolved
in december 1999 the department of finance and administration re-opened discussions with the sakku investments corporation qikiqtaaluk corporation and the kitikmeot corporation
this allowed us to establish service contracts to complete the remaining work and bring these projects to the stage where informed decisions can be made to proceed or not to proceed with the construction of these facilities
currently the department of finance is finalising the terms and conditions of these contracts with the birthright development corporations
we hope to have these contracts in place to complete the work within the next two weeks

newfoundland and labrador face many problems similar to ours in their efforts to provide health and social services in their province
they have expressed interest in sharing their experiences in the development and operation of their tetra telemedicine centre with us
mr speaker i am pleased to announce we are in the early stages of developing this mou with memorial university
queensland like nunavut has remote communities with extreme environments
they have faced many of the challenges we are facing and will share their solutions with us
this is an exciting opportunity to learn from an existing network in a new and fast paced technology environment
mr speaker as a government committed to the health and wellbeing of our people it is to our benefit to explore these opportunities and learn from national and international experiences

quarterly municipal funding
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
when we met with municipal leaders and administrators in november 1999 community leaders requested that the government advance its municipal operating contribution on a quarterly basis
until now municipal contribution funding has been forwarded to hamlets on a monthly basis for a number of reasons
it was the position of the gnwt that monthly contributions were more effective because among other things it gave the territorial government greater control over many community finances
last year the new government of nunavut listened to the expectations nunavummiut had for their government
the result as you well know was the bathurst mandate
mr speaker the bathurst mandate lays out the principles from which we shall govern
among these principles are two that i believe are important to the issue of community funding
the future of healthy communities depends on people being responsible and accountable for their own well being and we ll work within our means to provide for the needs of our families and communities
mr speaker i would like to announce that communities meeting the departments financial reporting criteria will be eligible to receive quarterly funding once the main estimates have been approved
mr speaker quarterly payments are the best way for helping communities meet the bathurst mandate initiatives for healthy communities and self-reliance
it will give communities greater authority responsibility build capacity and enhance control over their financial well being
it will make communities more accountable to themselves and it will allow communities a greater opportunity to generate revenue based on the potential they can earn on the advanced funds
mr speaker the department of community government and transportation supports quarterly payments as one way in which nunavummiut can take charge of their own affairs and their own futures

open custody contractors conference
hon jack anawak
thank you mr speaker
as members are aware the department of justice has approved a number of community based corrections facilities over the past three years five open custody camps one open custody home and two alternative homes have been approved across nunavut
these facilities will allow low-risk offenders to reside in a less restrictive environment and they aim to help offenders gain skills on the land and become more involved in the communities
these facilities are an important aspect of our efforts to deal with our offenders both youth and adults in a more appropriate and effective way
it is another way that communities are taking a direct role in justice
these facilities are run under contract and the contractors are skilled in running their facility
however they have not had the opportunity to meet as a group to share their professional approaches nor to meet together with department of justice officials to discuss the new procedures for their facility
mr speaker we are therefore holding a three-day conference for open custody contractors in iqaluit this month
the purpose of the conference is to provide an opportunity for open custody contractors to meet with each other and with corrections staff
interpretation mr speaker delegates will include department of justice representatives from each open custody facility community contacts from communities with open custody facilities and presenters from groups such as the fire department and emergency measures
our move to open custody facilities is a significant response to the need to keep low-risk offenders out of jail and to give communities more responsibility in caring and counselling for individuals with problems
conferences like the one this month will help to ensure the most effective operations of these facilities in that the most effective operations of these facilities is in the interest of the offenders and our communities

curriculum initiatives
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i m pleased to announce several curriculum initiatives which will begin to improve the quality of education we are delivering in our school system
the quality of education is dependent on the quality of curriculum and the resources we provide to deliver courses
good curriculum ensures better teachers and promotes improved achievement levels
education nunavut is mandated to provide curriculum that is embedded in inuit qaujimajatuqangit that promotes strong bilingual language skills that is holistic and integrated and that reflects the culture of the students and community
this mandate requires that we make significant changes not just in what we teach but how we organize schools
the critical research studies in language and the instruction curriculum resource development strategy will help the early childhood and school services division develop long-term plans to meet the needs of students in nunavut
however we already know that the existing curriculum has significant gaps
there is no curriculum for inuktitut innuinaqtun or second languages
there is no curriculum about nunavut
there is no curriculum designed to help our students cope with the rapid changes and significant challenges which they face daily in our communities
for the last thirty years inuit educators have been promised curriculum and resources for teaching in inuktitut
the federal government has funded this work yet after thirty years there is very little to show for it
the other consequence is that our children have been deprived when our teachers are resigning from their work
they are exposed to a southern school environment at the expense of their history language and culture
we know too well the effect de-culturation has had in our communities we must act mr speaker
mr speaker we must produce inuktitut resources immediately for our classrooms
i am pleased to be able to announce that significant work in this area has been accomplished since april 1 1999 for the opening of the new school year
in nunavut we will be able to have curriculum and resources available for all grade levels for inuktitut language arts
the work is not nearly complete but we have begun
interpretation ends we require second language curriculum for english french inuktitut and innuinaqtun
development of these curricula is awaiting the recommendation of the language of instruction research
mr speaker in the meantime staff are preparing guidelines and benchmarks for second language courses which will be available to teachers for the new school year
our children need to learn about their rich heritage and unique environment
nunavusiutiit will be the social studies curriculum that allows for children to learn about and to take pride in who they are and where they live
if we do not begin to define nunavut others will do it for us
we need to be the ones doing the teaching both for ourselves and for students outside nunavut
our students need to have a strong sense of who they are a positive understanding of their place in the world and the knowledge they are equipped to cope with the changes and challenges that face them
inuqataginiq is another new curriculum that will help address these needs
so many of our students are at immediate risk that the need for a course that will help them develop skills capacity and strong collective cultural identity is critical
interpretation mr speaker although we have many other projects on the go i want to focus on the three that are most essential
these three areas have been identified as high priorities for ecnss however we also face significant funding issues
curriculum design and development is a long and costly process
we require extensive collaboration with elders resource people school-based educators students and parents if we are going to do the job properly
we must field-test new curricula develop assessment tools design guidelines and in-service workshops for teachers identify and produce resource materials to accompany the curriculum document
interpretation ends printing documents and distributing them to schools is an additional cost
ecnss has no actual budget for any of this work
we will be looking for funding and support for curriculum development so our students and inuit educators finally receive the support and the resources and the leadership they deserve

hall beach school addition
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will make sure that i speak within the time limit
mr speaker last week i asked the minister of education about the school addition in hall beach
the minister answered that this project has been delayed and the needs had to be considered along with all the other needs in nunavut
mr speaker i have learned that the plans were well advanced in the past over a year ago community consultations took place and an architect began on the plans for an addition
i m told that the drawings were three quarters of the way to being finished
when the project was stopped it is my understanding that all the projects were stopped by the new government
the only projects that were allowed to continue were projects where the work had already started
projects where contracts had been issued to a contractor to start site work or building or where there were serious health and safety considerations
mr speaker the arnaqjuaq school in hall beach was built for kindergarten to grade 9
since it was built we are offering up to grade 12 in hall beach but the school was not built with that in mind it has only eight classrooms
this fall there were 214 students in that school ten more than last year
mr speaker the school is full and the principal tells me that they are having to hold classes in the library
the new grade 10 to 12 programs are taking up space that was meant for the kindergarten to grade 9 program mr speaker

suicides in nunavut
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
here in nunavut our life has changed
our society has changed drastically and we have felt the effects back in the 1970s and after the 70s a number of young people mostly men have committed suicide
we would ask the different organizations that had certain responsibilities or delegate some other organization to look into this suicide issue
but since the 70s to now there s over 400 suicides
if we are looking at the statistics one small community has been wiped out by looking at the statistics
perhaps sometimes it doesn t impact on us since april 1st to today there have been 24 i know i m sure there s over 22 but there are about 24 now
so that wipes out one classroom that s an example
they re all over nunavut and i think the community leaders should perhaps address this issue more aggressively in order to help their young people
i would urge the leadership to be more sensitive to the young people in their communities as to how they should address this very serious problem of suicide
i thank you very much mr speaker

inadequate education funding
mr tootoo
mr speaker i rise today to express my strong concern about the reduced funding for education
yesterday a class of grade 5 students at nakasuk school in iqaluit had to be cancelled because no substitute teacher was available
in nakasuk school in iqaluit for example the school is projecting an average class size of 31 for inuktitut programs unless there is some relief
these pressures of class size are taking their toll on our teachers as well
i know of several qualified teachers in iqaluit who have left their crowded classrooms to take office jobs with the government of nunavut in much less stressful situations
the loss of even one trained inuit teacher is a tragic setback for the goals we all support of enhancing the inuktitut language and culture in our education system
i am wondering if we need to consider providing financial incentives to teachers as we did to the nurses in nunavut earlier this year
the pressures are not just in classrooms our schools are very short of money for materials and supplies
our middle school aqsarniit which was opened to students this year had to launch a public appeal for books for its library in the 1992/93 school year there were 50 teachers for 850 students in iqaluit
this year there are 1 050 students in iqaluit but under the current formula the funding formula provides them with only 49 5 teachers
schools in iqaluit in the coming year because of the growth in enrolment will be short approximately 1 5 million dollars just to keep the same level of service as this year
mr speaker in recent news reports the minister of finance talks about a sizeable budget surplus for this fiscal year
today on cbc radio i heard him say that preliminary estimates indicate that the surplus could be between 30 and 40 million dollars
the government of nunavut has said that education and housing are two of its main priorities
i look forward to seeing these stated priorities reflected in concrete action

we bought that ski-doo and then we went camping and hunting and at that time i don t believe he had any children when he went to uqsuqtuq and when he left they had children

possibly what i can do is provide a preamble
we the inuit had a tradition where guns were used to provide food on the table and for survival
the gun legislation of today is totally against our traditional life style

the federal government through the use of the rcmp is working on the gun control legislation and they had a community tour but i had no opportunity to meet with that person
i apologize and i don t know exactly what came about in regards to gun control regulations
there were going to be community consultations and i apologize that i could not have a meeting with that person
possibly what i could do is get in touch with that person and give you the information afterwards

mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the reason i m asking this question is because in october i believe you made a statement saying that you would have a meeting with the minister in ottawa
that s why i asked you about what happened at the meeting you had in ottawa
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i can use an example of where the people of nunavut could have exactly the same rules and regulations but it has to be made easier because we buy guns for hunting purposes and not for anything else
this is the example that i gave at that particular meeting that i had with the canadian justice minister
i was trying to find out how he could make it easier for the inuit when were trying to get our guns from the rcmp
speaker interpretation
thank you minister anawak
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
to put a supplementary to the minister of justice in the land claims agreement it states that the inuit of nunavut do not require a license or have to pay fees and that s specific in the land claims agreement
my question is did you know that there was such a clause in the nunavut land claims agreement and how is it going to be implemented by the nunavut government rules and regulations
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
minister of justice mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
i believe that this was going to be one of the questions that would be posed to the person when he was doing his community tours
i will make that one of the questions when i talk to them
he was going to be talking to the people of nunavut about the fees and so on
speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr kattuk
mr kattuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
again in our ridings there are a lot of people out there who don t know about the gun control regulations and the legislation
what is this 25 dollar fee used for
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
the 25 dollar fee is used for the administration done by the retailers or whoever is administering the process
the rcmp member who was going to the communities said it doesn t have anything to do with what the rcmp did it s something that the hudson bay company does or the retail outlet that administers those types of things
it doesn t have anything to do with the government it s an administrative fee charged by the retail outlets

decentralization of arctic college positions
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is back to the minister responsible for education and also arctic college
mr speaker in the fall session the minister made a commitment to myself and other members in this house that on july 1st 13 jobs would be decentralized to my home community of arviat
these would be arctic college jobs
mr speaker i would like to ask the minister if this commitment is still as promised and stated in the fall session

mr speaker we re more than pleased with the support and the effort on behalf of the premier in reference to jobs that have been decentralized and promised to our community
i think it is important that we keep sight on what is committed that we keep following up so it does actually occur
my second question to mr okalik is can you give me a time frame that i can relate back to the people of my community so that i can have an idea
when do we expect the accommodations to be ready or found
thank you mr speaker
speaker

question 185 - 1 3
ntpc cut-off process
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question will probably come out in two parts mr speaker
mr speaker i have a question for the minister responsible for ntpc
i believe there s a rule or regulation coming from the ntpc where after 48 hours late payment their power will be cut off
looking at the north and extreme conditions it s very very serious if the water pipes break because the costs go way up
is the minister going to be making a change to that 48 hour late payment cut off
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i appreciate the question so we can clarify the situation around that notice
what happens mr speaker is the notice is sent out from headquarters in hay river and it still gives the consumer or the customer six weeks to pay
on that notice it says if it s not paid in a certain amount of time their power will be cut off
as we know mr speaker we do not cut peoples power off in december or january when it s 40 below
so there are options mr speaker available to the customer after they receive that notification thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker it s probably like that from your vantage point but when you re at the community level it s different
will your headquarters employees follow through with the orders and all that you have mentioned
when the bill finally arrives into the community it s already overdue
is there something you can do mr minister
speaker interpretation
thank you
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker just give me an opportunity to maybe clarify the situation
when the customer receives their bill and they hadn t paid it the month before they will now get a notice from the power corporation saying you have a certain period of time to pay your bill
you have that opportunity to do that before any power is cut off
it s not that you receive the bill in the mail and then the power is cut off
so there are considerable opportunities to do that
after saying that mr speaker the nwt power corporation is a crown corporation we have 33% ownership as the members know
the nwt government has the rest 67% of the ownership of the power corporation and this is a business decision made by the power corporation
it is not a decision made by this government

thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the staff have already been consulted on the way to deal with arrears on people s accounts
there is a format in place to deal with that

that was not a decision made by the government of nunavut that was a decision made by the corporation itself at its hay river head office

polar bear hunting regulations
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to ask a question of the minister responsible for sustainable development
when there are polar bear defence kills or if a female with cubs is killed the disposal of the hide is the responsibility of the hunters and trappers
in my community of taloyoak there are now two polar bear hides as a result of these types of situations
unfortunately these hides cannot be sold
i m wondering if the government would be willing to look at the regulations and policies regarding these situations
speaker
thank you
minister of sustainable development
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i believe he is asking if we are going to be reviewing the policies
we agreed in the past and we made this announcement about the hunters and trappers regulations and policies within our department
the hunters and trappers in the communities and the sustainable development department have an agreement in regards to dealing with polar bears
the policy that you have just questioned has been reviewed and once we have consulted other communities then we will review the other policies that affect all the communities in nunavut
speaker interpretation

cost of medical travel
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
regarding the newspaper there is about a 20 million dollar deficit in the health boards combined and accumulated over 2 years and we know about the high cost of fuel and transportation in nunavut

mr speaker i can t give him the actual cost for this year because this year is not finished yet
this year won t get finished until march 31st but what i can say is that approximately 20% of the health boards budgets go toward the expense of medical travel

mr akesuk
question 193 - 1 3
extra funding for housing authorities
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have a question for the minister of housing
my question is mr speaker the housing associations in the communities have limited funds and they always encounter this problem each year and some community members are in arrears
they are in arrears because some of them aren t employed and mr speaker it is difficult to collect rent from people who are having trouble finding jobs
it is difficult to maintain housing inventory which is getting older and older housing authorities have to put their operating and maintenance money into temporary repairs but budgets for preventative maintenance and major repairs are getting smaller and smaller
my question to the minister has the minister been able to find extra funds to help local housing authorities with operations and maintenance in the current year

mr speaker my question is for the minister responsible for finance and it relates to the newspaper coverage of the 30-40 million dollars or the radio coverage of the 30-40 million dollars surplus that we may anticipate

thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister of finance hon kelvin ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker one has to recognize that as i indicated this is one time 1999-2000 unexpended funds
the primary reason as members know is the fact that we are at about 75% staff at this point so there are significant under-expenditures in those areas throughout government
that situation will rapidly change given that we are constantly filling positions and expect to be at higher levels of staffing for the 2000-2001 year
ideally we would be at a 90%-95% level which is probably a historical operating level of government in respect to staffing
so i think it is important to recognize that i m sure that our union friends are undergoing collective agreement negotiations now with our government and i understand that situation as well
otherwise we would operate in a deficit situation and i don t think any members of this house would want to operate under those conditions mr speaker

item 11
replies to opening address
mr nutarak interpretation
mr speaker i am going to read my reply to the commissioner s opening address
mr speaker i am very pleased to reply to the commissioner s address
i would like to tell my constituents what i have been doing as their mla since i was fortunate to be elected about one year ago
first i want to point out some very important needs in my community of pond inlet
these needs are for new buildings
the needs in our communities are urgent
i think this is partly because when nunavut was created on april 1 1999 the new nunavut government took over from the old northwest territories government
we were very happy to see the creation of nunavut
however the way we see it when the new government took over from the northwest territories government the capital planning process was interrupted
under the gnwt the hamlet of pond inlet worked very hard on a five-year capital plan
we were very familiar with the five-year capital plan
it seemed that as we prepared for nunavut the five-year plan was forgotten by the gnwt
then when the nunavut government took over it seemed that the planning started all over again
some important projects got delayed or forgotten
this year s budget was not really the budget of the government of nunavut
it is only a budget for one year
the minister of finance has said that we will only be able to work on a five-year capital plan after we have finished the budget for this coming year
so the long-term plan the five-year capital planning process was interrupted when we moved from one government to another
we have several buildings in our community that as a result of the interruption of the capital planning process these old buildings which needed renovation or replacement have got older and are now very much in need of repair
a very good example is our takijualuk school the school got so run down that it had to be closed
other buildings that are suffering from neglect are the community hall the arena and the health centre
although these buildings have not had to close down yet they may not last very long
something has to be done very soon
community hall
the community hall was built in 1977 it is now older than half the population of pond inlet
the insulation in the building is very thin and some parts of the walls are not insulated at all
the situation is so bad that every winter if we have enough snow we insulate the outside of the building with snow to help with the heating
the building was renovated about 12 years ago but those renovations were only done on the outside of the building
inside the building the person who was doing the renovations pointed out that there was a very serious problem with the roof
every spring there have been serious leaks in the roof when it starts to melt
these leaks have meant that there is hardly any insulation in the roof
when the roof leaks as it does every spring the lighting and electrical wiring is damaged by water the hamlet must close the building when there is water in the electrical system and lights
mr speaker this is a very important building in our community this is the only place where children and young people can come to play freely
the community has a strict rule against drugs or alcohol in the building so our young people our young children feel comfortable and welcome in this place
young people are in this building all the time this is where they gather for dances or to play games such as pool table tennis or video games
this building keeps many of our young people from getting into trouble
the community hall is important for other reasons this is the only place where we can have public meetings and this is the only place where we can have feasts and community celebrations
this is the only place where the nunavut court of justice can have court
mr speaker this very important building is falling apart
the mayor has told me that the hamlet spends so much time and money fixing this very old building sometimes he just feels like giving up and closing the building down
the terrible thought of having no place for our young people stops him from closing the building down
the hamlet is very concerned with the huge amount of money they are spending to keep the building open
these costs are putting a lot of pressure on the hamlet budget
the money is being spent on keeping the building repaired and causing other hamlet programs to suffer
the mayor is also worried that the problem with the electricity and the sewage tanks mean that the building might be found to be unsafe or unhealthy
arena
our arena was one of the first arenas built when the government of nwt started building arenas in communities
the pond inlet arena was built as a pilot project
unfortunately it was not a full size arena and we as a larger community are entitled to a full size hockey rink
government officials have told us that we are entitled to a full size arena
right now having a small arena means that we can t ever host hockey tournaments
if our hockey teams want to play in tournaments they always have to travel to other communities
if we participate in regional games we always travel to other communities
we can never host tournaments or regional competitions
our old arena is also very poorly insulated so the building is very cold
my constituents are very concerned that it is not good for people to be breathing in such cold air
while they re skating it is not good for people to be sweating in such cold air
since we have these problems with two old buildings which are below standard we have suggested that it would make sense for the government of nunavut to combine these needs into a new building
this would meet our very pressing needs for a proper community hall and arena and it would also save money
it should cost much less to combine these needs for planning and construction rather than building two separate facilities
new health centre
our community has been fortunate to have a resident doctor and her family move in last fall
we were very pleased to welcome dr demaio to our community and we would like to tell the minister of health and social services this is very much appreciated
i would like to point out that the new doctor does not only serve the residents of pond inlet she also visits other north baffin communities from her base in pond inlet
we are concerned however that our health centre is old and too small for a growing population
the health centre will be under even more pressure when new jobs for government are received and more families are put in place in pond inlet
mr anawak the minister of community government and transportation and the minister of finance have been told of our pressing capital needs
we are very hopeful that these needs will be reflected in the coming year s budget and built into the government of nunavut five-year plan
mr speaker i thank you for the opportunity to explain these needs to my fellow mlas and the people of tunnuniqmiut through this reply to the commissioners address

mr speaker i wish to table this document titled subsidy by territory customer class and product this document covers the nunavut territory for the period of 1998/99 the last full year for which figures are available
this will highlight the amount of funding that the government of nunavut contributes as a subsidy for all products sold
perhaps this will also clarify that fuel is already highly subsidized as it currently stands

mr chairman last year the loan authorization act set a limit of ten million dollars for the current year and out of that ten million dollars to date there has been 5 2 million dollars of commitments made
it is felt that we will not need as much for the 2000 and 2001 fiscal year and hence the lower limit in respect to authorization requested for next year

thank you mr chairman

thank you mr minister
you made a very good recommendation
we will move that to tomorrow s schedule
we have two other items
mr minister you can make your opening comments now and submit the report tomorrow
please proceed
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman it gives me great pleasure today to begin the opening comments on the ikuma report
the ikuma report was commissioned to look at various options available to the nunavut government to provide electrical power to nunavummiut
the two main parts of the report describe
the possible structures for a nunavut power corporation with an analysis of the pros and cons of each structure
general policy and regulatory issues associated with power rates and subsidies that must by decided by the people and the government of nunavut
that s us mr chairman
in regards to the actual structure the ikuma report favours the crown corporation model for a number of reasons
those reasons are mr chairman
simplicity - it already exists in legislation - we have it on papermore flexibility - it can create its own policies to meet business needs rather than being limited to general government policy
something like we are seeing with the situation in clyde river today
with the possible rate increase that you have brought up mr chairman and articulated very well in this assembly
mr chairman the report does not provide specific recommendations about a number of questions many of which will be the subject of the next phase or implementation work
some of these questions are
- how much capacity can the nunavut power corporation develop between
now and april 1 2001
what level of outsourcing or third party contracting will be necessary for the nunavut power corporation to be operational by the year 2001how many headquarters positions will be created and where will they be located mr mclean
mr chairman over the last couple of days we have had an opportunity to see the pre-feasibility study about the high voltage transmission line from manitoba and into kivalliq and that is one example
there are others such as wind and solar technology fuel fuel cell technology as well as heat recovery initiatives that increase efficiency of current diesel operations
mr chairman as we consider these options we must look twenty to thirty years into the future
mr chairman we will need to consider and answer these questions and more during this transition period
now the next phase mr chairman in establishing the nunavut s own power corporation has already begun
indeed mr chairman it had not been advertised in the south either
we followed up on that recommendation from the standing committee
the president s position is currently being advertised and it is anticipated that someone will be in place by early april
i anticipate mr chairman that we will have preliminary recommendations on some immediate operational issues raised in this report within the next eight to ten weeks
these recommendations will provide some insight into the number of headquarters jobs that could be established
where these headquarter jobs will be located and the level of outsourcing mr chairman which is the key issue here - outsourcing that we will require in order to best serve nunavut
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
there is not enough time today to get into any other matters can i have a motion to report progress

point of privilege
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today on a point of privilege
mr speaker a reporter for the rankin inlet bureau of the cbc radio inaccurately represented yesterday s question period during this morning s news broadcast
specifically this reporter in her news story reported that five members of this assembly questioned me on the estimated budget surplus
mr speaker i would like to clarify to my honourable colleagues that only two members of this assembly questioned me on this very important matter
furthermore this reporter stated and i quote many were upset that they hadn t heard about the size of the surplus earlier unquote
mr speaker my colleagues will recall the subject of an estimated surplus was disclosed to my colleagues earlier this month
during yesterday s question period my honourable colleague for arviat accurately noted this fact
however mr speaker the cbc reporter failed to reflect this accuracy in her story but chose instead to report that members had not previously been informed of this matter
mr speaker the notion that my colleagues were frustrated and upset by this does not in any way accurately reflect the proceedings of this chamber
mr speaker when media misrepresents the proceedings of this house it is something that all members of the house should be concerned about
it is a violation of parliamentary privilege that all members of this assembly take seriously
mr speaker this morning s distortions of the truth as reported by the cbc radio are irresponsible unacceptable and do not respect this house or the members of this house that work diligently to serve the people of nunavut
i humbly request that hansard be reviewed once it is published and i further request that you come back to this house with recommendations on how we can ensure that members privileges are not violated
it is only in the best interests of this assembly to have accurate representations of its proceedings
thank you mr speaker
>>>applause
speaker
thank you mr ng for your point of privilege
as members of this house are aware the fact that we are sitting in rankin inlet has resulted in the delay of the usual practice of producing the hansard blues the next day
when the blues are received we will review them and report back to this house in a timely fashion
before we proceed to the orders of the day i would like to give special recognition to anthony maningnaluk the sergeant at arms for the remaining portion of this sitting
mr maningnaluk has served the canadian rangers since 1992 and we are pleased to have him here with us today
we are also pleased to welcome our new pages from the alaittuq high school
they are silu ittinuar charlotte kusugak tamora nahangululik david niveatsuk pam pilakapsi and william tiktak

federation of nunavut teachers negotiations
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it gives me great pleasure to rise to update my colleagues on the latest developments of our efforts to conclude an agreement with the federation of nunavut teachers
late monday night mr speaker the negotiating teams of both the nunavut government and the federation of nunavut teachers reached an agreement for the fnt membership to ratify
if ratified teachers across nunavut will benefit from salary increases of 3 5 percent effective september of 1999 and a 2 75 percent increase effective september 2000 and another 2 75 increase effective september 2001
in addition the union membership will benefit from a one time professional allowance
this one time payment recognizes the value our government places on the important role that teachers play in our communities and in our classrooms
mr speaker members of this house acknowledge that it is very important for this agreement to be ratified
with this in mind it has been agreed that specific details of the tentative agreement will not be released until after ratification

municipal health & social services committees
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker from the release of the document footprints through to today there has been wide support for the integration of the three regional health and social services boards with the department of health
in a few weeks on april 1 2000 the operations of the health and social services boards will become part of the department of health
the reason for this integration mr speaker is reflected in the bathurst mandate in particular the themes of simplicity unity and building healthy communities
a tremendous amount of planning work has gone into the first part of the integration which is primarily administrative
staff from all three regions and headquarters have been working together to design health and social services as a single organization
mr speaker both my cabinet colleagues and staff from all these agencies have been very helpful in bringing us to the point where we are confident that the integration will occur without the disruption of services to the public
mr speaker although we officially integrate on april 1 the bulk of work is still in front of us
we are seeking to establish strong relations between the minister and communities and this is our goal
we want to build an effective sustainable system that is both clinically sound and consistent with the values and knowledge of nunavummiut
we are determined to put our efforts into a new partnership between the department and nunavut communities
mr speaker following consultation with many members here today i have held a series of discussions with all the mayors of nunavut about the formation of hamlet committees on health and social issues
the response has been very positive and i expect that most if not all communities in nunavut will soon have established these committees
these committees will facilitate discussion in their communities and between their communities and the department of health about their own community s priorities
they will also be able to work with us to make the best use of resources on behalf of nunavummiut
mr speaker when i say resources i mean the knowledge and skills of our staff of community members and other agencies and financial and physical resources of all the agencies working in nunavut communities
these discussions will be critical in determining how we will structure the system in the future
what role communities may play and how they may organise themselves to do it and how we should organize the department to make it work best
my department will support the work of committees with a financial contribution as well as information and orientation
our regional staff will be dedicated to helping communities build up their own capacity
mr speaker this working relationship with communities will form a major contribution to the reform of programs and services which is the final goal of integration
like every other jurisdiction in canada it becomes more and more challenging to maintain the same level of service that we enjoy today let alone improving it
mr speaker as you can see we are making progress towards making our health and social services system a made in nunavut one
i look forward to providing further updates to the members in the coming sessions

early childhood & school services workshop
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you
mr speaker i wish to share with members of the legislature an important workshop hosted by our early childhood and school services division in arviat from february 1 to 3 2000
the workshop was an initial opportunity for the early childhood and school services division program staff to meet with staff from the regional board offices for instance in the three different regions kivalliq keewatin and kitikmeot
the workshop began with the process of creating a strong team one that can work together and be creative productive for the benefit of nunavut students
facilitated by jose kusugak the team tackled the critical issues facing education in nunavut
over the three days the team worked to develop common aims a vision and action plans
as henry isuaqnik an elder on staff in arviat noted inuit means people thus enforcing the necessity for participants to see themselves as an important part of the team bringing about this change
the workshop produced a set of priorities and action plans
key are structural changes such as revising staffing policy to ensure that elders and knowledgeable resource people are able to be employed by schools
the implementation of inuit qaujimajatuqangit should be preceded by the development of strategy
we will move into the restructuring strategy carefully initiating plans first through selected schools in nunavut as a pilot project
this workshop marked a very strong and positive step to the work that will be done to reshape nunavut schools

summaries of nunavut statutes
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
mr speaker i am glad to speak about justice and the improvements for justice
the laws and regulations have been summarised and a document showing the terms and terminology of justice has been completed
the summaries are an important resource for inuit who want to understand nunavut s laws in their own language
this the first time such a project has been undertaken in canada and perhaps the first time in the world
this month the summaries are being distributed to the public libraries throughout nunavut as well as the members of the legislative assembly
the summaries have already been distributed to the members of maligarnit qimmirrujiit
electronic versions will also be made available to the nunavut court of justice library website
the department of justice will be updating the summaries and translations as the laws of nunavut are changed and in this way the summaries will continue to be useful
i am pleased that the nunavut department of justice has undertaken this initiative
it is another way in which we are attempting to make justice accessible to all nunavummiut

recognition of author simon tookoome
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
today i rise with great pride to deliver a member s statement about simon tookoome
mr speaker a book was placed in front of you today
it is simon tookoome s first book as an author titled the shaman s nephew
mr speaker i will read parts of the introduction
simon tookoome was one of the last inuit to live the traditional nomadic life in the far north
tookoome as he prefers to be known resisted government efforts to make him leave the land
he continued to follow the caribou and seals feeding and clothing his family from the land
however even he was compelled to join the rest of his people and he now lives in baker lake
nevertheless he has kept his sled dogs and continues to hunt and feed his family
he has also kept his language and only speaks inuktitut
his people know him as a skilful hunter a respected elder a justice of the peace a drum dancer and as we witnessed in june a master of the forty-foot whip
the world knows him as an artist whose works are shown internationally and his art graces a canadian stamp
tookoome is a leading artist from a generation of great inuit artists
remarkably the inuit had never before created art
they did not even have a word for it
the art developed during their time of great change as they entered the modern world
for some art was a product to sell but for others like tookoome it was also a way to express an ancient way of living and seeing
so tookoome has produced a body of art that is strange and wonderful
his story is equally strange and wonderful
so i would encourage us all to read this mr speaker
and yes he is here in the gallery today and yes he will autograph your book if you approach him and yes he will have some books for sale out in the lobby

travel to ittuarturvik
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i really enjoyed mr mclean s member s statement
mr speaker there is a very special area near taloyoak which has great importance to our residents
this place which is called ittuarturvik is cherished by our residents both as a traditional settlement of their ancestors and also as a place of beauty rich in natural resources
my constituents tell me that this place has more wildlife in greater numbers than taloyoak including marine mammals such as ujjuk s and whales
in english this place is known as lord mayor bay
inuit from taloyoak last lived there about 25 or 30 years ago there is still an old mission building there
in recent years families have started to camp there all summer and i am very pleased that more and more young people are coming to know and spend time in this rich peaceful place
at one point their boats have to be taken on the land along a difficult section of the river then to the ocean
to portage their boats a trailer is needed
for years community residents have used a small trailer which was once owned by department of sustainable development

the trailer was written off as surplus by the department of sustainable development years ago it is quite old and is now wearing out
last summer the trailer broke down on the trail i described
i would like the minister of the department of sustainable development to help my community to avoid this kind of problem in the future
i hope it will be possible for the minister to identify minor capital funds from his department in the coming year so this old trailer could be replaced
mr speaker this is not a huge capital project but it could mean a great deal to the residents of my community
helping them to regain to their links to their past at this beautiful dwelling place of their ancestors

hunting killer whales
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will watch my time
last summer in my community we saw bowhead whales
bowhead whales were observed and there were more than one and these bowhead whales were dead
i m sure they were killed by killer whales and afterwards when i went to iqaluit there were three more found dead which were killed by killer whales
the bowheads the skin of the bowheads which have muktaaq the inuit people took the best of the muktaaq for consumption
i rise today to speak about this issue mr speaker because although us inuit people don t usually eat food that has been thrown away we have been eating the muktaaq off the dead bowhead whales
mr speaker the killer whales are now killing the mammals in the oceans of nunavut if possible we would like to see the killer whales being harvested when they are seen
again i will be asking a question about this issue during question period

thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as the ministers were making their statements it was quite interesting to hear their comments and today i rise mr speaker under members statements to speak about an important project in my constituency of broughton island
this project is having some problems
this project is a business venture aqaumajuq fisheries which is the business arm of the broughton island hunter s and trapper s organization
four of my constituents in broughton island have been working on this business for clams and selling them in south baffin communities
four of my constituents were given training in diving and safety procedures
we are very happy to be involved in this growing new business in diving for clams and selling them in pangnirtung and iqaluit
we even dive for clams in the winter through ice
i know there is a good market for clams especially in winter
this new business should grow and succeed
i was very pleased that they were trained with the help of sustainable development and the kakivak association
i also understand that safety procedures were developed and are being followed
i also understand that their diving equipment has been maintained and kept in good condition with assistance of the department of sustainable development
i apologize today i will ask you to excuse me mr speaker i have been having problems with my nose all day

support for inuit cultural institute
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
although i have spoken about this since we arrived here we re quite proud to see the sergeant-at-arms
she has worked very hard preserving sewing of traditional clothing however although we see how hard she has worked we ve never really recognized her enough so right now i would like to recognize her again
you see the kayak right in the middle of the floor there it was made by the husband of the previous sergeant-at-arms who is ollie ittinnuar
i just wanted to point out how hard she has worked and how hard mr ittinnuar has worked preserving the culture and traditions of inuit
he has worked very hard on traditional hunting and i m sure you have heard that he has been involved with the icc inuit culture institute to preserve inuit cultures and traditions
we have to recognize these people for all their work
at this point although the inuit cultural institute still exists they have been lacking funding but currently they have been compiling and recording legends
mr ollie ittinuar has also been the icc chairperson and has documented inuit traditions and values
although we recognize his work we should be more respectful and we should give him more recognition of all his work
i know that if we re going to be thinking of getting heritage centres the inuit culture institute has worked very hard in this area and ollie ittinnuar i feel should be involved in that area of work
sometimes when they work together i know they have disagreements and due to disagreements there is no working collaboration going on
so if we are going to be reflecting inuit qaujimajatuqangit we should be giving more support to the inuit cultural institute and recognize these people who have worked very hard in preserving and maintaining inuit heritage
i know that mr ittinnuar values inuit traditions
i just wanted to state that

they are anxious to find a way to keep working

when we arrived in whale cove everything was scheduled and prepared and lots of people were waiting for our arrival
they were prepared and waiting for us
they re prepared for us to visit them no matter which community it is the smaller communities are anxious to meet with us and waiting for us with open arms
in the future we should visit and tour the smaller communities more often so they can recognize us as members of the legislature and we can be closer to the people of nunavut
for that reason i stand up to speak about this issue and i was proud to see the premier and the speaker going with us along with the mla for whale cove
i also would like to thank my colleagues for going over there
looking at the inuit people when we arrived there when i saw their faces i could see that they were happy to see us and it showed physically

resolution island clean-up
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker about 310 kilometres south of my constituency lies resolution island
this island has earned the dubious reputation of being the most contaminated military sight in the north
i think that island is in my colleague mr picco s constituency however i won t hold him responsible for that
the concentrations of pcbs on resolution island have been found to be up to 160 times higher than the canadian environmental laws permit
mr speaker the good news is that the site is being cleaned up through a five-year plan of the department of indian affairs and northern development
the even better news is that the work to clean up this remote sight is being done by our own qikiqtaaluk corporation the development arm of the qikiqtaaluk inuit association
i want to say how pleased i am that qc has been entrusted with this responsibility by diand
first of all they are employing and training a great crew of inuit from iqaluit and other baffin communities who have worked on this site for the past two years
so far 13 million dollars have been spent at this site
a very large part of this money has stayed in the north due to the enlightened approach taken by diand by contracting qc to do the work
qc has ensured that any employment and benefits have been maximized
on top of that qc is doing a very good job
mr speaker recently the resolution island senior management team reviewed last year s performance
i can do no better in the praise of the job qc did than quote mr scott mitchell head of the diand s contaminated sites office who was interviewed february 21 in the news north
he is quoted as saying everyone is viewing last year as a major success for what was done on the island said mr mitchell
they accomplished much more than was expected even with the discovery of the lead dump and the sea lift coming in a month late to our surprise they did it all anyway he said
mr speaker so far the contaminated soil has been cleaned stock piled and put into containers
the next step will be up to the nunavut impact review board
the board will have to decide whether the soil can be treated and cleaned up on site or whether it should be shipped south to be cleaned
speaker

is that the big picture
thank you

thank you mr o brien
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as i indicated in the past in trying to answer this question it is an anticipated surplus that we re going to have anticipated until the final year end takes place march 31st 2000
until such time as the auditor general audits the books of the government of nunavut and files his report some time in the fall of this year that is the time that the actual surplus will be confirmed
thank you mr speaker

oral questions mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker i don t mean to beat a dead horse here
we re a little short on questions here today so i will stay on this line of questioning
part of the projected deficit of the three health boards was 8 9 million dollars from i believe over the last year and a half two years
can the minister tell me whether this 8 9 million dollars has actually been spent thank you mr speaker
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr ng
oral question mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
could the minister further clarify this issue of the 8 9 million dollars
this amount has been committed or spent however you want to phrase it
this may be only semantics
if that is the case why was it not put into the supplementary appropriation that we did last week here
we debated it and passed it and i remember asking if there were more looming financial matters on the horizon that we d have to deal with
i believe the answer that i got was that it was hard to predict if we may have larger amounts that we d have to bring another sup forward for
i guess what my concern is is that if we re aware of this and it s in our hands and on the table why was it not put forth in the sup last week
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker primarily because of the reason that the money the savings in respect of where that will come from to cover off the 8 9 million dollars has not been clearly identified at this stage
five point two i believe is the actual figure from the department of health unexpended funds to be allocated to the regional health boards
so the matter of the 8 9 million dollars as i indicated earlier on the actual financial treatment of that hasn t been finalised yet
thank you mr speaker

stop work order on aqaumajuq fisheries

thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is to the minister responsible for the workers compensation board

mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is directed to the minister responsible for public works
mr speaker yesterday i was very pleased that the minister confirmed that she was committed to the principles of openness and responsiveness set out in the bathurst mandate
the minister said that she had not spoken to this reporter
mr speaker i spoke to the reporter earlier today and the reporter informed me that it was the minister s executive assistant who told her that the minister would not give any more interviews on that subject for those reasons
mr speaker my question is when the minister s executive assistant told the reporter that the minister would give no further interviews because she had given enough interviews already was her executive assistant acting on instructions from the minister

question 203 - 1 3
manitoba presentation on pre-feasibility study
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker this is not a question related to the media or cbc nor nunatsiaq news but they sure make things interesting
mr speaker my question is directed to the minister responsible for the power corporation
mr speaker on friday past i posed a question in reference to the recent pre-feasibility study that has been completed regarding the possibility of a power grid between manitoba and the keewatin
the minister indicated that given the fact that there was a delegation coming here from manitoba this week basically that he would wait to comment on it at that time
mr speaker the delegation did come they did make a presentation
unfortunately i don t believe that there was anybody from the executive side of the table from cabinet at that presentation
there were regular members at it and it was a very interesting and detailed report
mr speaker given the fact that the delegation did come and make a presentation provided a fair bit of detail can the minister indicate his thoughts or his feelings on this report
maybe he had an opportunity to speak to some of the staff after this presentation
thank you
speaker
mr o brien i am asking you to rephrase your question
you cannot ask the minister how he feels
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i will rephrase my question and i do hope the minister is feeling well
after all he is the minister of health
the minister i would assume has had an opportunity to review some of this information and i would like to know what he feels is the next step in this process
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
i am feeling fine thank you mr speaker
i did meet with the minister responsible for manitoba hydro when they were here and the delegation was here
i also met with the ceo for manitoba hydro
the presentation that the member talked about earlier they said there were no cabinet people available that we weren t there for that presentation
indeed mr speaker i attended a private presentation with my senior staff of the power corporation here on the manitoba pre-feasibility study for the power grid link to the keewatin region of nunavut

oral questions
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
thank you mr picco
i am not quite sure mr picco if you understood my question or whether you answered it
so i think it would have been helpful if you had been there
mr speaker again my question was what is the next step in this process
we have had a pre-feasibility study and it is my understanding and the minister can correct me on this there is another further detailed analysis and an environmental study required
given that situation where does the minister stand on this
thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it is manitoba s report it is manitoba hydro s report so i can t be accountable for what communities are included in the report and what communities were left out of the report
what i can say mr speaker is that the member is correct
the next step is a feasibility this is a pre-feasibility study the next step would be a feasibility study
so that would be the next step
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
my feeling is that i think it is about time that we got in the driver s seat and started taking the lead on this study because the benefits to this region and to nunavut are phenomenal
so mr speaker i would ask the minister what are his plans and in what way will his department be proactive in taking the lead on this very very important study thank you
speaker
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
this is manitoba hydro s report there were some people from the northwest territory s government involved in some aspects of it they did not do the report manitoba hydro did it
it s a technical study and all it says mr speaker in basic terms is that it is possible to build a hydro line but the cost mr speaker could be 350 million it could be 500 million dollars
mr speaker some of the things they talk about is every house every residence every business in the keewatin that would be supplied by this grid would convert to electric heat
mr speaker that is the prudent thing to do and that is what i as the minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation intend to do
over the next several months when that report is complete i will present that analysis to the member and to this house and for public discussion here in nunavut
thank you mr speaker

you have one more supplementary mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i am not going to speak to the point of order i am not quite sure if it s allowed at this point in time
that was what my question was in reference to
furthermore mr speaker it is my understanding that this was a public meeting open to the public
i don t think that any of us need a private invitation to attend a public meeting
thank you
speaker interpretation
thank you mr o brien
minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i couldn t agree more with the member
i think this government is being proactive
we have to look at the costs and the implications
it is very difficult for me as a minister of this government to commit this government to millions and millions of dollars until we know exactly what the costs will be
that s why we are doing the next stage mr o brien that is why we are going to do the comprehensive study of the manitoba report
on the public meeting mr speaker manitoba hydro officials through the clerk s office or whatever department they invited people if they wanted to see the report because there was interest in that here
there was a presentation and everyone had an option to go to view that report but my understanding was that it was for the ordinary members
there was a previous presentation made a few months ago and i wasn t able to attend that one because i was at federal/provincial/territorial meetings in the south
so mr speaker as to the member s question yes we are being proactive yes we will do the comprehensive study and yes mr speaker that study will come back to this house for review

this year since the beginning of this year january 1 the fuel price rates have gone up for the hamlet councils in the communities too

are you going to be looking into whether you can subsidize the hamlet councils for fuel for the three months since the price went up
thank you mr speaker

if we are going to be looking into these details since our fiscal year ends on march 31st if we can find the money for a subsidy program it will be for up to a full year
we utilize fuel less in the summer time than in the winter time
i cannot tell you whether we will subsidize january february march retroactively or whether it is for a full year
perhaps we could subsidize from january 1

mr speaker i would like to work with the department and i would like to thank them for supporting the pairivik fisheries
the minister has been giving support to the pairivik fisheries and since then the work order has been stopped by the workers compensation board perhaps due to safety concerns
the staff from the workers compensation board felt that our diving fisheries pairivik diving fisheries needed more training
i would like to ask the minister if your department would be able to give us support on the training part of it so that they can get back to work

please allow me any old time you want
we re talking about the divers training and also why did the wcb put a stop work order on these divers
for safety reasons
we re talking about training for divers and certification for the divers and these divers have been diving for 2 years now and they are very knowledgeable about their job
why did they do the stop work order
perhaps we need further training

thank you mr speaker i direct my question to the minister of justice
it s along the line of the question i asked about gun control
nti are responsible for the land claims agreement and the beneficiaries
we have to pay close attention to the beneficiaries so that they can follow the statutes
i was wondering if you have met with the nti in regards to gun control
thank you mr speaker

thank you mr kattuk
minister responsible for justice mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the government of nunavut is not really working on the gun control issue
we don t have that responsibility it s the federal government that has that responsibility through the rcmp
i myself have not met with the nti in regards to this issue but i have met with the person who worked in that area to find out how we can make it easier for gun registration
but the government of nunavut does not have the jurisdiction so therefore i have not met with nti

question 210 - 1 3
alcohol & drug treatment centres
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
my question today is to the minister of health
we re almost completed one year in our mandate mr speaker and a concern was brought up in my community about drug and alcohol treatment centres
does the minister responsible have any kinds of plans to open up any new treatment centres
because i think that there is in my feeling a need for these drug and alcohol and healing centres in nunavut
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister responsible for health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker this is a very interesting and serious topic in 1992 we opened up the first residential treatment centre in nunavut
at that time we projected that 216 people would need residential treatment each year at that centre here in nunavut
in actuality mr speaker instead of seeing 216 clients we saw 7 clients in 1994 34 in 1995 57 in 1996 25 in 1997 and 21 in 1998
a total of 119 patients in four years
mr speaker the cost of that program in 1998/99 according to the figures presented to me was 640 thousand dollars mr speaker
so what we re trying to do as a government is to analyse where we should be putting our resources
so that s the question mr speaker we re doing a review of that right now
most residential treatment centres in my understanding mr speaker in the north are closed
in the yukon the treatment centre is closed the northwest territory treatment centre is closed and indeed mr speaker the residential treatment centre in apex is also closed
we ve had four people so far this fiscal year
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
but sometimes the individual is in circumstances where an outpatient service does not provide the type of care they need
in some cases i would think that the person would have to be removed from the community to get away from the peer pressure of the alcohol drugs and inhalants
the minister replied to me that there are four people in the south
to me that is going against what we were talking about when we were creating nunavut was taking care of our own and looking after each other self-reliance and everything like that
does the minister foresee in the very near future having an institution or a little place that people can go to and rehabilitate rather than sending them south
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister responsible for health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker this has been a very interesting topic because there are different types of addictions
mr speaker there s the psychological and physical addiction to a certain drug or problem for example alcohol
for those with true addictions mr speaker the option of residential treatment is one that we ve been looking at in the apex treatment centre
but if we re going to treat people mr speaker we have to treat the whole person
taking ed picco out of hall beach or baker lake and putting him in iqaluit and then treating him for six weeks has been found not to work
that s why those treatment centres in those other communities have closed
if the member is asking me is this government contemplating opening up treatment centres in all of our communities the answer would be no
what we will do mr speaker is build a capacity which we are trying to do right now in each of our communities to be able to treat people with the different types of addictions that they have
the member is right some of those are drug addictions and some of those are alcohol addictions and so on
each addiction is different they can all be treated differently the different types of substance abuse that they re having trouble with
remember mr speaker let me make it clear that any person that needs treatment receives the treatment that they need
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions
final supplementary mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr speaker
so i encourage the minister to re-evaluate what he s doing in his proposal and when can we expect to see it
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister responsible health mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to begin by thanking mr mclean for his support in helping me with my addiction
mr speaker 119 people in roughly four years who went through the treatment centre in apex
the average cost per person at that time was 50 thousand dollars for a six-week treatment
mr speaker that equates to 6 million dollars over that four year period
i agree with the member i don t agree with taking someone out of their community and sending them south and that s why i m opposed i guess in certain ways to opening up the treatment centre
because over the last few years the studies have shown that if you take a person out of their community and away from their family and providing that residency treatment it doesn t work
because they relapse and that person has to go back to that same environment
i hope that answers the member s question

mr mclean
ma na uqaqti and my fellow colleagues
mr speaker i am pleased to rise today to reply to the commissioner s address
as of last week it s been one year since i had the privilege of being elected as an mla to represent my home community of baker lake
i still feel good for having been elected
this strong support that i have received from my constituency was overwhelming
i want to thank my constituents for having continued strong support and good advice
it s always difficult to single out certain people who were especially helpful to me because i know some will be left out
however i want to mention a group of people who have provided critical support and guidance and continue to be very valued advisors and supporters
i am grateful to all the elders of baker lake but i do want to make particular attention of some very special people barnabus pariour and his wife were very inspiring to me
mr pariour has recently been honoured has recently honoured our community by being appointed to the nunavut law review commission by the premier
i want to thank the premier for accepting this wise elder for such an important role
i want to thank the late titus ateetnat who sadly passed away not long ago
irene kiktalak is another valued advisor who has recently been honoured with a doctorate from the university of guelph
jacob akeenalik a strong member of my campaign committee and others who provided me with great support were norman atungaluk and sally and david webster
robert seeteenak was my able official agent and joe apaluktuk did a good job as my campaign manager
most importantly of all i wouldn t have run and couldn t have won without the strong support and encouragement of my wife emily and our children leean kyle and terrance
i know that i didn t get everyone s vote in the last election but i now feel that i represent the entire community
i believe that we will make progress in our community if we pull together as one voice to make a better life for our elders children and ourselves
i have been fortunate in the past year that i haven t had to be away from home for too long
that was the main reason i chose not to run for cabinet
the people of baker lake told me they wanted me to be accessible
i have opened an office in the jesse oonark centre so people can drop in and talk to me to give me advice and express their concerns
i am very pleased this is happening now
in this reply to the commissioner s address i want to first turn to some of the very important issues i promised to work on during my campaign
one of the key issues i spoke about was the need to create more jobs for the growing population of my community
decentralization of government of nunavut jobs in baker lake
when i was running for office i knew that the inuit leaders and the interim commissioner had committed to the decentralization of jobs in nunavut
i promised to work to ensure that some of these decentralized jobs came to baker lake where unemployment is very very high
my goal is not only to have these jobs created in baker lake but to have these jobs filled by the people of baker lake as well
i applaud his commitment
i have been working hard to ensure that there will be movement of government positions to baker lake once the new government office building is completed sometime in the year 2000
sport nunavut is already established in baker lake and is here to stay i might add
i am very pleased that 4 of those 6 positions have been filled like i said by long-term residents of baker lake
the development division of the department of community government & transportation will be moving 6 positions into baker lake in the near future as well
i am also very pleased that baker lake will be the headquarters of the nunavut library system and will acquire at least 5 positions along with support staff
i would like to express my opinion that nunavut should make careful plans to establish its own workers compensation board
this should be done in full consultation with those affected representatives of employers and workers who contribute to the workers compensation board and who benefit most from its existence
making a transition from the present joint nwt and nunavut workers compensation board will also undoubtedly require a period of intense negotiations
the elders in baker lake believe strongly that on the land programs at outpost camps can provide effective rehabilitation for certain offenders young and first offenders and those serving the last part of their terms
i am expecting to see this program in operation this coming fall
i would like to acknowledge the key role of the baker lake justice committee
the outpost camp program also will recognize traditional knowledge and inuit qaujimajatuqangit by taking advantage of the wisdom and knowledge and compassion of our respected elders
these outpost camps will support and teach our young people their traditional economy and way of life
i give my whole-hearted endorsement to this initiative
i am convinced that more communities like this one in more communities will reduce crime
replacing the decrepit old falling down rotten jonah amitnaaq school
another issue is the deteriorating condition of the jonah amitnaaq school
this school was built in 1957
it is currently the oldest in nunavut and the northwest territories
this school is in bad shape and in fact it has started to literally fall apart
the situation was well described in a headline in kivalliq news on november 24 1999 entitled flirting with disaster
the story described how a light fixture fell from the deteriorating ceiling of a classroom of the junior high wing and crashed to the student s desk below
fortunately this happened just after the students were dismissed for lunch
this frightening incident resulted in the baker lake education council closing that wing for two months while temporary repairs were made
in the course of investigating the building evidence of asbestos was found
asbestos is not allowed in modern schools or any other buildings today because it is very dangerous to human beings
tests were done on various sections of hallway pipes in the school and they were found to have between 10 and 30% of serpentine asbestos fibres
mr speaker it is completely unacceptable that our school children should be exposed to such dangerous materials
i have been deeply concerned about this issue not only for the very obvious and serious health reasons but also because these concerns are a serious distraction to the students from their studies
i would like to thank the minister of education the hon james arvaluk for his concern and support about this issue from the first moment i approached him about it
i believe that addressing this serious and urgent problem is a priority for the minister and his department and i am looking forward seeing concrete plans to deal with this issue
community based health and social initiatives
my community also has pressing health and social needs
i believe that the most effective health and social programs must be community based and taking advantage of our people who have been taking good care of each other for thousands of years
a perfect example of this principle is the baker lake pre-natal program run by betty houston and laura pruver two long-term local residents
these dedicated women secured funding from the federal government to teach pregnant women and young mothers how to cook and use country food in a nutritious manner so that their babies will be healthier
the program is so successful i understand other communities are adopting it
it has also been incorporated into a health promotion campaign on cbc television
i want to commend these two residents for their hard work to make this program what it is
we know that one of the worrying trends is the health status of northern peoples and its premature and low birth weight babies
this program is working very well against this trend in baker lake and it makes very good use of one of our abundant natural resources country food
in my campaign it was also very clear that constituents want to see social issues addressed
one very strong concern was the need to hire and train an inuit mental health worker
people need counselling for depression sexual abuse and family violence
they have told me how difficult it was to talk about themselves and these very sensitive issues unless the counsellor can understand the language and culture
this knowledge is not something which can be learned in a southern university or school of social work
this is an example of the residents desire to take advantage of traditional knowledge about traditional healing
it seems so obvious to me that the people providing counselling and support must understand the language and culture of those seeking help
i am still waiting for results for this important request
i know that the minister and his department have been working very hard on the transition from health boards to the department of health and getting the department up to capacity
i will continue to push to deal with this need
i want to also make particular mention of donna brown the nurse in charge who has worked under trying circumstances in our community and i am very pleased she has recently committed to a new term in baker lake
we are very grateful to donna and her colleagues for their commitment to us especially as we know it is a time of nursing shortages in many parts of canada
supporting the traditional economy
another serious issue in my election campaign was giving more support to all aspects of what i call the traditional economy
i told carvers that i would try to find ways for them to get soapstone
i am therefore very pleased to note that this year through the community initiatives program of the department of sustainable development the hamlet of baker lake was allocated 10 thousand dollars to retrieve soapstone from jigging point
i am also pleased that a local man mark toongwak has been contracted to carry and deliver the stone to the new carving room just opened in the jessie oonark centre
this carving room was funded by the nunavut development corporation which is ultimately accountable to the minister of sustainable development
i d like to thank and acknowledge the hon peter kilabuk also for the generous contribution from his department for the baker lake prospector program which is chaired by my constituent andy
i hope this will an ongoing program because i know mining has great potential in that area
so mr speaker the traditional economy is alive and well
i am optimistic that with the continued support of mr kilabuk and his officials these programs will continue to thrive and flourish for the well being of all my constituents
i am particularly pleased to see support for these programs because the beneficiaries of these programs usually have large extended families
while i am very pleased about the support of what i call the traditional economy since i was elected there is still much much more to do
baker lake is known for its arts and crafts but we have other areas that rely on our own human resources as well
to create a solid economic base for our community we also need to support tourism
tourists that want to view nature the so-called eco-tourists as well as those who will come for sport fishing and hunting
handled carefully they will not only preserve the natural wonders but they will also support our traditional way of life the inuit language and culture
the world now knows about nunavut since the creation of the new territory
now we have to capitalise on this by getting the world to visit nunavut to buy our arts and crafts to view nature to hunt and fish
more of our people need to be trained as guides and supported as outfitters
our new nunavut government must develop stronger new strategies to take advantage of our natural resources and our strong traditional economy
i would like to see more support for tourism than is now in place in nunavut
tourism could be much stronger in all nunavut communities
i must say that i am not convinced we are spending our money as effectively as we could on tourism in nunavut
i would like to see more direct benefits to communities i would wonder if we are spending too much money on staff and travel and not on product development and promotion
is the department measuring the effectiveness of our spending in this area should our priority not be more community based initiatives more community tourism officers and local training programs
where we have potential for economic benefits in our community let s train people locally
isn t it better that we bring one instructor into a community to train 20 local people instead of sending one person out to a far away training program
if the meadowbank gold project goes ahead i will be urging our government to support community based training in areas like heavy equipment operators so baker lake residents will have first chance at these new jobs
northern benefits mean local jobs and training
community based training and creating new jobs are the key to achieving the bathurst inlet goal of putting people first
creating new jobs and the potential for mining
for my constituency realizing my campaign promise to look at ways of creating new jobs in my community requires that i look at the mining sector
with rich mineral deposits near baker lake i can see the potential for long-term job opportunities and mining
i understand that mr kilabuk s department has just completed a mining policy for nunavut
i wish to congratulate the minister and his department for this
clearly there must be a careful and orderly approach taken to examine every potential mining development and achieving maximum benefits for our residents
many of my constituents are optimistic about the meadowbank gold project of cumberland resources which is located close to baker about 70 kilometres north
mr speaker although the deposit is not huge this find is apparently the richest concentration of gold in north america
i have been in constant touch with the senior executives of the company expressing my very strong concerns about maximising local benefits to my community if this project goes ahead
this is the only way to maximise business and employment opportunities
achieving self-reliance
mr speaker one of the main objectives of the bathurst mandate of the government of nunavut is self-reliance
let s look at the enormous challenges this poses
how do we create 10 thousand jobs in nunavut
i think our government must take a realistic look at the potential of jobs in mining
i know that we must look at each project carefully
the nlca and the mandate of our nunavut and federal government give us the tools to
>>applause
i challenge our premier and his entire cabinet and our minister of dsd to take a closer look at opportunities at mining
if this meadowbank project goes ahead my community will be looking at about 120 jobs in the construction phase including maintenance of a road hauling fuel and supplies once the mine is built
we are looking at 70-80 jobs at the mine itself
this could have a profound and positive effect in baker lake which has suffered far far too long from at least half the people being without full time employment
i don t have to look far before i see other bigger opportunities in this region
people from all over the keewatin if they get trained should have access to these jobs
i believe we must press the federal government to give us their share of royalties from these resources
if our nunavut government is serious about self-reliance we must pay careful attention to any opportunity to create jobs for nunavummiut which will generate income tax revenues
we know how much we need sources of revenue in nunavut
how else are we going to provide housing power subsidies better health care better education for a rapidly growing population
we cannot rely on the federal government for money
we must look for every opportunity to create our own sources of revenue
when i ran for this office in this assembly i hoped i could work with the new nunavut government to make life better for the little people in nunavut
the long term residents people who don t always have a lot of formal education these are the people who make up more than 50% of the unemployed people in constituencies like mine
let us work together to make sure we don t lose an opportunity to create even one more job

mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we don t fully understand the report and the recommendations and because i am not too clear about the report i am not sure if i would be able to support the recommendations
i feel that i should be able to understand it clearly in order to support it
so as a government if we pass the motion without being too clear about the motion we would look bad later and start to regret our lack of understanding
so with that i wonder if we could deal with this at the next sitting so that we could have time to look through the report in more detail and have a better understanding of it
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
if you would rather deal with this in iqaluit if you would like to defer this item you could make a motion to defer this item to the next sitting of the legislative assembly in iqaluit
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
perhaps i should ask this question first before i make a motion
the documents that we have are a motion and if we approve it will we be following the recommendations
will we be implementing it as soon as it s approved

hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman
there is a long history there and i am not going to get into that
mr chairman the member is making a good point the ikuma report is over a hundred pages long and over the last couple of days many people have asked me about some of the points in the report itself
when we made this report public and to the members maybe more people need a chance to study it and debate some of the recommendations in it but we are not here today to accept the report
we are here to debate the report and to talk about it and to have debate about the actualities itself
the recommendations have been accepted and we re moving forward
as the members know i appeared before the committee the committee recommended that i advertise for the nunavut power corporation president because we didn t do that in the south or in the north
so that was one of the recommendations that we followed
we also have available the summary and the summary is about thirty some pages and that is a condensed version of the larger report
maybe that would help the member too for understanding purposes
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr picco
if the member would like to make a motion you could but before you do that you have to give other members the opportunity to ask questions and the motion will be after the questions
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
i ll give the other members a chance to ask questions and get back to my motion later
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
following the list that i have
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman my colleague brings up a good point in reference to the detail and in some cases the areas that are technical and complicated
having said that i ve had an opportunity to review the short version and vaguely went through the larger document
i m not concerned as to what is in the document i m concerned about what is not in it
we talked in the last week in reference to the price of fuel and we indicated that harvesters will pay an extra one million dollars to fuel their machines and equipment for their harvesting
the price has just risen over christmas
i m curious as to why the minister did not include that aspect in his study
it would seem to me that is first and foremost
we are in most cases totally at the mercy of other people and other countries when it comes to the pricing of our fuel
there is no guarantee that it will stop at thirty dollars a barrel which it s at now
i would assume the minister is looking toward trying to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels for many reasons
not only the price of fuel and it being unpredictable but also from an environmental standpoint
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr chairman thank you member for the comments and questions
on the first page of the summary that the member referred to you will see the reason for the report is spelled out and those reason are as follows
the options to assess the needs of nunavut s energy nunavut s future electrical energy needs
fundamentally the nunavut government must decide on one of two choices to continue with the northwest territories power corporation or go it alone
if the choice is to work out a shared arrangement with our western partners then several critical questions need to be met
so mr chairman the basic thrust of this report was to see if we needed to set up our own power corporation or should we stay with the west
the answer was we needed to move forward on our own power corporation and then the report flows into what we need to do logistically and administratively to look at setting up that power corporation
looking at alternative energy sources and so on were touched on in the report but were outside the scope of the report
so i hope that helps answer mr o brien s question on alternative energy sources and why they weren t touched on in the report because that was not the mandate of the report
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i just want to qualify my point and my comments
i know there was a very talented group of individuals that were pulled together to do this report
there have been many meetings and gatherings to come to this final conclusion
i just fail to see why the minister would not include this very important aspect of energy
i think it is very clear we have no control over the price of fuel oil and it would just seem to me that i would be logical that it would be included in the study
i commend you on the report but it s not what is in it it is what is not in it
it s obvious that this is not the conclusion of your study
when would the minister be contemplating on reaching out to this area
i think the time is here and there is no question in my mind and everybody else s that the sooner that we lower our dependency on fossil fuels the better off we will be in many ways
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr o brien
mr minister
hon ed picco
if you go through the report mr chairman you will see for example on the summary we talk about electrical versus fuel
we talk about the opportunities of economies of scale
another recommendation from the report was to integrate the petroleum products division into the new nunavut power corporation and that would save a lot of money because of the economies of scale
one of those options is the hydrogen cell actually there is a company working out of the keewatin i believe coming out of arviat or baker lake doing some work in that area
there is also the secondary stage drop type of generators
instead of having a generator in a river you can put the generator in a lake or pond and that can generate several megawatts of electricity
that was described in detail last week when we met with the manitoba hydro officials
we could go ahead and spend three hundred or four hundred million dollars to build a hydro line and the technology might move past that point like we re seeing in other countries or states like california
that was not a part of the report itself studying what options are available in the generation of energy
the report was predicated on finding out if we should separate or set up our own power corporation
the next step for the nunavut power corporation mr chairman would be to look at what mr o brien is talking about
but it is technical and they say it is technically feasible
they have not attached a real price tag for us
that is what we need to do now to see where we go from here
to get from point a to point b
i hope that helps answer the member s question
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister picco
mr o brien
mr o brien
thank you mr chairman my final comment
mr chairman i still have difficulty in accepting the fact that this wasn t included in such a major report
the minister has explained himself and i will have to accept that
i think to a certain degree we may have missed the boat
we could have got the jump on this issue sooner than later
we are not in a situation where we could and i think the finance minister would agree with that unless that surplus is greater than he is telling us to cover a project like this
i may have to ask the media about the amount of that surplus
minister given the fact that it would require federal dollars to take on a project like this what would your next step be
i know you have indicated the next step to further this along when do you anticipate this happening
when can we hope you would initiate another extension of the report before we spend tens and tens of million dollars of dollars replacing generators and so forth with existing plants and building new plants
in some ways we can get the jump on this and access some hydro from outside sources
if we could get the jump on this we would have these companies tying into this line we speak of which would help subsidize the cost of this
not only from an infrastructure standpoint but from the purchasing power i think this is an issue that is critical and i think it should be dealt with as soon as possible
i m somewhat disappointed that it wasn t included in the report
the fact is it is not
i would ask when do you anticipate taking the next step to review this
thank you
