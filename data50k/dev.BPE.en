chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr premier would you like to respond
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i know that we have already agreed we would come up with a single time zone and when we had our meeting in baker lake we also discussed this with the members of the legislative assembly
in august we stated that also
the regulations have been worked on since september 30 and myself i have publicized that changes to the regulations of the nunavut government and the federal government were made already
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i think we have discussed this here
however as to how we will arrang@@ e the time zones as mla s we have never been involved as to whose time zone we will follow whether we will lose 2 hours we ve never discussed that
i just wanted to state that as a supplementary
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
if you wish to respond mr premier
we are not trying to make corrections ir@@ respective of where you are in nunavut you have the right to call us and have access to us anyway just going back to the old arrangements it will be too cumbersome
we can only deal with o@@ d@@ d hours if you are from cambridge bay or if you are from iqaluit
we will probably be able to consider this again if a real problem did arise because of the new time zone
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
according to my list of members who wish to speak i ll start with mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
bill 3 was it in english inuktitut and french
i think it would be advi@@ sa@@ ble if bill 3 was in all these three languages
so i m asking the premier if this was done
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
isn t it in three languages
what are you saying
chairperson interpretation
mr nutarak would you like to clarify your question
mr nutarak interpretation
i believe we should have it in four versions
if it s in four languages and dial@@ ec@@ tal versions we would be able to pass it but it is only in 3 versions and we cannot pass it
i just want clarification on that
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
does anybody wish to deliver a response
mr nutarak if it is appropriate with you maybe the legal advisor for nunavut can give a response to you
mr nutarak interpretation
i have no problem with who answers it because i just want clarification on that
ms cooper
thank you mr chairman
the legal requirement for the proper passage of the bill is that it be introduced in two languages
english and french but certainly in my book it has the bill in four languages mr nutarak
i m not sure if yours does
chairperson interpretation
thank you ms cooper
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you
yes a response is given if it s in inuktitut and inuinnaqtu@@ un and if we re going to make it legislation for nunavut there will have to be three official languages for official questions to the legislation
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
i ll pass this again to ms cooper for a response
ms cooper
thank you mr chairman
if you were to want to make passage of the bill in four languages a legal requirement would be that it has to be done through a legislative change or amendment to the appropriate legislation
chairperson interpretation
thank you ms cooper
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
maybe to be brief with my comments
it is written in an english version and also i believe in french and inuktitut
i haven t seen the inuinnaqtu@@ un version that s just my point
as it says the central standard time as i asked earlier what exactly does it mean
during the session if it is going to be central standard time i think the wording should be corrected if it is going to be written in english french inuktitut and inuinnaqtu@@ un
on the inuktitut version if we have kitikmeot standard time yes there would be a difference of one hour
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
it is making reference to the central time zone
it is obvious the inuktitut version needs to be revised because in the english version you have central standard time but the wording in inuktitut refers to kitikmeot standard time
we have two different versions english and french but they have to be available in the regions so they ll have to be revised as to the exact wording
that was just a supplementary
if it can be revised i would like to recommend that it be revised
if the premier wants to revi@@ se then i ll agree with him including the whole content of bill 3
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes number 4 2 as it reads if this act receives assent as of october 31 1999 this act comes into force on assent even if it s not really as@@ sen@@ ted
as soon as it s as@@ sen@@ ted it will be in full force after october 31
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
as i mentioned earlier the different languages should cor@@ relate to each other
it states here if this act receives assent on or before october 31 this act comes into force at 2 00 a m it does not say before it only states october 31 first in inuktitut
if it was stated in inuktitut then i would agree with the premier
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
yes the translation requires amendment so that it can cor@@ relate with the english version
we can deal with that here and we are here to deal with it
the english is clear and self explanatory
the translation should just follow the english version
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
i did a have a question
i want to give other members an opportunity to voice their concerns as well
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i agreed with a single time zone in the previous days
this bill was tabled in april and i agree with all the reasons why this was brought up however today i understand the public s concern
in inuktitut it s liter@@ ally two hours
we are used to day@@ light savings time and another hour on top of that the public s percep@@ tion is that they understood they would move their clock back two hours because they are inuit using traditional knowledge
this is the very first time that we can actually speak to this issue for those of us representing constituents from the baffin region
we were able to discuss this during our member s statements but we were not allowed to ask questions to the issue
for that reason the people are concerned about the fact that they were not involved
they were not even consulted regarding the time change
they have petiti@@ on@@ ed against it and these petitions were tabled at the house during the official session
many people have signed them
when we went down to item 10 petitions during our tabling of documents item 13 in our orders of the day we were tabling petitions and tabling documents
in regards to this issue these are some of the things that we ve done
perhaps the petitions that came from the baffin are u@@ se@@ l@@ ess
it didn t even last an hour as our clerk had told us that even without the passage of bill 3 our clo@@ cks would still turn back
none of the regular members were smiling
all the faces changed dra@@ stically
mr irqittuq interpretation
does that mean that the government is going to control the inuit now
is the government never going to consider the concerns of the people
i know that this is going to create a lot of conflict
it s already to started to create conflict with the government
the kitikmeot and keewatin are happy because there s no negative impact with the time change but for those of us who live in the baffin region have felt the impact
and so therefore there s quite a lot of opposition throughout baffin island
if we don t listen to the people of nunavut we re not preparing their future
chairperson interpretation
we have to follow the rules
you cannot as a person in the gallery please be patient
you cannot che@@ er or do any cl@@ ap@@ ping in the house
please follow the rules accordingly
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
these are the issues i wanted to bring forward
the population of baffin island is the majority of nunavut and when we are given something that we oppo@@ se there s room and we have the right to oppo@@ se
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
as i have stated before we had set this up through the regulations and we tabled this information out to the public with the authority that was invested in us
i also would like to work with the mayors perhaps it s a bit too late tonight but i would like to discuss this with them tomorrow morning as to how we can proceed with this further
if we didn t change the time it would be going onto 7 00
i just want to remind everybody that we changed our clo@@ cks back an hour and i would like to work with all the members when we are consulting with all the communities
we have other issues to deal with too so we should move onto other topics
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
i forgot to mention one of the things we now have one time zone for the whole of nunavut so i know the offices are working a lot better now and we are ac@@ comm@@ o@@ d@@ ating them today
now@@ ad@@ ays we have high technology
we are not oppo@@ sing the single time zone for nunavut
igloolik residents and hall beach residents are not oppo@@ sing the single time zone
one thing that they have been requesting was that the single time zone should have followed the eastern standard time
that way we would have had a unified hour all across nunavut
that was the request in these communities
we would have had less impact with the kitikmeot
keewatin and baffin would have been happy that way
so we do have this high technology
we have better technology than gnwt had
therefore at this time in my community i know that it s the d@@ ark season but with this new time change we will be getting d@@ ark at noon hour
that s the impact that we are feeling in my community
our school students will be going to school after lunch very d@@ ark and it s the middle of winter and it s very cold outside
these are the things that we have to cont@@ end with
we understand that we liter@@ ally moved the time by one hour but it s pretty hard to convin@@ ce my constituents because they are vo@@ ic@@ ing their concerns
if we go to igloolik they will be reiter@@ ating what i m saying
it s pretty hard to convin@@ ce them
i cannot convin@@ ce my people personally so i m representing my constituency and that s why i m vo@@ ic@@ ing my concerns
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
perhaps in consideration of the premier has been saying i don t think a different response will be made
i have two more names on my list
i believe you are next mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
his colleagues are probably in the same boat and this is creating a problem
for example our premier is the s@@ po@@ k@@ es@@ person in the media
the qikiqtaaluk inuit are trying to state their views and he s over@@ riding them
as such when he s asked he kee@@ ps referring back to the need to experi@@ ment and this is seems to be the only response he can give
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
going back to bill 3 the amendments we re talking about the interpretation act
please keep onto the topics
bill 3 mr iqaqrialu was talking about the election process although what you re talking about is really good we have to speak to bill 3 the interpretation act which is an amendment to this act
i would suggest that you keep to the topic
perhaps our premier has another comment to make
do you have a response for mr iqaqrialu comments
hon paul okalik interpretation
i did forget to mention as a committee as a whole we have certain regulations and when you wanted to discuss this issue we did want to deal with it at that time
we did want to discuss it as a whole but we didn t have any time to do so and we did want to further discuss this during our session
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairman
that would be great
we do want to make changes in the communities that have decided not to go along with the time zone
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier
i received a copy and i said earlier that we have to abide by house rules
the individual in the gallery handed me a note apologi@@ zing for their actions earlier
thank you
mr nutarak
maybe a last comment
mr nutarak interpretation
bill 3 i was a bit confused
are we finished with this
we have not even voted on this
i just want to end the discussion now
chairperson interpretation
we re just under general comments
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i have no problem with this
we can t help it
it was also mentioned that we can revisit this and review it and i think that would be an appropriate time to do so
i think we know that in the baffin region this is opposed to but maybe we can just start discussing the review and then maybe we could make amendments to the bill
maybe by next year we will be able to ask questions as to which corrections can be made and maybe we ll have a better sense of what the residents in nunavut have on this bill
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
i didn t hear a questions more of a comment
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
mr nutarak did ask a question ir@@ respective of whether we oppo@@ se it or not this has already be enacted and en@@ forced
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
we have implemented it
the bill 3 just further clarifies that we have en@@ forced this so we re moving ahead to gain as@@ cent
